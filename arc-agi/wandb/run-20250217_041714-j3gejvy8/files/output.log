With completions:  ["Alright, let me try to figure out the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. So, looking at the examples provided, I see that both the input and output grids have a specific structure with a lot of zeros and a few non-zero numbers. \n\nFirst, I notice that in Example 1, the output grid has some patterns that the input grids don't. For instance, in the first few rows of the input, there are a lot of zeros except for a couple of 4s and a few 4s and 6. The output grid seems to have similar patterns, just arranged differently. \n\nIn Example 2, the output grid is the same as the input grid, except for some rows and columns that have non-zero values. The rules here seem to involve identifying specific patterns or groups of numbers that are placed in certain positions. \n\nLooking at the examples, I observe that the output grid seems to retain the non-zero values from the input grid but reorganizes them in a specific way. For example, in the first two rows of the output, there's a 0 followed by a 0, then a 0, and then the 4s. It's like the zeros are being placed in certain positions based on the input data. \n\nWait, maybe the rule is about shifting or rotating the non-zero values. For instance, in the first row of the input, there are two 4s and a 6, which in the output, these values are still present but maybe in different positions. It's a bit hard to see without visualizing the grids, but perhaps the rule involves moving certain non-zero values to specific columns.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that in the last few rows of the input, there are a lot of 4s and 6s. The output grid has these values in specific positions, like the seventh and eighth columns. This suggests that the rule involves mapping these values to specific positions, maybe based on their occurrence in the input.\n\nI think the key is to look at how the non-zero values are being positioned. In the input, some rows have multiple non-zero values, and in the output, they're arranged in a way that might involve keeping those values in certain columns or shifting them.\n\nPerhaps the rule is to identify groups of non-zero values and place them in specific columns based on their occurrence. Alternatively, it might involve the presence of certain numbers and their grouping. \n\nTo test this, I can look at a specific example. In Example 1, the input has a row with two 4s and a 6. The output for this row is a 0, followed by another 0, then a 0, and then 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0. So, the non-zero values are moved to the third and seventh columns. \n\nIn Example 2, the input and output are identical except for a row that has 0s shifted to the end. So, the rule seems to involve moving non-zero values to the end of certain rows or columns.\n\nI'm starting to think that the rule is about identifying specific patterns in the input and then moving those patterns to specific positions in the output. For example, the presence of 4s and 6s in certain rows and columns gets moved to specific positions in the output grid.\n\nTo confirm this, I can check another part of the input and output. For instance, in the fifth row of the input, I have a 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The output for this row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So, the 4 and 6 have moved to the beginning of the row in the output.\n\nThis suggests that the rule is to identify the positions of non-zero values (like 4s and 6s) and then move them to specific positions in the output grid. It might involve the order of these values and their placement.\n\nAnother observation is that the non-zero values in the output grid seem to be placed in the same columns where they were in the input, but their positions are shifted. For example, in the first few rows, the 4s and 6s are shifted to different columns.\n\nI think the rule is that in the output grid, the non-zero values appear in the same columns as they did in the input, but they are reordered based on their occurrence or their specific positions. Maybe the rule is that t

With answers:  ['\n\n<|user|><|assistant|>', "\n\nTo determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, I analyzed the examples provided. The transformation involves each row after the first being shifted to the right by one column, with the last element of each row wrapping around to align with the first element of the next row. Here's how it breaks down:\n\n1. **Identify the Shift Direction**: Each subsequent row is a right shift of the previous row. The first row remains unchanged.\n2. **Apply the Shift**: Move every element in a row to the right, causing the last element of each row to become the first element of the next row.\n\n### Final Output:\nThe output grid follows the same shift pattern as the transformation, maintaining the first row unchanged and shifting all other rows to the right by one. Here is the corresponding text output:\n\nOutput:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 7 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 8 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the underlying rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. After analyzing both examples, it becomes clear that the rule involves processing each row of the input grid. Specifically, each row in the output is identical to the corresponding row in the input, except for the last element, which is replaced with zero.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the approach:\n1. For each row in the input grid, keep all elements except the last one as they are in the output grid.\n2. In the output grid, set the last element of each row to zero, regardless of its value in the input.\n\nBy applying this rule to every row of the input, we can generate the corresponding row in the output grid. This consistent transformation across all provided examples validates the approach as correct.", '\n\nThe rule applied is that in each 2x2 block of the input grid, the 4 and 0 are swapped so that the 4 moves from the top-left to the top-right and the 0 from the bottom-right to the bottom-left. This process is consistent across all blocks in the grid.\n\n```<|user|><|assistant|>```']
