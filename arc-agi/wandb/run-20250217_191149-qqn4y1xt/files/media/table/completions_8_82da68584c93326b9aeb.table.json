The first three rows seem to have mostly zeros except for some positions where numbers are non-zero. I remember that in the input, there are points with 2s, like in row 3, column 5, and row 13, column 5. In the output, these positions are marked with 2 as well. \n\nAnother observation is that all the 0s in the output grid are either at the edges or in specific blocks. I see that the 2s are placed in the middle of the grid, and their positions are consistent across different rows. \n\nIn Example 2, I spot that the 8s are all in the first and last columns, and the 2s are again in the middle. The 0s seem to be spread out in a particular pattern. It looks like the 0s are in the corners and maybe some other specific positions. \n\nWait, in Example 3, I notice that the 2s are again placed in the same middle positions, and the 8s are in the first and last columns. There are also 0s, but their positions are different from the previous examples. \n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be that any 2 in the input grid will become a 2 in the output grid. However, there are specific positions where 8s and 0s are preserved, but 2s are introduced in certain spots. \n\nI also notice that in all examples, the 2s are placed in the center of the grid, but their exact positions depend on the input. For instance, in Example 1, the 2 is in row 3, column 5, and in Example 3, it's in row 13, column 5. \n\nSo, the rule is: wherever there's a 2 in the input grid, it will be a 2 in the output grid. Other numbers remain unchanged, except for the 8s which are preserved in their positions, and 0s which are either preserved or moved to specific places. \n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid. Let me go through each row and apply the changes where 2s are present. For rows without 2s, the 8s and 0s should remain as they are. \n\nFor example, in the first row of the test input, there are no 2s, so the 8s will remain, and the 0s will stay. Similarly, in rows where 2s are present, those positions will reflect as 2s. \n\nAfter applying this rule, the output grid should have 2s in all positions where the input had a 2, and the 8s and 0s would remain in their respective places. \n\nI think I've got it now. The rule is simply to replace every 2 in the input grid with a 2 in the output grid, while keeping the 8s and 0s as they are.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The output seems to have similar 8s in those spots, but also the last row has an 8 at (16,9). So, it looks like the output grid has an 8 in the last row if the corresponding input has an 8 in the same position, except for the tenth row where it's 2.\n\nWait, in the input, the last row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 8 is in the eleventh position (since it's 0-based). In the output, the eleventh position is 8 as well. So maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input grid results in an 8 in the output grid at the same position.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has some 2s. For instance, the fifth row has a 2 at position (6,1). In the output, that position is 2 as well. So it seems that if the input has a 2, the output keeps the 2, and otherwise, it's 0 or something else.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 3, the output has 2s only in the fifth and sixth rows, but the input had 2s in the fifth row. So the rule might be: for each cell, if the input has a 2, the output has a 2; if the input has an 8, the output has an 8; otherwise, it's 0. But wait, in the input, there are 0s and 8s, but other numbers as well. Let me check the other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a lot of 8s and 0s, but the output seems to have 8s in the same positions where the input had 8s. So probably, the rule is: wherever the input grid has an 8, the output grid keeps an 8 in that position; if it has a 2, output is 2; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 1. The input has a 2 in the second-to-last row (position 13,0). In the output, that position is 2. The last row in the input is 8, so the output has an 8. So this supports the rule: 2 remains 2, 8 remains 8, others become 0.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 2s in the fifth and sixth rows where the input had 2s. The other 2s in the output are in positions that are 0s in the input, so they remain 0. The 8s in the input remain 8s in the output. So yes, the rule seems to be: for each cell, if the input is 2, output is 2; if input is 8, output is 8; else, output is 0.\n\nSo the transformation is: output[i][j] = input[i][j] if input[i][j] is 2 or 8, else 0.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros except for some 2s in specific positions. The output grid shows these 2s being transformed into different values. Hmm, I notice that in the output, the 2s are replaced with 2, 8, or 0 in certain places. It seems like there's some pattern based on the surrounding cells.\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid starts with a bunch of zeros and then has some 8s and 2s. The output grid changes these 8s and 2s into other values. For instance, the 8s become 8s, 2s become 0s, and others stay the same. This suggests that there's a condition based on the cell values that determines the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 8s and a 2 in specific positions. The output shows that these 8s remain, but the 2 becomes a 0. This indicates that when a cell has a value of 8, it stays the same, but when it's a 2, it becomes 0. But wait, in the output, the 2s are replaced with 0s, while other numbers stay as they are. So maybe the rule is that if a cell is a 2, it becomes 0, otherwise, it stays the same. But I need to check this.\n\nLet me take a closer look at Example 2. The input grid has 8s and 2s. In the output, the 8s remain 8s, the 2s become 0s, and others remain the same. So this supports the idea that 2s are replaced with 0s, while 8s stay as 8s. But I should check other cells to be sure.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 2, the 8s stay, the 2s turn into 0s, but other numbers like 0, 4, 6, etc., stay the same. So it seems consistent.\n\nNow, looking at Example 3, the input has 8s and a 2. The output keeps the 8s the same, turns the 2 into a 0, and other cells remain unchanged. So this aligns with my previous thought.\n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be: if a cell's value is 2, it becomes 0; otherwise, it remains the same. But I should verify this with another example or by checking the rest of the data.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the cells have a 0 or 2. The output shows that 2s remain 2s, so it fits the rule. In Example 2, the 8s remain, 2s become 0s, others stay. In Example 3, 8s stay, 2 becomes 0, others stay. So yes, the rule is that any cell with a 2 becomes 0, and all other cells remain unchanged.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input grid provided, I'll replace any 2s with 0s and leave all other numbers as they are.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me look at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and a single 8 in the middle of the 8s. The output seems to have the same structure but with an extra 8 in the middle of the 8s. Wait, no, actually, in the output, the 8 on the left is followed by a 2, and then another 8. Hmm, maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, let me look again. In Example 1, the input starts with 0s and then a single 8, followed by 0s up to the middle. The output seems to have the same initial 0s, then another 0, followed by a 2, then 0s again. But that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nMaybe I should look at another example. Example 2 shows an input where the 8s are spread out, and the output also has these 8s but with a different arrangement. It looks like the rule is that any 8 in the input is carried over to the output, while zeros are replaced by 0s, but perhaps there's more to it.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has a lot of 8s and a 2 in the middle. The output seems to have a similar structure but with the 2 shifted a bit. Also, in the output, the 2s are appearing in different positions compared to the input.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that any cell with a non-zero value (like 2, 8, etc.) is preserved in the output, while zeros are replaced by zeros. But that doesn't explain the changes in Example 3 where a 2 is transformed into an 8 or vice versa.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has an 8 on the left and a 2 in the middle. The output has an 8 on the left, a 2, followed by zeros, and then another 8. So it seems like the 2 is being converted into an 8, but only in certain positions.\n\nLet me try to think of a possible transformation. Maybe any zero in the input is replaced by zero, and any non-zero value is carried over. But in Example 3, the 2 is turned into an 8, which contradicts that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being replaced by 8s in specific locations. Looking at the output, the 2 in the input (third last row) becomes an 8 in the fifth row, and the 8 in the last row becomes a 2 in the sixth row. This suggests that certain cells are being replaced by others.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any cell with a 2 becomes an 8, and any cell with an 8 becomes a 2. Let me check this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the middle. The output shows the same 2, but with a 0 in the middle? Wait, no, looking back: in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the middle, and the output has a 0 there. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input is:\n[...]\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the middle of the 8s. The output shows that the 2 becomes a 0 in the middle, and another 8 appears. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at a specific cell to understand the transformation. Let's take the cell at position (1,1) in Example 1.\n\nInput: 0\nOutput: 0\n\nThat's consistent. Another cell: (2,1) is 0, output is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a 2 becomes an 8, and any cell with an 8 becomes a 2, but zeros are kept as zeros. But in Example 1, the input has a 2, which in the output becomes a 0 in the middle. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let me look at Example 2. The input has a 2 in the middle of the 8s, and the output does the same. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value in the input is preserved in the output, but zeros are kept as zeros. But that doesn't explain the changes in Example 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a 2 becomes an 8, and any cell with an 8 becomes a 2, regardless of the position. Let's test this against Example 3.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 2 in the last position of the first row. The output has a 2 in the first position. So that fits. The input has an 8 in the last position of the first row; the output has an 8 in the last position. So that fits. The input has a 2 in the last position of the second row; the output has a 0 in the last position, which contradicts that. Wait, no, in the output, the last row has a 0, while the input had an 8. So perhaps the rule is not that simple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being replaced by 8s in specific positions, like the end of the row. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 3, the last row of the input is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], and the output is the same. So that fits. The row before that has a 2 in the last position, and the output has a 0 in that position. Hmm, so that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are being turned into 8s in certain columns, like the 11th column. Let me check.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the last row has 8s, and the row before has a 2 in the 11th column, which in the output becomes a 0. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being replaced by 8s in the same positions where the 8s were in the input. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has an 8 in the 11th position of the last row, and the output has an 8 in the 11th position. The input has a 2 in the 11th position of the second last row, and the output has a 0 in that position. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any 2 in the input is replaced by an 8, and any 8 is left as is. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the middle and an 8s. The output has a 0 in the middle, which doesn't fit. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being replaced by 0s, and the 8s are being replaced by 2s. But in Example 3, the last row has 8s, so according to that rule, they become 2s, which is not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input is carried over, but any 2s are replaced by 8s, and zeros are kept as zeros. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has an 8, so it remains. The 2 is replaced by 8, but in the output, it's still 8. Wait, no, in the output, the 2 is turned into a 0 in the middle. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at another example.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the output has a 0 where the input had a 2, and vice versa. The input had a 2 in the last row of the first two rows, and the output has 0s there, while the input had 8s elsewhere. So perhaps the rule is that any 2 is replaced by 0, and any 8 is replaced by 2.\n\nWait, let me test that.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, which would become 0 in the output. But in the output, the 2 in the middle is turned into 0, and the 8s remain. So that fits. The input has an 8, which would become 2, but in the output, it remains 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 0 in the input is kept as 0, any 2 is replaced by 8, and any 8 is replaced by 2. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, which would become 8, but in the output, the 2 is turned into 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 2 in the input is replaced by 8, and any 8 is replaced by 2. Let's consider that.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 2 in the last row of the first two rows. According to the rule, that 2 would become 8, but the output has 0s there. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that any cell with a 2 or 8 in the input is converted to 8 or 2, but zeros are kept as zeros. But in Example 1, the 2 becomes a 0, which contradicts that.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any 2 in the input is replaced by 8 in the output, but zeros are kept as zeros. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input's last row has 8s, so they remain 8s. The row before has a 2, which would become 8, but in the output, it's still 8. Wait, no, in the output, the 2 is turned into 8, but in the input, the 8 remains. So that fits.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any 0 is replaced by 0, any 2 is replaced by 8, and any 8 is kept as 8. Let's test:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, which becomes 8 in the output. But in the output, the 2 in the middle is turned into 0. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being replaced by 0s, and the 8s are being replaced by 2s.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 becomes 0, and the 8 remains 8. That fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 becomes 0, and the 8 remains 8. That fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the last row has 8s, which remain 8s. The row before has a 2, which becomes 0. That fits.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- Any cell with a 2 becomes a 0.\n- Any cell with an 8 remains an 8.\n- Zeros remain zeros.\n\nLet me apply this rule to the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, which becomes 0 in the output, and the 8s remain. That matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2s become 0s, and the 8s remain. The output matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the 2 becomes 0, and the 8s remain. That matches.\n\nSo this seems to be the rule.\n\nNow, I need to apply this rule to the Input 2 and Output 2 to see if it works.\n\nLooking at Output 2:\n\nThe input has a 0, and the output has a 0. That fits.\n\nA cell with a 2 becomes 0. So in Output 2, the first row has a 0 where the input had a 2. Let me check:\n\nInput for Output 2:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the cell at position (1,5) is 8, which remains 8. The cell at position (1,12) is 8, which remains 8. The cell at position (1,13) is 0, which remains 0.\n\nWait, but in Output 2, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nWait, but according to the rule, anything that was 8 remains 8, so that cell should remain 8.\n\nHmm, but in the output, the 8 is at position 13, which was 0 in the input. Wait, no, in the input, the 8 was at position 12, and the output has a 0 there. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the positions.\n\nWait, the input grid is a 30x20 grid, and the output is also 30x20. Each row has 20 cells.\n\nLooking at the first row of Output 2:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the cell at position (1,13) is 8, which was originally 0 in the input. That doesn't fit the rule.\n\nSo perhaps my initial assumption about the rule is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any cell with a 2 or 8 is replaced by 0, but zeros are kept as zeros. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, which becomes 0, and the 8 remains 8. That fits the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 becomes 0, and the 8 remains 8. That fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the 2 becomes 0, and the 8 remains 8. That fits.\n\nBut in Output 2, the first row has a 0 where the input had an 8, which contradicts this rule.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that any 8 remains 8, any 2 becomes 0, and zeros are kept as zeros. That seems to fit the examples, but the discrepancy in Output 2 suggests that perhaps I'm miscounting the input or the output.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the input for Output 2.\n\nInput for Output 2:\n\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, that's a single 8 at position (5,5) and another at (12,5). So according to the rule, these should remain as 8s. But in the output, the first row has 0s, which suggests that something is changing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the output is generated. Maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input is preserved, any 2 is replaced by 0, and zeros are kept as zeros. But the output in Output 2 has 0s where the input had 8s, which would contradict this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 2 is replaced by 8, and any 8 is replaced by 2, and zeros are kept as zeros. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, which becomes 8, but in the output, it's still 8. The 8 remains 8.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a bunch of zeros and a 2 somewhere in the middle. The output grid seems to have a 2 in the second row and the last two rows. The 2 is in a position that's shifted a bit compared to the input. So maybe the 2 is moving up or down.\n\nIn Example 2, I notice that the first few rows become zeros, while the last two rows have an 8 and a 2. The 8s are in the same positions as in Example 1, and the 2 shifts to the end of the grid. This suggests that the 2 is being moved towards the bottom.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the structure changes a bit. There's a row with multiple 8s and another with a single 2. The 2 is moving from the middle to the right side of the grid. It seems like the 2 is being pushed towards the right edge each time.\n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be that a single 2 in the input is moved towards the right edge of the grid, one position to the right each time. The rest of the grid remains the same, and only the 2 shifts.\n\nSo, in the test input given, I'll check where the 2 is. It's in the third row, first column. Applying the rule, it should be moved one position to the right, so it will be in the third row, second column.\n\nLet me reconstruct the output grid based on this understanding. I'll keep all other elements the same and place the 2 in the correct position.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples and see if I can spot any patterns or rules that could explain the transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a couple of 8s. The output grid has mostly zeros, but in the lower-left part, there are some 8s. The input has an 8 in the 8th row, 8th column, and another 8 in the 9th row, 8th column. The output grid also has 8s in those positions. It seems like maybe the 8s are being preserved or moved in some way.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a lot of 0s and a mixture of 0s and 8s. The output grid has some 8s in the same positions where the input had 8s, but it also has some changes. Hmm, perhaps the rule is that certain 8s are moved or modified, but others stay the same. I need to look closer.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a couple of 2s. The output grid has 2s in different positions. For instance, the 2s are in the 8th row, 8th column, and the 9th row, 8th column. Wait, no, in the output, the 2s are in the 8th and 9th rows, but in the input, the 2s are in the 8th and 9th rows as well. So maybe the rule is that the 2s are being moved to specific positions.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 8s are in specific positions. Let's see how they move. In Example 1's input, the first 8 is in row 8, column 8, and the second 8 is in row 9, column 8. The output has the same positions, so perhaps the rule is that 8s are staying in place but maybe some other transformations are happening.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that when a cell has a value, it's either left alone or changes based on some condition. Let me think about how the input and output grids differ.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 10, column 0, which in the output remains as 0. Another cell has 2 in row 9, column 0, which in the output becomes 0. So maybe the rule is that if a cell has a value, it's only modified if it's a 0, and the rule is to move non-zero values to specific positions.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has some cells where the input had 8s, but others changed. For example, in the first row, the input had 0s, and the output had 0s as well. The second row in the input has 0s and 8s, and the output seems to have 0s and 8s in some swapped positions.\n\nMaybe the rule is that each non-zero cell in the input grid is moved to a specific location based on the position of the cell. For example, a cell at (i,j) is moved to (j,i) or some other transformation.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 8 in row 8, column 8, in the input, is in the same position in the output. So perhaps the rule is that 8s stay in place. Similarly, in Example 2, there's a 2 in row 8, column 0 in the input, which moves to row 8, column 0 in the output, but wait, in the output of Example 2, the 2 is in row 7, column 8, which is different. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each non-zero cell, it's replaced by another cell's value, but that seems more complex.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3, the input has a lot of 2s, and the output has 2s in different positions. For instance, the 2 in row 8, column 0 in the input is in row 7, column 8 in the output. Wait, no, in Example 3, the input's row 8, column 0 is 2, but the output's row 7, column 8 is 0. Hmm, perhaps that's not the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each cell, if the value is 2, it's moved to the position of the value's original position in a mirrored way. For example, (i,j) becomes (j,i). Let me check that.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 in row 8, column 8 would stay the same. But in Example 2, the 2 in row 8, column 0 would move to row 0, column 8. But in the output, the 2 in row 7, column 8 is moved to row 8, column 7. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that a cell's value is replaced by the value of the cell that's in the mirrored position. For example, if a cell at (i,j) is non-zero, it's replaced by the value at (j,i). Let me test that.\n\nIn Example 1, the cell at (8,8) would remain 8. The cell at (9,8) would be replaced by the cell at (8,9), but in the input, (8,9) is 0, so it remains 0. Similarly, the cell at (10,8) would be replaced by (8,10), which is 0. So the 2s in (10,0) and (9,0) would remain 2s because their mirrored positions are 0s.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the input has a 2 in row 8, column 0. If we mirror it, it would go to row 0, column 8. But in the output, the 2 is at row 7, column 8. So perhaps that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell is replaced by the value of the cell in its mirrored position, but only if that mirrored cell is non-zero. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 in (8,8) is non-zero, so it stays. The 2 in (10,0) would mirror to (0,10), which is 0, so it remains 2. Similarly, the 2 in (9,0) mirrors to (0,9), which is 0, so it remains 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 in (8,0) mirrors to (0,8), which is 0, so it remains 2. The 8s in (7,8) and (8,7) would mirror to (8,7) and (7,8), which are 8s, so they remain.\n\nHmm, but in Example 3, the 2s are at different positions. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 2 at (8,0). Its mirror would be (0,8), which is 0, so it remains 2. The 2 at (9,0) mirrors to (0,9), which is 0, so it remains. The 2s in (7,8) and (8,7) mirror to (8,7) and (7,8), which are 8s, so they remain.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's output, the 2s are in different positions. For instance, the 2 in (8,0) is now in (7,8), and the 2 in (9,0) is in (8,7). So perhaps the rule is that each 2 is replaced by a 2 from a different position, perhaps moving it to the mirrored position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each cell (i,j), if the value is 2, it is replaced by the value of the cell (j,i). But when a cell is replaced, it could change its value, which might affect other cells.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each cell (i,j), if it's non-zero, it's set to the value of cell (j,i). But that would cause the values to be swapped, possibly leading to more changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell's value is replaced by the value of the cell in its mirrored position, but only if that mirrored cell is non-zero. So for example, in a 10x10 grid, the cell (i,j) would be replaced by (j,i). So if (i,j) is non-zero, it becomes (j,i)'s value. But if (j,i) is zero, then (i,j) remains non-zero.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. In the input, (8,8) is 8, so it stays 8. (10,0) is 2, so it mirrors to (0,10), which is 0, so it remains 2. Similarly, (9,0) mirrors to (0,9), which is 0, so it remains 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2s at (8,0) and (9,0) mirror to (0,8) and (0,9), which are 0s, so they remain. The 8s at (7,8) and (8,7) mirror to (8,7) and (7,8), which are 8s, so they remain.\n\nIn Example 3, the 2s at (8,0) mirror to (0,8), which is 0, so it remains 2. The 2s at (9,0) mirror to (0,9), which is 0, so they remain. The 2 in (7,8) mirrors to (8,7), which is 8, so it changes to 8. Similarly, the 2 in (8,7) mirrors to (7,8), which is 8, so it changes to 8. The 8s at (8,8) and (9,8) mirror to (8,8) and (8,9), which are 8s and 0, so they remain.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's output, the 8s in (8,8) and (9,8) remain the same, which would be consistent with the rule. The 2 in (7,8) becomes 8 in (8,7), and vice versa.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: for each cell (i,j), if it's non-zero, it's replaced by the value of cell (j,i). If (j,i) is non-zero, then it's updated to that value, which might cause other cells to change. This seems to be a plausible rule.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, I see that the 2s have swapped their positions, and the 8s have mirrored but not changed. So this aligns with the rule.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each cell's value is being swapped with its mirrored counterpart, but only if both are non-zero. So, for each cell (i,j), if both (i,j) and (j,i) are non-zero, then their values are swapped. Otherwise, the value remains as is.\n\nThis makes sense because in the examples, the non-zero cells are either staying the same or swapping positions with their mirrored counterparts, which fits the rule.\n\nSo, to summarize, the rule is: For each cell (i,j), if the value is non-zero, it is replaced by the value of the cell at (j,i). This means that the cell's value is swapped with its mirrored counterpart unless both are non-zero, in which case both change to each other's values.\n\nI think that's the rule applied to the examples. Now, applying this rule to the input of Example 3, I can see that it works as the output shows the 2s swapped and the 8s mirrored without changing their values.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are three examples provided, and I need to figure out what's happening. Let me start by carefully examining the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a single 8 in certain positions. The output grid seems to have 8s in those same positions but also some additional 2s. For instance, the last few rows in the output have 8s and a 2. I wonder if the rule involves moving 8s in a particular direction.\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid has a lot of 0s and a 8, and the output also has 8s in those positions. However, the output grid also has some 8s and 2s in other places. It looks like maybe the rule is to keep the existing 8s and add more 8s next to them, but I'm not sure exactly how.\n\nExample 3 seems similar to Example 2 but with different arrangements. The output grid has 2s in certain spots where the input had 8s. The last few rows have 2s instead of 8s. It might be that 2s are added when 8s are present.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the maximum between the input cell and 8. But in Example 1, the output doesn't have any 2s beyond the initial 8, so that might not be it. Or maybe it's addition, but then I see 8s and 2s. Alternatively, perhaps it's about parity or something else.\n\nI notice in Example 1 that the last row in the output has an 8 and a 2. The input in the last row had two 8s and a 2. Maybe when two 8s are adjacent, a 2 is added in between. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea is that the rule might involve some kind of shift or transformation based on the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is 8, it might influence its neighbors. But without seeing more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, maybe the rule is to replace any 0s with 8s except where the input had an 8. But that doesn't fit because in Example 1, the output doesn't have 8s in the same positions as the input. It has 8s in some places and 2s in others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to add 2s next to the existing 8s. For example, whenever an 8 is present, the adjacent cells become 2s. But I need to check Example 2 and 3 to see.\n\nIn Example 2, the output grid has 8s where the input had 8s, and 2s where the input had something else. So maybe the rule is that 8s remain, and any surrounding 0s become 2s.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output has 8s where the input had 8s and 2s where the input had 0s but adjacent to 8s. That seems consistent with the previous hypothesis.\n\nSo, putting it together, the rule is: for each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the input is 8, then the output cell remains 8. If the input cell is 0, then the output cell becomes 2; otherwise, it remains 0. This explains why in Example 1, the 8s remained, and the 0s became 2s, but in the output, there were additional 2s in certain positions.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output also has 8s in the same positions as the input. So the rule is: the output cell is 8 if the input is 8; if the input is 0, it's 2; otherwise, it's 0. That matches Example 1.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 8s where the input had 8s, and 2s where the input had 0s next to 8s. So the rule is the same.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 8s where the input had 8s, 2s where the input had 0s adjacent to 8s, and 8s where the input had 8s but were also 8s.\n\nSo, the rule is: the output cell is 8 if the input cell is 8; 2 if the input cell is 0 and the adjacent cell is 8; and 0 otherwise.\n\nTherefore, applying this rule to the test input grid provided should yield the correct output.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me try to understand what's going on step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the examples provided, it seems like there are two distinct patterns. The first example has a lot of zeros and some 2s, and the output seems to have a similar structure but with the 2s replaced in specific places. The second example shows more 8s and 2s, and the output is more complex with different groupings of numbers. The third example is similar but with a different arrangement of 2s.\n\nI think the key here is to see how the numbers change from input to output. Let's start by comparing the input and output grids.\n\nIn the first example, the input grid has some 8s and 0s, and the output has 0s everywhere except for a couple of 2s. It looks like whenever there's an 8 in the input, it becomes a 2 in the output, but only in certain positions. The 2s are placed in the last row of the last 8s block.\n\nMoving to the second example, the input has 0s and 8s, and the output has a 0 where the input was 8, but also has more 8s and 2s in certain areas. It seems like the 2s are now appearing in the positions where the input had 8s, but their positions vary. The 8s in the output might be coming from the original 8s in the input minus the 2s that were placed.\n\nThe third example is similar to the first but with different positions for the 2s. It seems like the 2s are being placed differently based on the specific blocks in the input.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the rule involves two main operations:\n\n1. **Identify blocks of 8s and replace each 8 with a 2.** This happens in specific areas of the grid, particularly in the lower right corners of the 8 blocks.\n\n2. **Adjust the 8s by subtracting 2s where necessary.** This seems to be the inverse operation, where existing 8s are reduced by two to become 6s, but the 2s are added back in certain positions.\n\nWait, but looking at the second example, the output has more 8s than the input. That doesn't align with just adding or subtracting. Maybe it's a combination of both operations. For instance, the 8s are being reduced by 2s, and the 2s are being added where the 8s were.\n\nLet me test this idea. In the second example, the input has a block of 8s and some 2s. The output has 8s where the input had 8s, but with 6s and 2s added where the input had 2s. That makes sense because 8 minus 2 is 6, and 2 plus 2 is 4, but in the output, it seems like the 2s are added where the 8s were, resulting in 2s becoming 4s, but in the output, it's showing 2s and 8s again. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 8s become 2s in specific areas, and in other areas, where there was a 2, it's replaced with 8s. For example, in the last row of the last 8s block, every 2 is replaced with an 8. That would explain the first example's output.\n\nWait, in the first example, the output has 2s in the last row, but not in the 8s block. That seems inconsistent. Maybe I need to look at specific positions.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n... and so on.\n\nWait no, the first example's input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIt seems like the 8s in the input are being converted to 2s in the output. But where exactly?\n\nWait, looking closer, the output has 2s in the last row of the last block. So perhaps whenever there's an 8 in the input, it's replaced with a 2 in the output, but only in the specific positions where the 8s are in the lower right 3x3 block.\n\nIn the third example, the 2s are placed in different positions, so perhaps the rule is that in certain regions of the grid, any 8 becomes a 2, and in other regions, any 2 becomes an 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of both operations. For instance, 8s become 2s, and 2s become 8s, depending on their position.\n\nLet me think about the second example:\n\nInput has 8s and 2s. The output shows 0s, 8s, and 2s, but it seems like where the input had 8s, the output has 8s, but some 8s are converted to 6s, and 2s are converted to 8s.\n\nWait, in the second example's output, there are 8s and 2s. For example, the first few rows have 0s followed by 8s and 2s. It's a bit confusing. Maybe the rule is that in certain blocks, 8s become 2s, and in other places, 2s become 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 8s become 2s, and 2s become 0s. But that doesn't fit because the output doesn't have 0s in the first example.\n\nWait, no, the first example's output has 0s everywhere except for 2s. So the 2s are converted from 8s, but other 8s remain as 8s.\n\nIn the second example, the output has 0s where the input had 8s, but also has 8s and 2s. So perhaps when an 8 is in a certain area, it becomes a 2, and when a 2 is in a certain area, it becomes an 8.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that for any 8, it becomes a 2 in the output, and for any 2, it becomes an 8 in the output. But in the first example, the 2s remained 2s, so that doesn't fit. Wait, in the first example, the input has 8s and 2s, but the output has 0s except for 2s. So perhaps the 2s are transformed into 8s, but the 8s are transformed into 0s? That doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that 8s are turned into 2s, and 2s are turned into 8s. But in the first example, the 8s remain 8s, and the 2s remain 2s. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 8s are turned into 2s, and 2s are turned into 0s. But in the first example, the 2s are only in the last row, so perhaps it's specific.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in a certain block becomes a 2, and any 2 in the same block becomes an 8. So, for example, in the last 3x3 block, 8s become 2s, and 2s become 8s.\n\nLooking at the second example, the output shows 8s where the input had 8s, and 2s where the input had 2s. So that fits this rule.\n\nIn the third example, the 2s are placed in different positions, so again, 8s become 2s in certain areas, and 2s become 8s in others.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule is:\n\n- **For any 8 in specific regions (like the lower right 3x3 block), replace it with a 2.**\n- **For any 2 in specific regions, replace it with an 8.**\n- **For all other numbers (like 0, 4, 6), leave them as they are.**\n\nLet me test this against the examples.\n\n**First Example Input:**\n\nThe input is mostly 0s and some 8s and a couple of 2s. The output should have 0s everywhere except where the input had 8s turned into 2s and 2s turned into 8s.\n\nWait, but looking at the first example's output, it has 2s in the last row, which were originally 2s, so perhaps that's not happening. So maybe only 8s turn into 2s in the specified areas, and 2s turn into 8s elsewhere, but not in the same area.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that 8s are converted to 2s in certain regions, and 2s are converted to 0s elsewhere. But in the first example, the 2s remained 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 8s become 2s, and 2s become 8s, but only in specific regions.\n\nWait, in the third example, the 2s are placed in different positions, so the rule must be that 8s become 2s in certain regions, and 2s become 8s elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in certain blocks, 8s become 2s, and in other blocks, 2s become 8s. For example, in the lower right block, 8s become 2s, but 2s in other regions become 8s.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has some 8s and a couple of 2s. The output has 0s except for the 2s in the last row. So perhaps the 2s in the output are the result of 8s in the input turning into 2s, and other 2s in the input turning into 8s elsewhere.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should write down the transformation steps based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the last 3x3 block becomes a 2, and any 2 outside of that block becomes an 8.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let's see:\n\n- In the last 3x3 block (the lower right of the grid), any 8 becomes a 2, and any 2 becomes a 0.\n- For all other blocks, any 2 becomes an 8, and other numbers remain the same.\n\nBut that doesn't fit the first example, because in the first example's output, the 2s are in the last row, which are outside of the last 3x3 block. So perhaps the rule is that 8s become 2s, and 2s become 0s in the last 3x3 block, while other 2s become 8s.\n\nBut in the first example, the 2s are turned into 8s, not 0s. So maybe it's the opposite.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the last 3x3 block, 8s become 2s, and 2s become 0s. But in the first example, the 2s remain 2s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in the last 3x3 block, 8s become 2s, and 2s become 8s, but only in specific positions.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to code the transformation based on the examples.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Identify regions where 8s in the last 3x3 block should become 2s.**\n2. **Identify regions where 2s outside of that area should become 8s.**\n3. **Apply these transformations to the input grid to get the output.**\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look for a pattern where 8s and 2s are transformed based on their position.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput has some 8s and a couple of 2s. The output has 0s everywhere except the 2s in the last row.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that 8s in the last 3x3 block become 2s, and 2s outside of that block become 8s.\n\nBut in the first example's output, the 2s remain 2s, not 8s. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 8s become 2s in the last 3x3 block, and 2s become 0s in the last 3x3 block. Then, other 2s become 8s.\n\nBut in the first example, the 2s remain 2s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 8s become 2s, and any 2s in the input remain 2s, unless they are in the last 3x3 block, which become 0s.\n\nWait, that might explain the first example, where the 2s are turned into 8s? No, the output has 2s in the last row, so perhaps that's not it.\n\nI think I need to approach this differently. Maybe the rule is that in certain blocks, 8s become 2s, and in other blocks, 2s become 8s. For example, in the last 3x3 block, 8s become 2s, and 2s become 0s.\n\nWait, let's test this:\n\n- In the last 3x3 block, any 8 becomes 2.\n- Any 2 becomes 0.\n- All other numbers remain the same.\n\nBut in the first example, the output has 2s in the last row, which are outside of the last 3x3 block, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 8s become 2s, and 2s become 8s, but only in specific positions.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nLooking at the second example:\n\nInput has 0s, 8s, and 2s. The output has 0s except for 8s and 2s. The 8s are in the same positions as the input, but some 8s are turned into 6s, and 2s are turned into 8s.\n\nWait, in the output, there are 8s where the input had 8s, and 2s where the input had 2s, but some 8s turned into 6s elsewhere. That suggests that 8s become 2s, and 2s become 8s.\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\n- **Any 8 becomes a 2, except in the last 3x3 block where 8s become 0s.**\n- **Any 2 becomes an 8, except in the last 3x3 block where 2s become 0s.**\n\nWait, that might fit. Let me test this with the first example.\n\nIn the first example's input, the last row has 8s and a 2. The output has 8s in the last row except for the 2s turned into 8s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only 8s in the last 3x3 block become 2s, and 2s outside of that block become 8s.\n\nIn the first example, the 2s are outside the last 3x3 block, so they should become 8s. But the output has 2s in the last row, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the third example's output, the 2s are placed in different positions, so perhaps the rule is that 8s become 2s in certain areas, and 2s become 8s elsewhere.\n\nIn the third example, the 2s are placed in the last few rows, so perhaps it's in the same pattern as the first example.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput has some 8s and a couple of 2s. The output has 0s everywhere except for 2s in the last row.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the last 3x3 block becomes a 2, and any 2 outside of that block becomes an 8.\n\nBut in the first example, the 2s are outside the last 3x3 block, so they should become 8s, but the output has 2s, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in the last 3x3 block, 8s become 2s, and in all other blocks, 2s become 8s.\n\nIn the first example, the 2s are outside the last 3x3 block, so they should become 8s, but the output has 2s. So that's not matching.\n\nI think I'm missing something obvious. Let me try to describe the rule based on the examples.\n\nThe rule seems to involve two parts:\n\n1. **In the last 3x3 block, every 8 becomes a 2.**\n2. **In all other parts of the grid, every 2 becomes an 8.**\n\nBut let's test this with the first example.\n\nIn the first example's input, the last row has 8s and a 2. According to the rule:\n\n- The 8s in the last row would become 2s.\n- The 2 outside the last block would become 8", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I have three examples to work with, so I'll go through each one step by step to understand the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output are quite similar except for a specific cell. The input is a matrix where the middle cell of the last row has an 8 instead of a 2. The output seems to have that 8 turned into a 2. So perhaps the rule is that when a 2 is in a certain position, it gets replaced with an 8, but in Example 1, that specific 2 is transformed into a 0. Wait, that contradicts my initial thought. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, and the output also has a 0 there. So maybe the rule is different. Maybe the rule is that any occurrence of 2 in certain positions gets converted, but looking more closely, in Example 1, the last row has an 8 in the middle, and the output also has an 8 there. So perhaps the rule is that any 2 in the last row of the last 8 rows is converted to a 0, and other 2s are left as is. Or maybe it's the opposite.\n\nWait, looking at the input and output again, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the last row, middle position, and the output has an 8 there. So perhaps the rule is that any 2 in the last row is converted to an 8, but that's not consistent with other examples. Let's look at Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, and the output has an 8 there. So again, it seems like when there's a 2 in the input, it's converted to 8 in the output. But in Example 3, the input has 0s except for the last row, which has 8s. The output also has 8s in the last row, middle position, but there's no 2 here. So the rule seems to be that any 2 in the input is converted to an 8 in the output, and other cells remain the same.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, and the output also has a 0. So maybe the rule is that 2 becomes 0, and 0 remains 0. Let me check Example 2. The input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, and the output has an 8 there. So that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the output grid, every cell that is 2 in the input grid is replaced by 8, but any cell that is 0 remains 0. Let me see if that fits all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the last row, middle position, and the output has an 8 there. So that fits. But in the output, the last row, middle position is 0. Wait, no. In Example 1, the output is all zeros except for the last row, middle position which is 0. So that doesn't fit. So my earlier thought is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 2 in the input grid is converted to 8, and all other cells remain the same. Let me test this with Example 1. The input in the last row has a 2 in the middle, and the output has an 8 there. That fits. But in the output, the last row, middle position is 0, which is different from the input's 2. Wait, no, the output in Example 1's last row is all zeros except for the middle position, which is 0. That's inconsistent with the rule. So my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 2 in the input grid is converted to 0, and all other cells are left as is. Let me see. In Example 1, the input has a 2 in the last row, middle position, and the output has a 0 there. That fits. But in the output, the last row, middle position is 0, which matches. Now, looking at Example 2, the input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, which would remain 0 in the output. But in the output, the last row, middle position is 8. So that contradicts the rule. So the rule cannot be that 2 becomes 0 and 0 remains 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 2 in the input grid is converted to 0, but other 0s remain 0. Let's check. In Example 1, the input has a 2 in the last row, middle position, and the output has a 0 there. That fits. But in the output, the last row, middle position is 0, which matches. However, in Example 2, the input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, and the output has an 8 there. So that contradicts the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 2 in the input grid is converted to 8, and any 8 is converted to 2, but that doesn't fit the examples either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 0 in the input grid is converted to 0, and any 2 is converted to 0, while other values remain the same. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the last row, middle position, and the output has a 0 there. That fits. But in the output, the last row, middle position is 0, which matches. However, in Example 2, the input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, and the output has an 8 there. So that contradicts the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 2 in the input grid is converted to 0, but other 0s remain 0, and other 8s remain 8. Let me see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the last row, middle position, which becomes 0 in the output. That fits. But in the output, the last row, middle position is 0, which matches. However, in Example 2, the input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, which remains 0 in the output. That fits. But in Example 3, the input has 8s in the last row, which remain 8s in the output. So this seems to fit.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, and the output also has a 0 there, which matches. So the rule could be that any 2 in the input grid is converted to 0, and other cells remain the same. Let me check all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the last row, middle position, which becomes 0 in the output. That matches. In Example 2, the input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, which remains 0. That matches. In Example 3, the input has 8s in the last row, which remain 8s in the output. That matches. So this seems to be the rule.\n\nSo the rule is: in the output grid, any 2 in the input grid is converted to 0, and all other cells remain the same.\n\nLet me apply this rule to Example 2. The input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, which remains 0 in the output. However, in the output, the last row, middle position is 8, which contradicts the rule. So my rule is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 2 in the input grid is converted to 8, and any 8 is converted to 2, but that doesn't fit the examples either.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 2 in the input grid is converted to 0, and 0s are converted to 8s. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the last row, middle position, which becomes 0. But in the output, the last row, middle position is 0. So that fits. However, in Example 2, the input has a 0 in the last row, middle position, which remains 0. That fits. In Example 3, the input has 8s in the last row, which remain 8s. So this seems to fit except for the first example, where the output's last row, middle position is 0 instead of 2.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the output's last row, middle position is 0, which is the result of converting 2 to 0. So that fits. So perhaps the rule is correct.\n\nLet me test it again. The rule is: any 2 in the input becomes 0, and all other cells remain the same. This seems to fit all the examples.\n\nSo applying this rule, in the output grid, all cells that were 2 in the input are now 0, and other cells remain unchanged.\n\nSo for the input given in the test case, I need to go through each cell and apply the rule: if the cell is 2, set it to 0; otherwise, leave it as it is.\n\nLet me apply this rule to the test case input.\n\nThe input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule, any 2 in the input becomes 0. So the first 8 in the first row becomes 0, the 2 in the 5th row becomes 0, and the 8s remain as they are.\n\nLet me construct the output step by step:\n\n1.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided and see if I can spot any patterns or similarities.\n\nFirst, I'll examine Example 1. The input grid has a lot of zeros and a single 8 in the middle. The output grid seems to have 2s in the positions where the 8 is, but only in certain places. Wait, in the output, the 8s are preserved, and there are 2s in specific spots. Maybe the rule is about replacing zeros with 2s in certain rows and columns.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has multiple 8s and a 2 elsewhere. The output seems to have 8s in the same positions as the input, but with some 2s added or changed. For instance, in the last few rows, there's a 2 replacing an 8 where the input had a 8 and another 2. That suggests that when an 8 exists in the input, the output keeps it as an 8, and when a 2 is present, it becomes an 8 in the output. But why are those 2s appearing in certain parts?\n\nWait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me check the output of Example 2 again. The output has 8s wherever the input had 8s or 2s, but in some cases, a 2 in the input becomes an 8 in the output. For example, in the last few rows, the output has 8s where the input had 8s and 2s, but with an extra 8 where a 2 was present. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a lot of 8s and a 2 in the middle. The output seems to have 2s where the input had 8s, but in the last few rows, there are 8s replacing 2s. So maybe when an 8 is in the input, the output keeps it, and when a 2 is in the input, it becomes an 8 in the output. But I need to verify this.\n\nLet me take another example. In Example 1, the input has an 8 in the middle, and the output has 2s there. So that supports the idea that 8 in the input becomes 2 in the output. Also, in the output, some 8s are preserved, like the first row, which is all zeros, but in the input, the first row is mostly zeros except for the middle which is an 8. Wait, no, in Example 1, the first row is all zeros, but the fifth row has a 2. So maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes a 2 in the output, and 2s in the input remain 2s. But in Example 2, the input has a 2, and the output has 8s in some places where the input had 8s and 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input is replaced by a 2 in the output. And any 2 in the input remains a 2. So in the output, wherever the input has an 8, it's a 2, and wherever it has a 2, it's a 2. But looking at Example 1, the 8 in the input becomes a 2 in the output, which fits. In Example 2, the input has 8s, so the output has 2s in the same positions. Also, the input has a 2, so the output has 8s where the input had 2s. Wait, no, in the output of Example 2, the last few rows have 8s where the input had 2s. So perhaps the rule is that in the output, an 8 is present if either an 8 or a 2 was in the input, but in some cases, it's replaced.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes a 2 in the output, and any 2 in the input remains a 2. So in the output, all 8s are where the input had 8s, and the 2s where the input had 2s. Wait, but in the output of Example 2, the last few rows have 8s where the input had 2s. So that contradicts that idea. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes 2 in the output, and any 2 in the input becomes 8 in the output. That would fit the examples:\n\n- Example 1: The input has an 8, so the output has a 2.\n- Example 2: The input has a 2, so the output has an 8.\n- Example 3: The input has an 8, so the output has a 2 in those positions.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the input has a 2 in the last few rows, and the output has 8s in those places, which supports this rule. However, in Example 1, the output has 2s where the input had 8s, which also fits.\n\nSo, the rule is: wherever there's an 8 in the input, the output has a 2 there. And wherever there's a 2 in the input, the output has an 8 there. But then, in the first row of Example 1, all are zeros, so it doesn't matter. But in other rows, like the fifth row of Example 1, it's all zeros, but in the output, the fifth row is mostly zeros except for the 2 in the middle.\n\nWait, no, in the output of Example 1, the fifth row is mostly zeros except for a 2 in the middle. So that fits the rule: an 8 becomes a 2.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 2s where the input had 8s, and 8s where the input had 2s. So the rule holds.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: in the output, any 8 in the input becomes a 2, and any 2 in the input becomes an 8. Zeros are left as is.\n\nSo, to apply this rule, I'll go through each cell in the input grid and apply this transformation to get the output grid.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, the task is to find a rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid and then apply that rule to the provided test input.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids are quite similar except for a few cells. In the input, there are a lot of zeros and a few 8s and a 2. In the output, the 2s are in different positions compared to the input. I notice that in the input, the 2 is located in the 8th row and 10th column, while in the output, the 2 is in the 9th row and 10th column. Hmm, maybe the 2s are being moved down by one position each time?\n\nWait, let me check the 8th row of the input. In the input, the 8th row is 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. In the output, the 8th row becomes 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So, actually, the 2 is moved down from the 8th position to the 9th position. That makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, in the 9th row of the input, it's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. In the output, the 9th row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So again, the 2 is moved down by one position. So, the pattern seems to be that each 2 in the input is shifted down by one row to the next available spot.\n\nBut wait, looking at the output, the 2s are only in certain rows. In the input, there are multiple 8s and a few 2s, but only two 2s in the output. So, only two 2s are moved down, and the rest remain where they are. That's interesting.\n\nNow, looking at Example 2. The input has a lot of 0s and 8s, and a single 2. In the output, the 2 is moved down from the 10th position to the 11th. So, similar to Example 1, the 2 is shifted down by one row.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a bunch of 8s and a single 2. The output has the 2 shifted down as well, except for the first few rows which remain unchanged. So, the same pattern seems to apply here.\n\nSo, the rule is: in the output grid, each 2 from the input grid that is located in a certain row is moved down by one row to the next available spot, provided that there's still a spot available. Any 2s that cannot be moved down are left as 2s in their original position.\n\nTherefore, to apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\nThe test input is a 16x16 grid with mostly zeros and a few 8s and a single 2. Let's identify the positions of the 2s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's identify the positions of the 2s. In the 8th row, the 2 is at column 15. In the 9th row, it's at column 16. Wait, but looking at the output grid, these positions are changed.\n\nWait, in the output, the 2s are in the same positions as they were in the test input? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, in the output grid, the 2s are in the same positions as the input? Wait, no, in Example 3, the 2 in the 8th row was shifted down, but in the output, it's still in the same position. Wait, no, the output has the 2 in column 15 and 16 for the 9th row. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me look at the output grid again.\n\nThe output grid for Example 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n\nLooking at the test input, I see that in the 8th row, there's a 2 at column 15, and in the 9th row, another 2 at column 16. Wait, but in the output grid, for example, the 9th row has a 2 at column 16, same as the input, while the 8th row's 2 is shifted down. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, in the test input, the 8th row is 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. The 2 is at column 15. In the output grid, the 8th row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0, so the 2 is now at column 9. That doesn't make sense because it should be shifted down. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the shift.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each 2 is moved down by one row, but if there's no spot below, it stays. So in the test input, the 8th row's 2 is at column 15. The output grid's 8th row's 2 is at column 9. That's actually moving it up, which contradicts the earlier examples. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are being moved down, but their positions are determined by some other rule, like their value or their position in the row. Alternatively, perhaps the 2s are being carried over from previous rows but moved down.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 3's input and output, I see that the 2 in the 8th row is at column 15, and in the output, the 2 is at column 9, which is above, not below. That suggests that the shift is the opposite direction. So maybe the rule is that 2s are moved up, not down. Or perhaps it's a typo in the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 2s are being moved down by one row, but in the test input, the 2 is in the 8th row and needs to be moved down to the 9th row, but in the output, it's in the 9th row. So that works. Similarly, the 2 in the 9th row needs to be moved down to the 10th row, which is also present. The 2 in the 10th row is already in the 10th row, so it remains. The 2 in the 11th row is shifted to the 12th row, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the output grid, the 9th row's 2 is at column 16, which is the same as the input, which doesn't make sense if it's shifted down. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting columns.\n\nWait, maybe the 2 in the test input is in column 15, which is the 16th column (since columns are 1-based). So shifting down by one would place it in column 16. But in the output, it's still in column 16. Wait, no, the output for the test input is the same as the input except the 2 is moved down. Wait, no, in the test input, the 2 is in the 8th row, column 15, and in the output, it's in the 9th row, column 16. So the 2 moved down by one row and column.\n\nWait, that matches the pattern from the other examples. So, the rule is: each 2 in the input grid is moved down by one row to the next available spot in the same column. Any 2s that cannot be moved down are left as is.\n\nTherefore, in the test input, the 2 in the 8th row, column 15, moves down to the 9th row, column 16. The 2 in the 9th row, column 16, moves down to the 10th row, column 17, and so on until it reaches the 16th row.\n\nWait, but in the output, the 2 in the 9th row is still in column 16, which suggests that it's not moving down. That contradicts the earlier observation. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being moved down, but only one position. So in the 8th row, the 2 moves to the 9th row. In the 9th row, the 2 moves to the 10th row, and so on. The 2 that was in the 8th row doesn't move further, but the 2 in the 9th row still moves to the 10th row.\n\nWait, but in the output grid, the 9th row's 2 is still in column 16, which is the same as the input. So that suggests that perhaps the 2s are only moving down one row, but the 8th row's 2 doesn't move, which doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being carried over, but not necessarily shifted down. Or perhaps the 2s are being moved down, but their positions are determined by the movement rules from previous examples.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the 2s are being shifted down by one row, but with a carry-over. For example, if a row has a 2, it might carry over to the next row, shifting down.\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 in row 8 and column 10 is shifted down to row 9 and column 10. The other 2s in row 10 are carried over, but in the output, they remain at column 10.\n\nIn Example 3, the 2 in row 8 and column 15 is shifted down to row 9 and column 16. The 2 in row 9 is shifted down to row 10 and column 16. The 2 in row 10 is shifted down to row 11 and column 16, and so on, until the 2 in row 15 is shifted down to row 16.\n\nWait, but in the test input, the 2 in row 8 and column 15 shifts down to row 9 and column 16. The 2 in row 9 and column 16 shifts down to row 10 and column 17. The 2 in row 10 and column 16 shifts down to row 11 and column 17. The 2 in row 11 and column 16 shifts down to row 12 and column 17. The 2 in row 12 and column 16 shifts down to row 13 and column 17. The 2 in row 13 and column 16 shifts down to row 14 and column 17. The 2 in row 14 and column 16 shifts down to row 15 and column 17. The 2 in row 15 and column 16 shifts down to row 16 and column 17.\n\nBut in the output, the 2 in row 8 is at column 15, which shifts down to column 16. The 2 in row 9 remains at column 16. The 2 in row 10 remains at column 16, but in the output, it's at column 16 as well. Wait, no, in the output, the 2 in row 10 is at column 16, same as the input.

So, looking at the examples provided, I need to compare the input and output grids to see if there's a consistent pattern or transformation happening.\n\nFirst, let's take Example 1:\n\nInput has a lot of zeros except for a few 2s and an 8 in the middle of the first row. The output grid has a 2 in the same position as the input, but other cells remain mostly zeros. Hmm, maybe the 2 is somehow indicating that a value is duplicated or something along those lines.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has multiple 8s and a 0 elsewhere, and the output seems to have 8s in certain positions and a 0 elsewhere. Wait, but looking more closely, the output seems to shift some 8s to the right. For instance, the first 8 in the input is in the first row, but in the output, it's shifted to the second row. Maybe the 8s are moving to the right as they go across the grid.\n\nLet's check Example 3. The input has an 8 in the top right and a 2 in the middle right. The output has a 2 in the middle right, which aligns with the input's 2. The 8s seem to stay in their positions, but the 2s are moving to the right, which is consistent with the output being shifted right by one cell.\n\nPutting it all together, it looks like the rule is that each row in the output is a shifted version of the corresponding row in the input, but with a shift to the right. Specifically, each row in the output is shifted one cell to the right compared to the input. For example, in Example 2, the first row in the input has an 8 which moves to the second row of the output, and so on.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 2 is in the middle of the first row. In the output, the 2 is in the middle of the second row, which is a shift. So, yes, it seems each row in the output is a right shift of the corresponding input row by one position.\n\nTo confirm, let's look at another example. In Example 3, the first row has an 8 which is in the first position. The output has an 8 in the first position of the second row. So again, a right shift by one.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that each row in the output is the same as the corresponding row in the input, but shifted one position to the right. That means the last element of each row moves to the first position of the next row.\n\nSo, to generate the output grid, for each input row, we take its elements, and the last element becomes the first element of the output row. The rest of the elements shift right by one. If the last element is on the last row, it wraps around to the first position.\n\nThis seems to be the consistent transformation across all examples provided.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid starts with a lot of zeros except for a few 8s. The output grid also has 8s but in specific positions. For instance, in the third row from the top, the middle 8 becomes 2, and the 8s around it become 0s. Similarly, the last 8 in the input grid turns into 8 in the output, but some others remain 8 or change to 0s.\n\nIn Example 2, I notice that some 8s in the input grid are replaced by 0s in the output. For example, the 8 in the 10th row (index 9) is turned into 0, and another 8 is turned into 8 again. This suggests that the transformation isn't uniform; it depends on certain conditions within each row.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output grid has 8s in some regions that match the 8s in the input, but again, certain regions change. For example, the 10th row in the input has an 8 that becomes 8 in the output, but another 8 becomes 0. This indicates that the transformation is row-dependent.\n\nI think the rule involves checking each cell and determining if it should stay the same or change based on its neighbors or positions. Perhaps cells that are 0 in the input might become 0 in the output unless they are surrounded by certain conditions, and cells that are 8 might either stay 8 or change based on their neighbors.\n\nLet me consider the position of each cell. For instance, in the third row from the top of Example 1, the middle cell becomes 2. This seems like it's influenced by some surrounding 8s. Maybe when a cell has adjacent 8s, it's changed to 2, otherwise, it remains 8 or becomes 0.\n\nLooking at the second example, the transformation is more complex. The 10th row's 8 becomes 0, which suggests that maybe when a cell is in a certain position relative to other 8s, it's turned into 0. I need to find a pattern.\n\nAnother approach is to look for cells that are 8 in the input and see what they become in the output. For example, in the 10th row of Example 1, the middle 8 becomes 2, while the 8s in the 10th column become 8 again. This suggests that only certain 8s are transformed.\n\nI think the rule is that in each row, cells that are 8 are turned into 0 if they are surrounded by certain conditions, otherwise, they remain 8 or become 2 in specific cases. Alternatively, cells that are 0 become 0 if they are not in a certain state, else they remain 0 or become 8.\n\nWait, looking at the third example, it seems that cells that are 0 in the input might become 0 in the output unless they are in a specific configuration. For instance, the last few rows in Example 3 show that some 8s become 0, and others stay as 8. This might indicate that a cell is 0 only if all its neighboring cells are 0 as well.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule seems to be that a cell remains 0 if all its adjacent cells are 0. If any adjacent cell is non-zero, it might change. Specifically, cells that are 8 in the input might become 2 in some cases, but in others, they stay as 8 or become 0. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that cells that are 8 in the input become 0 if they have adjacent 0s, otherwise, they stay as 8.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the middle 8 becomes 2, which suggests that when a cell is in a certain position relative to other 8s, it changes. Maybe if a 8 is in a position where it has adjacent 0s, it turns into 2. Otherwise, it remains 8 or becomes 0 based on other conditions.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, but I think the key is that each cell is checked, and based on its state and the states of its neighbors, it might stay the same or change. The transformation seems to be that certain 8s are replaced by 0s or 2s, while others remain the same.\n\nTo test this, I'll look for a pattern in the examples. For instance, in the third example, the last 8s turn into 8s, indicating that they don't change. The 2s in the output might be the result of the 8s in the input turning into 2s under certain conditions.\n\nOverall, the rule appears to involve checking the surrounding cells of each cell in the grid. If certain conditions are met (like having adjacent 0s or specific 8s), the cell's value changes. Otherwise, it remains the same.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully looking at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a grid with a lot of zeros and some 8s. The output grid starts with some zeros and then has a 2 somewhere, and then a lot of zeros again. I notice that in the input, the last row has an 8 followed by several zeros and then an 8 and a 2 in the middle. In the output, that 8 remains, but the 2 becomes a 2 in the same position, but wait, actually looking closer, the output seems to have a 2 only in the third row, and elsewhere, zeros are preserved.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at more detailed parts. Let's take a closer look at Example 1. The input has a 2 in the third row, sixth column. In the output, that same position is 2, but there's also a 2 in the seventh row, sixth column. Hmm, that suggests that the 2 is preserved, but other changes might be happening.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The input has an 8 in the seventh row, sixth column, and an 8 in the eighth row, sixth column. In the output, both these 8s remain, but maybe somewhere else, a 2 appears. Let me check the output again. Oh, in the output, the seventh row, sixth column is 2, and the eighth row, sixth column is 2. So perhaps the 2s are being moved or preserved in certain positions.\n\nBut in the output, the first row is all zeros. So maybe the rule is to set a 2 in certain positions based on some condition.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input grid seems to have 8s in the last few rows and some zeros. The output has 8s in the last few rows, some with a 2 in the middle. It looks like wherever there's an 8 in the input, it remains in the output. But wait, in the input, there are 8s in the last few rows, but in the output, those 8s are still 8s. So perhaps the 2s are being set in certain positions.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has 8s in the last few rows, and the output shows 8s in the same positions. So maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input remains 8 in the output. What about the 2s? In the output, some 2s are preserved, but it's not clear where.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 2s in certain positions, and the output also has 2s in the same places, but also has 8s in some other positions. So perhaps the rule is that any 0s become 0s, any 8s become 8s, and the 2s are preserved in their positions.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has some 2s, but in the input, the 2 is in the third row, sixth column, and in the output, it's the same. So maybe the 2s are being preserved in their positions, but other changes are happening.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes a 2 in the output, and any 2 in the input becomes a 2 in the output, while 0s remain 0s. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has an 8 in the seventh row, sixth column, and an 8 in the eighth row, sixth column. The output has 2s in the same positions, so that fits. Also, in the output, the last few rows have 8s, which were present in the input, so that also fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s in the last few rows, and the output has 8s in those positions, so that fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 0s and 2s, and the output has 0s and 2s in the same positions, so that fits.\n\nWait, but in the output of Example 3, the first row is all 0s, which matches the input. The second row has a 2 in the last column, which matches the input's 2 in the last column. The third row has 0s except for a 2 in the first column, which matches the input's 2. So this seems consistent.\n\nSo the rule is: for each cell, if the input has an 8, output a 2; if the input already has a 2, output a 2; if the input is 0, output 0. Otherwise, output the same as input.\n\nTherefore, the rule is to replace each 8 with a 2, leave 2s as they are, and leave 0s as they are.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Looking at the examples provided will help me understand what's happening.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and a single 2 in the middle row. The output shows that the 2 remains in the middle, but the surrounding zeros remain the same. However, in the last few lines, there are numbers like 8 and 0, which don't seem to change. Maybe the rule isn't about just keeping the 2 in place but something more specific.\n\nLooking at Example 2, I notice that in the input, one of the rows has a 3 in the middle and also a 3 in the 8th position. The output for that particular row is two 3s followed by some 1s and 8s. It seems like the 3s are being duplicated. Maybe whenever a 3 appears in a row, it stays the same, but if there's an 8, it becomes 1s around it.\n\nIn Example 3, there's a row with a 5 in the middle, and the output for that row has multiple 5s. It looks like 5s are not changing, but other numbers like 8s might be involved. If the input has an 8, the output might have 5s around it.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the rule is: for each cell, if the input is 0, it stays 0. If it's a 3, it stays 3. If it's an 8, it stays 8. If it's a 5, it stays 5. But wait, in Example 2, the output for the row with 8 has some 1s. Maybe when 8 is next to another number, it becomes 1s.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each cell in the output, if the input cell is 0, 3, 5, or 8, it remains the same. If it's another number, like 7 or 9, it becomes 1s. But I'm not sure if that's the case because in the examples, the only changes are in the 3s and 8s.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the row with 3 remains as 3, and the rows with 8 become 1s and 8s. So maybe whenever a 3 or 8 appears, it stays, but perhaps neighboring numbers turn into 1s. Or maybe 8 becomes 1 when adjacent to another number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 3s and 8s are transformed into 5s and 1s. But in the output, the 3 remains, and the 8 becomes 1s. Maybe the 8 is being replaced by 1s only.\n\nSo, the rule could be: any 0 remains 0. Any 3 remains 3. Any 8 remains 8. And any other numbers (like 7, 9, etc.) become 1s. Or perhaps only 8 becomes 1, and others stay the same.\n\nLooking back at the examples, in the output, the 3s stay as 3s, and the 8s become 1s. So maybe the rule is that 3s and 8s are left unchanged, while other numbers (including 0) stay the same. But that doesn't fit because in the input, there are zeros, and they stay as zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 0s stay as 0s, 3s stay as 3s, and 8s stay as 8s, while other numbers (like 5, 7, etc.) might be transformed. But in Example 2, the outputs have 1s where 8s are, which doesn't align with 0s remaining as 0s.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the row that originally had an 8 became 1s in the output. So maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes 1 in the output. Also, any 3 remains 3. Zero remains zero. But in the first example, the 2 was in the middle and stayed there. So perhaps 2s are also left as 2s.\n\nSo, the rule could be: for each cell, if it's 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, or 1, it stays the same. If it's another number, like 4, 6, etc., it becomes 1. But in the examples, the 8 becomes 1, and the 2 remains 2. So perhaps 8 becomes 1, and any other number becomes 1 if it's not 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 8.\n\nBut in the output in Example 1, the 2 remains as 2, which aligns with that rule. The 8 becomes 1, which also aligns. The 3 remains as 3. The 0 remains as 0. Other numbers like 4, 6, etc., become 1.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the 8 becomes 1, but the 0s stay as 0s. So perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes 1 in the output, while other numbers remain the same.\n\nPutting this together, the rule is:\n\n- For each cell, if the value is 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, or 1, it remains the same.\n- If the value is 4, 6, or 9, it changes to 1.\n\nBut in the examples, the 8 becomes 1, which fits. The 3 remains 3. The 0 remains 0.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the test input grid:\n\nLooking at the input, I'll need to go through each cell and apply this rule. For example, if a cell is 0, it stays 0. If it's 8, it becomes 1. Any other number becomes 1.\n\nLet me apply this to the test input:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- All 0s stay 0.\n- The row with 7 becomes 1 where 7 is, so the 7 becomes 1s in the surrounding cells.\n- The row with 6 becomes 1 where 6 is, so the 6 becomes 1s in the surrounding cells.\n\nWait, but according to the rule, any number other than 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, or 1 becomes 1. So, 0s, 2s, 3s, 5s, 7s, 8s, and 1s stay the same. All other numbers (like 4, 6, 9) become 1.\n\nSo, in the test input, the 7 becomes 1, the 6 becomes 1, and the 8 becomes 1. All other cells (0) stay 0.\n\nThus, the output grid would have the 7 turned into 1 in all surrounding cells, the 6 turned into 1, and the 8 turned into 1.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the 8 becomes 1, and other numbers become 1 if they are not 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, or 1.\n\nSo, the rule is: any 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, or 1 remains the same. All other numbers are replaced with 1.\n\nNow, let's apply this to each cell in the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nFirst row: all 0s, so output remains all 0s.\n\nSecond row: has a 7. So the 7 becomes 1 in all surrounding cells. But wait, the 7 is in the second row, fifth column. So in the surrounding cells, the 1s will be placed where the 7 was. So the 7 becomes 1s in the cells around it.\n\nSimilarly, the 6 in the 8th row (row 8) becomes 1 in all surrounding cells.\n\nThe 8 in the 16th row (row 16) becomes 1 in all surrounding cells.\n\nSo, in the output grid, the 7, 6, and 8 become 1s in their respective areas, while all other cells remain 0.\n\nTherefore, the output grid will be:\n\nAll 0s except for the areas around the 7, 6, and 8, which become 1s.\n\nSo, in the first part of the output, the 7 in row 1, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 0-1, columns 4-6. Similarly, the 7 in row 2, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 1-2, columns 4-6. Wait, but in the input, the row is 0-based or 1-based?\n\nWait, the test input's second row is index 1, so in the output, the 7 in row 1, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 0-1, columns 4-6.\n\nSimilarly, the 7 in row 2, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 1-2, columns 4-6.\n\nThe 7 in row 3, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 2-3, columns 4-6.\n\nThe 7 in row 4, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 3-4, columns 4-6.\n\nThe 6 in row 7 (index 7), column 5 becomes 1 in rows 6-7, columns 4-6.\n\nThe 6 in row 8 (index 8), column 5 becomes 1 in rows 7-8, columns 4-6.\n\nThe 8 in row 15 (index 15), column 5 becomes 1 in rows 14-15, columns 4-6.\n\nAdditionally, the 7 in row 1, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 0-1, columns 4-6.\n\nSimilarly, the 7 in row 2, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 1-2, columns 4-6.\n\nThe 7 in row 3, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 2-3, columns 4-6.\n\nThe 7 in row 4, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 3-4, columns 4-6.\n\nThe 6 in row 7, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 6-7, columns 4-6.\n\nThe 6 in row 8, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 7-8, columns 4-6.\n\nThe 8 in row 15, column 5 becomes 1 in rows 14-15, columns 4-6.\n\nAdditionally, there's a 6 in row 8, column 0, which becomes 1 in all surrounding cells.\n\nSo, putting all these together, the output grid will have a 1 in all surrounding cells of the original 7, 6, and 8, while the rest remain 0.\n\nSo, the final output grid will look like:\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, looking at the examples provided, I'll start by comparing the input and output grids to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nIn the first example, the input grid has some zeros and an 8 in the fourth row. The output grid shows that the 8 in the fourth row becomes two 2s in the fifth and sixth rows. The rest of the rows remain mostly zeros. Hmm, that seems like a pattern where if there's a non-zero number, it might be expanding or being transformed in some way.\n\nIn the second example, there's an 8 in the fourth row, and in the output, that 8 turns into two 3s in the fifth and sixth rows. Also, other zeros and 3s are present. So, it looks like the non-zero numbers are being doubled or transformed in a specific way.\n\nLooking at the third example, there's a 5 and an 8 in the sixth row. In the output, the 8 becomes two 8s, and the 5 becomes two 5s. The 5s also turn into 8s in the later rows. This suggests that non-zero numbers are being scaled up.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the rule is: for each non-zero number in the input, it's either doubled or scaled up in some manner to create the corresponding number in the output grid. Specifically, in the examples, it's doubling the number, except maybe for the 5 becoming 8. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nIn the third example, the 5 in the sixth row becomes two 5s in the seventh and eighth rows, but in the output, it's transformed into two 8s. That doesn't match. Wait, perhaps it's not exactly doubling. Let me look at the numbers again.\n\nWait, in the third example, the input has a 5 in the sixth row and an 8. The output has two 5s in the seventh row and two 8s in the eighth row. So, it seems like the 5 becomes two 5s, and the 8 remains as two 8s. But that's not consistent with the first example.\n\nIn the first example, the 8 in the fourth row becomes two 2s in the fifth and sixth rows. So, maybe the number is being halved. Let me check that.\n\nYes, in the first example, 8 in the fourth row becomes 2 in the fifth and sixth rows. Similarly, the 3 in the fourth row of the second example becomes two 1.5s, but wait, the output grid has 3s and 1s. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being halved when they are non-zero, but that doesn't explain the 8 turning into two 8s. Wait, perhaps the rule is more complex. Maybe it's based on the position or the value in a different way.\n\nLooking at the third example, the 5 in the sixth row becomes two 5s in the seventh and eighth rows. The 8 becomes two 8s. Wait, but in the third example, the 5 in the sixth row is in a different position than the 8. Maybe it's being duplicated or scaled up in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number in the input grid will be duplicated in the output grid at the same position. But that doesn't explain why the 8 in the first example becomes two 2s. Unless it's being replaced by something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each non-zero number, it's replaced by a pair of the same number, but scaled by a certain factor. For example, the 8 in the first example becomes two 2s, which is a factor of 0.5. Similarly, the 5 in the third example becomes two 8s, which is a factor of 1.6. That doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each non-zero number in the input grid, it's replaced by a pair of its value in the output grid. So, if the input has a 3, the output has two 1.5s. But in the examples, the outputs have integers, so that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number in the input grid is replaced by the same number in the output grid, but scaled by a factor. For example, 8 becomes two 4s, but in the first example, it's two 2s. So, 8 becomes two 4s, but in the first example, it's two 2s. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that non-zero numbers are replaced by their half in the output. So, 8 becomes 4, but in the first example, it becomes 2. Hmm, that also doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the non-zero numbers are doubled, except when they are 5, which becomes 8. That seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, let me think again. In the first example, the 8 in the fourth row becomes two 2s in the fifth and sixth rows. That suggests that 8 is being halved. Similarly, in the third example, the 5 becomes two 5s, and the 8 becomes two 8s. So, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by the same number in the output grid, but only if it's a multiple of 5, it becomes 8. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each non-zero number in the input, it's replaced by two copies of itself in the output, but scaled by a factor of 0.5. So, 8 becomes 4, but in the first example, it becomes 2. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number in the input is replaced by two copies of itself in the output, but only if it's a multiple of 3, it's replaced by 1.5. But in the first example, 8 becomes 2, which isn't a multiple of 3. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the non-zero numbers are being scaled by a factor of 0.5, but then 8 becomes 4, but in the first example, it's 2. So, perhaps the rule is that 8 becomes two 4s, but in the first example, the 2s are showing up, which suggests that the rule is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the second example again. The input has an 8 in the fourth row, and the output has two 3s in the fifth and sixth rows. So, 8 becomes two 3s. That suggests that 8 is being halved to 4, but perhaps it's being replaced by two 3s. That doesn't fit the 0.5 scaling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by the same number in the output, but only if it's 3, it's replaced by 3, if it's 5, it's replaced by 5, but in the first example, 8 is replaced by 2, which is a different scaling.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the non-zero numbers are being replaced by the same number in the output, but the scaling factor depends on the position. For example, in the first example, the 8 is in the fourth row, and it's replaced by two 2s in the fifth and sixth rows. So, 8 becomes 2, which is a factor of 0.5. Similarly, perhaps in the third example, the 5 in the sixth row becomes two 5s, and the 8 in the seventh row becomes two 8s. So, the rule is that non-zero numbers are replaced by two copies of themselves multiplied by 0.5.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the 8 becomes two 3s. So, 8 * 0.5 is 4, but in the output, it's two 3s. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that non-zero numbers are replaced by themselves if they are even, and half if they are odd. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by two copies of itself divided by 2. So, 8 becomes two 4s, but in the first example, it's 2, which suggests that it's not consistent.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the non-zero numbers are scaled by a factor of 0.5 if they are even, and by 1.5 if they are odd, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each non-zero number, it's replaced by two copies of itself if the number is 3, 5, or 8, and by itself multiplied by 0.5 otherwise. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by the same number in the output, but if the number is even, it's divided by 2, and if it's odd, it's replaced by itself multiplied by 1.5. Let's test that.\n\nIn the first example, 8 is even, so it becomes 4. But in the output, it's 2, which doesn't fit. So, that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by two copies of itself if the number is a multiple of 3, and by itself multiplied by 0.5 otherwise. Let's see.\n\nIn the first example, 8 is not a multiple of 3, so it's replaced by two 4s, but in the output, it's two 2s. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the non-zero numbers are being scaled by a factor of 0.5, but only if the number is 4 or 6, and scaled by 0.5 otherwise. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the non-zero numbers are being replaced by the same number in the output, but the scaling factor depends on the position. For example, in the first example, the 8 in the fourth row becomes two 2s in the fifth and sixth rows. The 3 in the fourth row becomes two 1.5s, but in the output, it's 1.5s as 1 and 0.5. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each non-zero number, it's replaced by two copies of itself divided by 2. So, 8 becomes two 4s. But in the first example, it's 2, which suggests that the scaling factor is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the non-zero numbers are being scaled by a factor of 0.5, but then 8 becomes 4, which is not shown in the first example. So, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should look at the patterns in the rows and see if there's a consistent transformation happening.\n\nIn the first example, the fourth row has an 8, and the fifth and sixth rows have 2s. The rest of the rows remain zeros. In the second example, the fourth row has an 8, and the fifth and sixth rows have 3s. The rest of the rows are zeros. In the third example, the fourth row has a 5, and the seventh and eighth rows have 5s. The sixth row has an 8, and the seventh and eighth rows have 8s.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number in the fourth row becomes two copies in the fifth and sixth rows, regardless of the value. Similarly, in the seventh row, any non-zero number becomes two copies in the eighth and ninth rows. In the sixth row, any non-zero number becomes two copies in the seventh and eighth rows.\n\nIn the first example, the fourth row has an 8, so it becomes two 2s in rows five and six. The seventh row has a 5, so it becomes two 5s in rows eight and nine. The sixth row has a 0, so it remains zero.\n\nIn the second example, the fourth row has an 8, so it becomes two 3s in rows five and six. The seventh row has a 5, so it becomes two 5s in rows eight and nine. The fourth row doesn't have a non-zero number in row six, so it remains zero.\n\nIn the third example, the fourth row has a 5, so it becomes two 5s in rows seven and eight. The seventh row has an 8, so it becomes two 8s in rows six and seven. The sixth row has a 0, so it remains zero.\n\nWait, but in the third example, the seventh row's 8 becomes two 8s in the sixth and seventh rows, which is a bit inconsistent with the previous examples. So, perhaps the rule is that in the fourth row, each non-zero number is replaced by two copies in the fifth and sixth rows. In the seventh row, each non-zero number is replaced by two copies in the eighth and ninth rows. In the sixth row, each non-zero number is replaced by two copies in the seventh and eighth rows.\n\nThat seems to fit the examples. So, for each non-zero number in the fourth row, it's duplicated in the fifth and sixth rows. For each non-zero number in the seventh row, it's duplicated in the eighth and ninth rows. For each non-zero number in the sixth row, it's duplicated in the seventh and eighth rows.\n\nIn the first example, the fourth row's 8 becomes two 2s in rows five and six. The seventh row's 5 becomes two 5s in rows eight and nine. The sixth row's 0 remains zero.\n\nIn the second example, the fourth row's 8 becomes two 3s in rows five and six. The seventh row's 5 becomes two 5s in rows eight and nine. The fourth row's 0 remains zero.\n\nIn the third example, the fourth row's 5 becomes two 5s in rows seven and eight. The seventh row's 8 becomes two 8s in rows six and seven. The sixth row's 0 remains zero.\n\nSo, this seems to be the pattern. Therefore, the rule is:\n\n- In the fourth row, each non-zero number is duplicated in the fifth and sixth rows.\n- In the seventh row, each non-zero number is duplicated in the eighth and ninth rows.\n- In the sixth row, each non-zero number is duplicated in the seventh and eighth rows.\n\nIf there are no non-zero numbers in a row, the output remains zero in those rows.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the second example where the fourth row has an 8, the fifth and sixth rows will have two 3s each, and the seventh and eighth rows will have two 1.5s, but since the output has integers, perhaps it's rounded or scaled differently. However, in the output, it's 1 and 0, which suggests that maybe some scaling happened.\n\nWait, in the second example, the fourth row's 8 becomes two 3s in rows five and six. The seventh and eighth rows have 1s and 0s. So, perhaps the rule is that the non-zero numbers in these rows are scaled by 0.5, turning 8 into 4, but in the output, it's 3. That doesn't fit. Or perhaps it's rounding down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in the fourth row, non-zero numbers are replaced by two copies in the fifth and sixth rows, but scaled by 0.5. So, 8 becomes 4, but in the output, it's 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in the fourth row, non-zero numbers are replaced by two copies in the fifth and sixth rows, but scaled by 0.5. So, 8 becomes 4, but in the output, it's 2. That suggests that the scaling factor is 0.5 only when the number is even. Wait, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the non-zero numbers are replaced by two copies in the fifth and sixth rows, but scaled by 0.5. So, 8 becomes 4 in the fifth and sixth rows, but in the output, it's 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the non-zero numbers are replaced by two copies in the fifth and sixth rows, but scaled by 0.5 and then floored. So, 8 becomes 4, but in the output, it's 2, which suggests that 4 is being halved again.\n\nBut that seems convoluted. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the non-zero numbers are replaced by two copies in the fifth and sixth rows, but scaled by 0.5, and if the result is less than 1, it's set to 0. So, 8 becomes 4, but in the output, it's 2, which suggests that it's being halved again.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the non-zero numbers are replaced by two copies in the fifth and sixth rows, each scaled by 0.5. So, 8 becomes two 4s, but in the output, it's 2, which suggests that the 4s are then being halved again. But that would require multiple transformations, which is not reflected in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the non-zero numbers are replaced by two copies in the fifth and sixth rows, each scaled by 0.5, but with any number less than 1 being set to 0. So, 8 becomes two 4s, but since 4 is greater than 1, it remains 4. But in the output, it's 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the non-zero numbers are replaced by two copies in the fifth and sixth rows, and then the entire row is scaled by 0.5. So, 8 becomes two 4s, and then scaled to 2 in the output. That would fit the first example.\n\nIn the second example, the fourth row's 8 becomes two 4s in the fifth and sixth rows, and then scaled to 2. So, the output has 2s. That fits.\n\nIn the third example, the fourth row's 5 becomes two 4s in the fifth and sixth rows, but in the output, it's 5s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, so perhaps the rule is that each non-zero number is replaced by two copies in the fifth and sixth rows, and then the entire row is scaled by 0.5. So, 8 becomes two 4s, which are then scaled to 2, matching the first example. Similarly, in the second example, 8 becomes two 4s, scaled to 2. In the third example, 5 becomes two 4s, which are then scaled to 2, but in the output, they remain ", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are two examples provided, and then there's a test input grid that I need to predict. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at example 1, the input has a lot of zeros except for a 2 in the middle row and a 6 in a specific position in another row. The output shows that the 2 becomes 2, but the 6 in the output is something else\u2014wait, no, in the output of example 1, the 6 seems to be transformed into 8. Also, the 6 in the input becomes 8 in the output. So maybe the rule is to replace 2s with 2s and 6s with 8s. But let me check other examples to confirm.\n\nIn example 2, the input has a 3 in the middle of a row, and the output has the same 3. Wait, no, looking again, the output's middle row has a 3, a 0, and an 1. Hmm, maybe not. Let me see. The input has a 3 in the 7th row, and the output has a 3 in the 5th row. So perhaps the rule is that any number 3 or higher in the input becomes a 3 in the output, but in the test case, it's 6 that becomes 8, so that might fit.\n\nWait, in example 1, the 3 in the input becomes a 3 in the output, but in example 2, the 3 becomes a 0. So that can't be it. Maybe it's about the values after certain operations. Let me look at example 3.\n\nIn example 3, the input has a 5 in the fifth row, and the output also has a 5. Wait, no, the fifth row in the input isn't 5; the fifth row of the input has a 5 in the last column. The output has a 5 in the fifth column as well. But in the output of example 3, the fifth row has 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, which seems like it's the same as the input for 5. Hmm, maybe the rule is to replace 5 with 5 and 8 with 8, but that doesn't explain the 3 becoming 0.\n\nWait, let me go back to example 2. The input has a 3 in the 7th row, and the output has 3, 0, and 1. So the 3 remains 3, which suggests that maybe numbers above a certain threshold don't change. But in example 1, the 3 doesn't appear, but the 2 and 6 change.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of non-zero elements or something else. But that doesn't seem to fit because in example 1, the 6 becomes 8, which is a different number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about considering the input as a grid and interpreting it in a certain way, like the sum of the row or column, or the maximum value. Let me think about example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the input has a 2 in the second row, and the output has the same 2 in that row. In the fifth row, the input has a 6, and the output has two 8s and a 0. Wait, maybe the rule is to replace 2 with 2 and 6 with 8, but also, in the other rows, the 0s stay 0, and other numbers stay the same. Let me check example 2.\n\nIn example 2, the 3 in the 7th row of the input becomes 3 in the output. So that suggests that the 3 remains 3, but maybe in other rows, numbers are reduced. Wait, in example 3, the 5 in the fifth row and the 8 in the sixth row of the input become 5 and 8 in the output, so that might not be the case.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to consider the maximum value per row or per column. Let me think. In example 1, the first row has a 0, the second row has a 2, and the sixth row has a 6. The output shows that the 2 remains 2, and the 6 becomes 8. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number in the input is replaced by 2 or 8. But that doesn't fit because in example 2, the 3 becomes 0, which would suggest that 3s are replaced with 0, but 6 becomes 8, which is consistent.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace numbers less than 3 with 0, numbers between 3 and 6 with 2, and numbers greater than or equal to 8 with 8. But in example 1, the 2 would become 2, the 6 becomes 8, and the 8 remains 8. In example 2, the 3 becomes 0, and the 6 becomes 8. That seems to fit.\n\nLet me test this idea with example 3. The input has a 5 in the fifth row, which is between 3 and 6, so it should become 2. But in the output, it's 5, which doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is different. Let me think again. In example 2, the input has a 3 in the 7th row, and the output has a 3 in the 5th row. So maybe the rule is that any number in the input that is greater than or equal to 3 remains the same, but in the output, it's replaced with 0. Wait, but then in example 1, the 6 becomes 8, which is a different number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is about the parity of the number. Even numbers remain even, odd numbers become odd. But 2 is even, 6 is even, and they remain even. The 3 in example 2 becomes 0, which is even, but 3 is odd. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the value after a certain operation. For example, 2 becomes 2, 3 becomes 0, 6 becomes 8, and 8 remains 8. So perhaps the rule is to replace 2 with 2, 3 with 0, 6 with 8, and leave 8 as is. But in example 1, the 6 becomes 8, which fits, but what about other numbers?\n\nLooking at example 3, the 5 in the fifth row becomes 5, which would fit if the rule is to replace 5 with 5 and 8 with 8, but that doesn't explain why in example 2, the 3 becomes 0.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is about the presence of a certain value. For example, any 2 remains 2, any 3 becomes 0, any 6 becomes 8, and any 8 remains 8. Then, in example 1, the 6 becomes 8, which fits. In example 2, the 3 becomes 0, which fits. In example 3, the 5 remains 5, and the 8 remains 8, which fits.\n\nLet me test this with another example. Suppose I have a grid where there's a 4. According to this rule, 4 should remain 4. If there's a 5, it remains 5. If there's a 6, it becomes 8. If there's an 8, it remains 8.\n\nWait, but in example 1, the 8 in the output is in the last row, which is a different position. That might indicate that the rule is not based on the values of the cells but on their positions. Or perhaps it's about the count of certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any cell with a value greater than or equal to 3 in the input becomes 2 in the output, and any cell with a value of 8 becomes 8, but leaves 3 and 6 as is. But that doesn't fit with example 2, where the 3 becomes 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any number in the input is replaced by 2 if it's 2, 3, or 6, and replaced by 0 if it's 3 or 6, and replaced by 8 if it's 8. Wait, that could explain the examples.\n\nWait, in example 1, the input has a 2 in the second row, which becomes 2, and a 6 in the last row, which becomes 8. In example 2, the input has a 3 in the 7th row, which becomes 0, and a 6 in the 7th row (wait, no, the 7th row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, so maybe I'm miscounting). Wait, in example 2, the input has a 3 in the 7th row, and the output has the same 3 in the 5th row. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced with 2 for 2, 3, and 6, and replaced with 0 for 3 and 6, and left as is for 2 and 8. But that doesn't fit with the 8 in the output being different.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to summarize:\n\n- In example 1, the 2 becomes 2, and the 6 becomes 8.\n- In example 2, the 3 becomes 0, and the 6 becomes 8.\n- In example 3, the 5 remains 5, and the 8 remains 8.\n\nSo the possible rule is:\n\n- Replace 2 with 2.\n- Replace 3 with 0.\n- Replace 6 with 8.\n- Replace 8 with 8.\n- Leave other numbers (like 4, 5, etc.) as is.\n\nBut let me check if that makes sense. If I apply that rule to example 1, the 2 remains 2, the 6 becomes 8, which fits. In example 2, the 3 becomes 0, the 6 becomes 8, which fits. In example 3, the 5 remains 5, the 8 remains 8, which fits.\n\nWait, but what about a number like 4? According to this rule, it would remain 4. In example 1, there's no 4, so that's fine. In example 2, there's no 4, so that's fine. In example 3, there's a 5 and an 8, which remain the same.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about another test case. Suppose I have a grid with a 4. According to the rule, it should remain 4. If I have a 5, it remains 5. If I have an 8, it remains 8. But in example 1, the 8 in the output is in the last row, which is a different position than the 6 in the input. Maybe that's because the rule is based on the count of certain values, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about the maximum value per row or column. For example, in example 1, the maximum in the last row is 8, which becomes 8. In example 2, the maximum in the 5th row is 8, which becomes 8. In example 3, the 5th row has 5, which remains 5, and the 8th row has 8, which remains 8.\n\nBut then, what about a 4 in example 3? According to this rule, it would remain 4, but in example 1, there's no 4, so it's fine.\n\nWait, but in example 3, the 5th row has a 5, which remains 5, and the 8th row has an 8, which remains 8. That fits.\n\nSo, based on these observations, the rule seems to be:\n\n- Any 2 remains 2.\n- Any 3 becomes 0.\n- Any 6 becomes 8.\n- Any 8 remains 8.\n- Any other number (like 4, 5, 7, etc.) remains unchanged.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the test input grid, I can replace 2s with 2s, 3s with 0s, 6s with 8s, and 8s with 8s, leaving other numbers as they are.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples given are quite detailed, so I need to figure out what transformation is happening.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the input and output grids. Let's start with the first example. The input has a bunch of zeros except for a 2 in the middle row and another 8 in the last row. The output grid has a zero in the first two rows, a 2 in the middle, and a 8 in the last row of the same positions. Wait, actually, looking closer, the middle row in the output has a 2 in the middle, but the last row has an 8. Hmm, that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, no, in the first example, the input's last row is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0], and the output's corresponding row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Oh, so the 8 in the last position turns into nothing. That suggests that the 8 is being removed or set to zero.\n\nNow, looking at another example, the second one. The input has a 3 in the last row, and the output's corresponding row has a 3 and a 1. Wait, no, the output row after 3 becomes 0 in the middle and 1 at the end. So it's not just zeroing out the 8. Maybe it's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the third example. The input has a 5 in a row that's supposed to become a 5 in the output, but in the output, that row is [0,0,0,0,5,5,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0], so the 5 is in the middle. Similarly, another 5 becomes 0 in the middle. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the 5 is being zeroed out, but the 8 remains.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about finding the maximum value in a region and using that to determine the output. For example, in the first example, the 8 is the maximum in its row, and it's being set to zero. Similarly, in the second example, maybe the 3 is the maximum in its row, and it's being set to zero, and the 1 is also a maximum elsewhere.\n\nWait, in the second example, the input has a 3 in the last row, and the output's corresponding row has a 3 and a 1. So perhaps the 3 is the maximum, and it's being set to zero, and the 1 is also a maximum elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the 3 is being reduced to zero, and the 1 is being set to zero as well.\n\nWait, looking at the third example, the 5 is the maximum in its row, and it's being set to zero. Similarly, the 8 is also a maximum, but it's remaining. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero element is zeroed out, and the maximum value in the row is kept as is.\n\nWait, let me test this idea. In the first example, the last row has an 8, which is the maximum. So in the output, it's set to zero, and the 2 remains. That fits. In the second example, the last row has a 3, which is the maximum, so it's set to zero, and the 1 is also a maximum elsewhere, but maybe it's being set to zero as well.\n\nWait, in the second example, the last row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the output's corresponding row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, no, in the second example, the input's last row has a 3, and the output's corresponding row has 3 and 1. So maybe the 3 is being set to zero, and the 1 is also being set to zero. Or perhaps only the maximum is kept, and others are set to zero.\n\nWait, in the first example, the output's last row is all zeros except for the 8, which is also the maximum in the row. So that fits the idea that the maximum remains, others are zeroed. In the second example, the last row has a 3, which is the maximum, so it's set to zero. The 1 is also a maximum elsewhere, so it's set to zero as well.\n\nWait, but in the third example, the 5 is the maximum in its row, so it's set to zero, and the 8 remains. So the rule seems to be: for each row, find the maximum value, then in the output, all elements that are not the maximum are set to zero, and the maximum is kept as is.\n\nWait, but in the third example, the 5 is the maximum, but the output shows 5 in the middle, which suggests that it's not being zeroed. Wait, no, the third example's output has a 5 in the middle, which was originally 5, so that's consistent with the rule. The 8 is the maximum but remains as is.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the output's last row has a 3 and a 1. So the maximum in that row is 3, and the 1 is set to zero. So the rule is: in each row, find the maximum value, and in the output, set all other elements to zero, keeping the maximum as is.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the input's last row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the output's corresponding row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, no, the output's last row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that can't be right because the input had a 3 and a 1, and the output has 0 and 1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again. The second example's input has a 3 in the last position, and the output has 0 and 1. So perhaps the 3 is being replaced by 1, which is the sum of the maximum and the minimum. Or maybe it's about the sum of the maximum and minimum values in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that in each row, the maximum value is kept, and all other elements are set to zero, but the maximum is also added to the sum of the zeros. Or perhaps it's about the maximum and minimum values.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the input's last row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output's corresponding row has a 3 and a 1. So the 3 must have been the maximum, and the 1 is being set to zero. So perhaps the rule is that the maximum value is kept, and all other elements are set to zero.\n\nBut then, in the third example, the 5 is the maximum, and it's kept, but the 8 is also the maximum. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the 8 is the maximum, and it's set to zero. The 2 is the maximum, but it remains. Wait, no, the first example's input's last row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the output's corresponding row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no, in the first example, the input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n... and so on until the last row, which is [0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output's corresponding row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 8 in the last row is being set to zero, but the other elements in that row are zero, so they remain.\n\nWait, so in this case, the 8 is the maximum, and it's being set to zero, while other zeros remain.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the 3 is the maximum, and it's being set to zero, while the 1 is also a maximum elsewhere, so it's being set to zero as well.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: for each row, find the maximum value, and in the output row, set all elements to zero except for the maximum, which is kept as is.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the output's last row has a 3 and a 1. If the maximum is 3, it's kept, and the 1 is set to zero. So the rule is, in each row, find the maximum value, and in the output row, set all elements to zero except for the maximum, which remains.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the 8 is the maximum, and it's set to zero, while the other zeros remain. So that fits.\n\nIn the third example, the 5 is the maximum, and it's kept as is, while the 8 is also a maximum but remains as is. Wait, no, in the third example, the 8 is the maximum, and it's kept as is, while the 5 is also a maximum and remains as is.\n\nWait, but in the third example, the input's last row has a 5, which is the maximum, and it's kept as is. So the rule is: find the maximum value in the row, and in the output, set all elements to zero except for the maximum, which remains.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the 1 is also a maximum elsewhere, so it's being set to zero. So the rule is that any element that is not the maximum is set to zero, and the maximum is kept.\n\nWait, but in the third example, the 5 is the maximum, so it's kept, and the 8 is the maximum, so it's kept as well. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the 8 is the maximum, so it's set to zero, while the other zeros remain.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the output's last row has a 3 and a 1, which suggests that the maximum is 3, and the 1 is being set to zero. So the rule is to keep the maximum and set others to zero.\n\nSo, to summarize, the rule is to find the maximum value in each row of the input grid. Then, in the output grid, set all elements to zero, and keep the maximum value from the input as is.\n\nBut wait, in the third example, the input's first row has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], so the maximum is zero. So in the output, it remains zero.\n\nIn the fourth example, the input's last row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], so maximum is zero, and output remains zero.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the input's last row has a 3, which is the maximum, so it's kept, and the 1 is set to zero.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row, find the maximum value, and set all elements except the maximum to zero. If the maximum is zero, it remains as zero.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the maximum is 8, so it's set to zero, and the rest are zero.\n\nIn the second example, the maximum is 3, so it's set to zero, and the 1 is set to zero as well.\n\nIn the third example, the maximum is 5, so it's set to zero, and 8 is also set to zero, but wait, in the third example, the 8 is the maximum and remains as is. Wait, that contradicts the rule.\n\nWait, no, in the third example, the input's last row is [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], and the maximum is 5, so it's set to zero, and the 8 is not present in this row. Wait, but in the third example's output, the last row has a 5 in the middle, which was originally 5, so it's kept. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the input's last row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and the output's corresponding row has a 3 and a 1. Wait, that can't be right because the maximum in that row is zero. So how does the output have 3 and 1?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rule. Maybe the rule is that in each row, the maximum value is kept, and all other elements are set to zero. So if all elements are zero, the output is all zeros. If there's a non-zero element, that's replaced by the maximum.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the input's last row has a 3, so the output's corresponding row should have 3 and zeros elsewhere, but in the output, it's [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, that can't be right because the 3 is not present.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the maximum value in each row is kept, and all other elements are set to zero. But in the second example, the input's last row has a single 3, so the output's corresponding row should have 3 and zeros elsewhere. But in the output, it's [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which seems incorrect. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that in each row, the maximum value is kept, and all other elements are set to zero. So if there's a non-zero value, it's replaced by the maximum. If all are zero, they remain zero.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the input's last row has a 3, so the output's corresponding row should have 3 and zeros elsewhere. But the output shows a 3 and a 1, which suggests that the 1 is not being set to zero. So that contradicts the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the maximum is kept, and all other elements are set to zero, but if the maximum is zero, nothing changes. So in the second example, since the maximum is zero, the input's 3 is not being set to zero. So the rule is: find the maximum value in the row. If it's not zero, set all other elements to zero, but leave the maximum as is. If the maximum is zero, leave the row as is.\n\nWait, yes, that makes sense. So in the second example, the last row's maximum is zero, so the output remains all zeros, but the input has a 3. Hmm, that contradicts. Unless the input has a 3 but the maximum is zero, which is not possible unless the row is all zeros.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples.

Let me look at the examples given to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and a single 8 in the middle. The output also has a 0, followed by 2s in the second row, and then an 8 in the last row. So it seems like when there's a non-zero value, it spreads out or perhaps affects the surrounding cells.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 3 at position (6,7). The output also keeps that 3 and adds 3s in the neighboring cells around it. So maybe the rule is that if there's a non-zero value, it propagates to the adjacent cells, or maybe it's a kind of averaging or duplication.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 5 in the top right and another 5 in the middle. The output keeps those 5s and adds 8s around them. So it seems like whenever a cell has a non-zero value, it copies that value to itself and its neighbors. Alternatively, it might be duplicating the value in certain surrounding areas.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the output shows numbers other than zero, like 8s, so perhaps the rule is that for each non-zero value, it copies that value to itself and to its adjacent cells. Or maybe it's a combination of copying and adding.\n\nAnother observation: All examples have a lot of zeros, so the output grid is mostly zeros with some non-zero values based on the input.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the rule is: For each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the input grid has a non-zero value, then the output cell is set to that value, and also the cells adjacent to it (like up, down, left, right, and diagonally maybe) are set to that value as well. Or perhaps it's just the current cell and its immediate neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid propagates to itself and its adjacent cells, creating a kind of \"fire\" effect where non-zero areas spread out.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2, the 3 in the input spreads to its adjacent cells, turning them into 3s. So maybe each non-zero value in the input grid converts itself and its neighbors to the same value.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s in the input grid convert to 5s in the output, and their neighbors also become 5s. Similarly, the 8 in the input becomes 8 in the output.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: For each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the input grid is non-zero, then the output cell is set to that value, and it also affects its adjacent cells, setting those to the same value as the original cell.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 8 in the middle doesn't spread to the surrounding cells. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value in the input cell propagates only to itself and its immediate neighbors, but not further.\n\nSo, to formalize the rule: Each cell in the output is equal to the input cell's value if it's non-zero, and if the input cell's value is non-zero, then that value is also copied to the cell itself and its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonally). Or perhaps it's just the current cell and the adjacent cells.\n\nWait, let's test this idea. In Example 1, the input has an 8 in the middle. According to the rule, the output cell would be 8, and its adjacent cells (like the ones below, to the left, and right) would also be 8. But in the output, only the middle cell is 8, and the rest are 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that any non-zero value in the input cell causes that value to propagate to itself and its adjacent cells, but not further. So, the output cell would be 8 in the middle, and the cells around it would also become 8, but in the output, they remain 8, while others are zeros. Wait, but in the example, the output cell in the middle is 8, while the surrounding cells are 0. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each non-zero value in the input, every cell that is adjacent to it (including diagonally) in the output grid should be set to that value. But in Example 1, the 8 is in the middle, and the output only has 8 in the middle and 0s elsewhere, so that doesn't explain it.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in every cell adjacent to it, but not necessarily the cell itself. Let's check Example 1 again. The input grid has an 8 in the middle, and the output grid has only that 8 and zeros elsewhere. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in the cell itself and in the cell diagonally adjacent. Or maybe just the cell itself and some of its neighbors.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output cell with 0 has the input 3, and the output cell with 8 has the input 5. So maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid sets the corresponding cells in the output grid to that value, and also the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in every cell that is reachable by moving one cell in any direction, including diagonally, from the original cell. But that seems too broad and doesn't match the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in the original cell, and in the cells that are in the same row, same column, and diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nWait, let's see Example 1. The input has an 8 in the middle, and the output has 8 in the middle and zeros elsewhere. So perhaps the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in the cell itself, and in the cells that are diagonally adjacent. But then, in Example 2, the 3 in the top right has 3s in its adjacent cells, which seems to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output grid has that value in the cell and all its adjacent cells (including diagonally adjacent). Let's test this with Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 3 in the top right. The output has 3 in its adjacent cells, including diagonally. So that fits. The 5 in the input has 5s in its adjacent cells, including diagonally. So this seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output only has the 8 in the middle, with zeros elsewhere. If the rule is that each non-zero value in the input causes the output to have that value in the cell and all its adjacent cells, then the surrounding cells would also be 8, which is not the case.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in the cell and its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right), but not the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 in the middle would have its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) as 0 in the input, so the output would have 8 in the center and 0s elsewhere, which matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 in the top right has its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) as 0, so they would be set to 5. But in the output, the 5s are in the top right and some other cells, which suggests that perhaps the rule is more than just immediate neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in the cell and all cells in the same row and column, including the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the 3 in the top right would have its same row and column set to 3, but in the output, the 3 is only in the top right and its diagonally adjacent cells are also 3. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s in the top right and middle have their own row and column set to 5, perhaps, which would match the output.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output also has 8s in the top right and other cells. Maybe the rule is that for each non-zero value, it's copied to itself, all its adjacent cells, and also the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in every cell that is reachable by moving one cell in any direction, including diagonally, from the original cell. But that would cause a lot of zeros in the surrounding cells, which may not match the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the 3 in the top right has its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonally) set to 3, including the cell above it, which is 0 in the input. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s in the top right and middle have their adjacent cells set to 5, including diagonally. So perhaps the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in the cell and all cells in the same row, same column, and the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output also has 8s in the top right and other cells, so perhaps the rule is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each non-zero value in the input, it copies itself to itself and all cells in the same row and column, but not the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 8 is in the middle, and the output has 8 in the middle and zeros elsewhere, which fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 in the top right has its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) set to 3, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s in the top right and middle have their adjacent cells set to 5, matching the output.\n\nSo, based on these observations, the rule seems to be: For each non-zero value in the input grid, the output grid will have that value in the original cell and all its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). That is, the cell itself and the cells that are directly adjacent to it, including diagonally. So, each non-zero value in the input grid affects itself and all 8 surrounding cells, but in the given examples, the surrounding cells are either zeros or other values that are maintained.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output grid has 8 in the top right and other cells. So maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input causes the output grid to have that value in the cell itself and all cells in the same row and column, but not the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nWait, that might make more sense. So, for each non-zero value in the input, the output grid has that value in its row and column, but not in the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nLet me test this with Example 2. The input has a 3 in the top right. The output has 3s in the top row and right column, including the cell itself. That fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 in the top right has 5s in its row and column, including the cell itself. So that matches.\n\nSo, in general, the rule is: For each non-zero value in the input grid, the corresponding row and column in the output grid are set to that value.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output only has the 8 in the middle, with zeros elsewhere. If the rule was to set the entire row and column of the 8, then all cells in the middle row and middle column would be 8, including the surrounding cells, which would be different from the output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in the cell itself, and in the cells that are adjacent (including diagonally) to it. But in Example 1, the 8 is in the middle, and the output only has 8 in the middle and zeros elsewhere. So perhaps the rule is that each non-zero value only affects itself and its immediate adjacent cells (not diagonally), which would make the output grid have 8 in the middle and zeros elsewhere.\n\nWait, but the output in Example 1 shows 8 in the middle and zeros elsewhere, which fits if the rule is to set the original cell and its immediate neighbors to the non-zero value.\n\nWait, let's re-examine Example 1. The input has an 8 in the middle. The output has 8 in the middle and zeros elsewhere. If the rule is that each non-zero value in the input causes the output to have that value in the cell itself and its immediate neighbors, then the surrounding cells would be 8, but in the output, they are 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero value in the input causes the output to have that value in the cell itself and in the cells that are in the same row and column, but not the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 8 is in the middle, and the output has 8 in the middle and zeros elsewhere. If the rule is that each non-zero value in the input affects the cell itself and the cells in the same row and column, then the middle cell has 8, and the surrounding cells have 8. But in the output, they are zero, so that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to summarize the observations again.\n\nBased on the examples, it seems that whenever a cell has a non-zero value in the input, the output grid has that value in the cell itself and also in the cells that are adjacent to it (including diagonally). But in Example 1, the surrounding cells are zero, which suggests that maybe it's not the diagonal that affects, but only the immediate neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in the cell itself and in all cells that are in the same row and column, but not the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the 3 in the top right has its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) set to 3, including the cell itself, which fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s in the top right and middle have their adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonally) set to 5, which fits the output.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: For each non-zero value in the input grid, the output grid is set such that the corresponding cell is equal to that value, and also the cells that are adjacent to it (i.e., up, down, left, right, and diagonally adjacent) are also set to that value.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 8 is in the middle, and the surrounding cells are zeros in the input, but in the output, the surrounding cells are zeros. So that doesn't fit if the rule is to set all adjacent cells to the non-zero value.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output grid has that value in the cell itself and in all cells that are reachable by moving one cell in any direction, including diagonally, from the original cell. But in Example 1, that would mean the output grid has 8 in the center and all surrounding cells as 8, which doesn't match the output.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider that the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the output grid to have that value in the cell itself and in the cells that are diagonally adjacent. So, for each non-zero value, it affects the cell and the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 in the middle would have its diagonally adjacent cells set to 8, but in the output, they are zeros, so that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output grid has that value in the cell itself and all cells in the same row and column, but not the diagonally adjacent ones.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the 3 in the top right would have its same row (top row) and same column (right column) set to 3, including the cell itself, which fits the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s in the top right and middle would have their entire row and column set to 5, including the cell itself, which fits the output.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: For each non-zero value in the input grid, the output grid is copied to the cell itself and all cells in the same row and column, excluding the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 8 is in the middle, and the surrounding cells are zeros in the input. If the rule is to copy the row and column of the 8, then the entire middle row and middle column would be 8, which doesn't match the output.\n\nThis is quite confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs.\n\nLooking at the input and output in Example 2, the input has a 3 in the top right, and the output has 3s in the top row and right column, including the cell itself. So the 3 is in the top right, and its row (top row) and column (right column) are set to 3, with zeros elsewhere.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 in the top right has its row and column set to 5, including the cell itself, while the cells in the same row and column are set to 5, and the other cells remain zero.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid causes the row and column of that cell to be set to that value in the output grid.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 8 is in the middle, and the output only has 8 in the middle, with zeros elsewhere. If the rule is to set the entire row and column of the 8 to 8, then the entire middle row and column would be 8, which doesn't match the output.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that for each non-zero value, the output grid has that value in the cell itself and in all cells that are in the same row and column as the non-zero value, but not the diagonally adjacent cells.\n\nWait, but", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has some zeros and a single 2 in the middle of the second row. The output grid is mostly zeros, except for that same position where there's a 2, and there's another 2s in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh rows. So it seems like in the output, every 2 in the input grid is replaced by a 2 in the corresponding position in the output, and the other 2s in the input grid might be converted to 8s or something else. Hmm, not sure about that yet.\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid has a 0 at the top, then in the seventh row, there's a 3, and in the eighth row, there's a 0, a 3, followed by some zeros, and then a bunch of 8s. The output grid shows that the 3 in the seventh row becomes multiple 3s, and the 8s are converted to 0s. Wait, no, looking closer, the output has 3s in the same positions, but the 8s are turned into 1s. So maybe it's something like if a cell has a 8 in the input, it becomes a 1 in the output, and other numbers are copied over.\n\nWait, let me check Example 2 again. The input has a 3 in the seventh row, and the output has multiple 3s in the same positions. So if the output is preserving the values, that can't be right. Or maybe it's that non-zero values are kept, and zeros are replaced by 1s or something. Or perhaps the rule is that in the output, each cell's value is the maximum between the input and some other value, but looking at the outputs, it seems like in the output, if the input had a 3, the output has multiple 3s, which might mean that any non-zero value is kept, but zeros are replaced by the maximum. Alternatively, maybe the output is the original grid with some transformations applied, like replacing zeros with 8s or something.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has a 5 in the ninth row, and the output has 5s and 8s. So perhaps the rule is that if a cell has a non-zero value, it's kept, and zeros are replaced by 0s or 8s. But in the output, zeros are replaced by 0s, which doesn't change. Maybe it's that any non-zero value is kept as is, and zeros are converted to 8s. Let me see.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1, the output grid has 0s except for a 2 in the second row, second position, and then some 2s in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh rows. So perhaps the rule is that any cell with a 0 remains 0, and any cell with a 2 becomes 2, and any cell with a 3 becomes 3, and so on, but there's more to it. Or maybe it's that in the output, the same positions have the same numbers, but other cells are filled with 0s or 8s based on some rule.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the seventh row has a 3, which in the output is replaced by multiple 3s. The eighth row has a 0, a 3, and some zeros and an 8. The output for the eighth row has 0s except for multiple 3s and an 8. So maybe when a cell in the input has a 3, the output keeps all the 3s, and zeros are converted to 1s? Or perhaps it's that any non-zero value is kept, and zeros are replaced by 0s, but other non-zero values are transformed.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the ninth row has a 5, and the output has 5s and 8s. The 8 in the output suggests that perhaps any zero in the input is replaced by 8, and non-zero values are kept. But in Example 1, the input has a 2, and the output has 2s in the same positions. So maybe the rule is that non-zero values are kept, and zeros are converted to 0s, but other non-zero values are preserved.\n\nWait, but in the output, the 0s are mostly 0s, except for some 8s. So perhaps the rule is that any cell with a zero in the input becomes a 0 in the output, and any non-zero value is copied over. But then why are there 8s in the output? Unless the rule is that if the input has a 0, it becomes an 8, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, looking again at Example 2, the seventh row has a 3, and in the output, the output row has multiple 3s, which matches the input. So perhaps the output has the same values as the input, except for zeros being converted to 0s, which doesn't change. Then why are there 8s in the output? Unless there's a transformation after copying the values.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the output, each cell's value is the maximum between the input and some transformation. For example, if the input has a 0, it becomes 0. If it has a 3, it remains 3. If it has a 5, it becomes 8, perhaps because of some transformation.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3, the ninth row has a 5, and the output has 5 and 8. So perhaps any zero in the input is replaced by 8, but that doesn't fit with other examples. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that in the output, all cells that are zero in the input become 0, but any non-zero value is either kept as is or transformed to 8 if it's above a certain value.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value in the input is copied to the output, and zeros are converted to 0. But that can't explain the 8s. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that any zero in the input becomes 8, and non-zero values are kept as is. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, and the output has 2s. So if the input has a non-zero value, the output has the same value. If the input is zero, it becomes 0. But in the output, some 2s are present in the same positions where the input had zeros, so that might not be it. Alternatively, maybe the output has the same non-zero values as the input, and zeros are replaced by 0s, which doesn't change.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any zero in the input becomes 0 in the output, and any non-zero value is copied. But then why are there 8s in the output? Unless there's a transformation after copying, like replacing any non-zero value with the maximum between itself and 8.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the ninth row has a 5, and the output has 5 and 8. So perhaps if the input has a 5, the output has 8. But why 8? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value in the input is kept, and zeros are converted to 8s. But in Example 1, the input has a 2, and the output has 2s, so that fits. But in Example 2, the seventh row has a 3, and the output has 3s, which fits. The eighth row in Example 2 has a 0, a 3, and an 8. The output for that row has 0s, 3s, 8s, and 0s. So the 8 remains, but the 3s are preserved. So perhaps the rule is that non-zero values are kept, and zeros are converted to 0s, but other non-zero values are kept as is.\n\nBut then, in Example 3, the ninth row has a 5, and the output has 5s and 8s. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value in the input is copied to the output, and zeros are converted to 0s, but other non-zero values are also converted to 8s if they are above a certain threshold.\n\nWait, looking at the examples, perhaps the rule is that any zero in the input is replaced by 0, and any non-zero value is either kept as is or transformed to 8 if it's above a certain value. But in Example 3, the ninth row has a 5, and the output has 5 and 8. So 5 remains 5, and 8 remains 8. Maybe the rule is that any non-zero value is kept as is, but zeros are replaced by 0. But then why are there 8s in the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in the output, each cell's value is the maximum between the input and 0, but that doesn't change anything. Or perhaps the rule is that if the input cell is zero, it becomes 0; if it's non-zero, it remains as is, except zeros are replaced by 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any zero in the input is replaced by 8, and non-zero values are kept as is. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, and the output has 2s. If zeros are replaced by 8, that doesn't fit because the output has 0s in some places. So probably not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value is copied, and zeros are converted to 0s, but other non-zero values are transformed into 8s if they are above a certain value. For example, if the input has a 5, the output has 8; if it's 3, the output has 3; if it's 2, the output has 2.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the ninth row has a 5, and the output has 5 and 8. So perhaps the non-zero values are kept, but zeros are converted to 0. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the output, each cell's value is the maximum between the input and 0, but that doesn't change anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value is copied, and zeros are converted to 0, but other non-zero values are transformed into 8s if they are above a certain threshold. For example, any 0 becomes 0, any non-zero 0 (which doesn't exist) becomes 8, any non-zero number above 2 becomes 8, and non-zero numbers 2 or below remain as is.\n\nWait, that could make sense. Let me test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2. According to the rule, since 2 is greater than or equal to 2, it remains 2. The output has 2s in the same positions, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the seventh row has a 3. According to the rule, since 3 is greater than or equal to 2, it remains 3. The output has multiple 3s in that row. The eighth row has a 0, a 3, and some zeros and an 8. The output for that row has 0s, 3s, 8s, and 0s. So the 3 remains 3, and the 8 remains 8. That fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the ninth row has a 5. According to the rule, since 5 is greater than or equal to 2, it remains 5. The output has 5 and some 8s. Wait, but in the output, the 8s are in the same positions as the input's 8s, which were not present in the input. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value is copied, and zeros are replaced by 0. But then why are there 8s in the output? Unless the rule is that non-zero values are kept, and zeros are replaced by 0, but any non-zero number is replaced by 8 if it's above a certain value.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the output, each cell's value is the maximum between the input and 0, but that doesn't change anything. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that any zero in the input is replaced by 0, and any non-zero value is copied as is, except zeros are converted to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the output, each cell's value is the maximum between the input and 0, but that's just the input values. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that non-zero values are kept, and zeros are converted to 0.\n\nWait, but in the output, zeros are mostly 0s, except for some 8s. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value is kept, and zeros are converted to 0. But in the output, the 8s are in some positions, so perhaps there's a transformation after copying. For example, any non-zero value in the input is copied, and then zeros are replaced by 8s.\n\nWait, let me see. If in the input, a non-zero value is copied, and then zeros are replaced by 8s, then in the output, the non-zero values are as in the input, and zeros are replaced by 8s. But in Example 1, the input has a 2, and the output has 2s. If zeros are replaced by 8s, then the 2 would become 8, but in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in the output, each cell's value is the maximum between the input and 0, but that doesn't change anything.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.\n\nLooking at the examples, maybe the rule is that any zero in the input becomes 0, and any non-zero value is copied to the output, except that in the output, zeros are replaced by 0, and non-zero values are preserved. But then why are there 8s in the output?\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the output, each cell's value is the sum of the input and 0, but that's the same as the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any zero in the input is replaced by 8, and non-zero values are kept as is. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, which according to the rule, would become 8. But in the output, it's 2, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in the output, each cell's value is the maximum between the input and 0, but that's the same as the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any zero in the input is replaced by 0, and any non-zero value is copied as is, except for zeros which are replaced by 0. That seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value is copied, and zeros are converted to 0, but the 8s in the output suggest that any non-zero value is preserved, including 8s, but that doesn't make sense because 8s would remain as is.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any zero in the input is replaced by 8, and non-zero values are copied. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, which is non-zero, so it's copied to the output. But the output has 2s in that position, so that fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the seventh row has a 3, which is copied, and the output has multiple 3s. The eighth row has a 0, a 3, and an 8 in the output. So if the 3 is copied, it's kept as 3, and the 8 remains 8. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the ninth row has a 5, which is copied, and the output has 5 and 8. So 5 remains 5, and 8 remains 8. That fits.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that any zero in the input is replaced by 0, and any non-zero value is copied as is, except that in the output, any non-zero value is preserved, including 8s. But wait, in the examples, the output has 8s, which are present in the input, so perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value is copied, and zeros are converted to 0.\n\nBut then why are the outputs having 8s in some cases? Unless the rule is that any non-zero value is copied, and zeros are converted to 0, but any 8 in the input is kept as is, so perhaps the outputs have the same non-zero values except zeros.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input has a 2, which is copied, and the output has 2s. In Example 2, the input has a 3, which is copied, and the output has multiple 3s. The input has an 8, which is copied, and the output has 8s. So perhaps the rule is that in the output, any non-zero value is copied, and zeros are converted to 0.\n\nBut in the examples, the outputs have 0s in some places, so that makes sense. But then why are the outputs having 8s? Unless the rule is that any non-zero value is copied, and zeros are converted to 0, and any 8 in the input is kept as is.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any zero in the input is replaced by 0, and any non-zero value is copied, except that in the output, any 8 in the input is kept as is, and zeros are replaced by 0. But that seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any zero in the input is replaced by 8, and non-zero values are copied as is. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2, which is non-zero, so it's copied. But the output has 2s, so that fits. If zeros were replaced by 8, then in the output, zeros would become 8, but in Example 1, the output has 0s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the output, any zero in the input becomes 0, and any non-zero value is copied as is, except that in the output, zeros are replaced by 0, and any non-zero value is kept as is.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided and see if I can spot any patterns or similarities.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a single 8 in the middle. The output grid also has a 8 in the same position, but it looks like the 8s are moving around. Hmm, maybe the 8s are being carried over or replaced based on some rule.\n\nIn Example 2, I notice that there's a 3 in a specific position. The input has a 3 in the second row, and the output seems to have the same 3 in the same position. But there are also some zeros there. Wait, maybe the 3s are being replaced by other numbers based on their neighbors or something.\n\nIn Example 3, there's a 5 in the 5th row, and the output also has a 5 in the same position. The 5 seems to be a special number because it's being preserved. So maybe the rule involves replacing 8s and 3s when they appear in certain positions.\n\nLooking at the positions, it seems like the 8 in the first example is moving to a different spot. Maybe it's being replaced by a 2 or another number. In Example 2, the 3 is staying in the same place, so perhaps it's not being moved but just replaced.\n\nIn Example 3, another 5 is in a different spot. I wonder if the 5 is being moved or maybe the 8s are being moved. It's a bit confusing.\n\nI think the rule might involve checking each cell and replacing 8s or 3s based on their neighboring cells. For example, if a cell has an 8, it might turn into a 2 or another number, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are being moved to a specific position, like the center.\n\nAnother possibility is that the 8s are being replaced by 2s when they're in certain areas, and 3s are being replaced by 5s or other numbers. But I need to look at the exact positions to see if there's a consistent pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 8 is in the middle of the grid, but in Example 2, the 3 is also in the middle. Maybe the 8s and 3s are moving towards the center or some other specific cell, like the 5th row in Example 3.\n\nI think I need to analyze the exact movement of the 8 and 3 to understand the rule. If the 8s are moving to a specific position, the rule might involve tracking their movement over multiple examples. Similarly, the 3s might be staying in place but being replaced by other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves looking at the surrounding cells and applying some transformation based on their values. For instance, if a cell has a 3, it might turn into a 2 or another number, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nOverall, I think the rule involves transforming specific cells (like 8s and 3s) based on their neighboring cells or their positions. I need to look for consistent patterns across the examples to determine the exact rule.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, I'm looking at the examples provided, which should help me understand what's happening.\n\nFirst, let's take Example 1. The input has a bunch of zeros and a single 8 in the 10th row. The output shows that the 8 remains in the same position, but the surrounding 2s are spread out. Wait, no, actually looking closer, the 8 is in the last row, and in the output, that 8 is still 8. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero numbers are preserved, but other numbers are changed according to some rule based on their position.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the maximum value in each row. Let's see. In the input, the first row has all zeros except for one 8. The output for that row has the same 8. The second row has a 2. In the output, that 2 becomes 2, but wait, the 2 is in the middle. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a 3 in the 9th row and 8th column. In the output, that 3 remains 3, and the surrounding 0s turn into 3s except for the 8 which is turned into 3 as well. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, in the input of Example 2, the 8 is in the 10th row and 8th column, which is the bottom right corner. In the output, that 8 remains 8, but others are 0 except at the bottom, which becomes 3s.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by the maximum value in its row or column. Let's test that. In Example 1, the input has a single 8 in the last row. The output for that row is 8, which is the maximum. In Example 2, the 3s are in the middle, and the output shows 3s, which is the maximum in their respective rows and columns. The 8s remain as they are, suggesting they are preserved.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the 5s are in the middle rows, and in the output, they are still 5s, which fits. So, perhaps the rule is that non-zero numbers are either preserved or transformed into the maximum value in their row or column, whichever is higher.\n\nWait, but in the input of Example 2, the last row has an 8. Since it's the maximum, it remains 8. Similarly, other 3s in the output are 3s, which might be because they are the maximum in their rows or columns.\n\nSo, the rule could be that each non-zero number in the input is replaced by the maximum value between its row and column in the input grid, and zero remains zero.\n\nWait, but let me check Example 1 again. The 8 is in the last row. The output for that row is 8, which is correct. The 2s in the second row of Example 1 (input) become 2 in the output. Wait, but if we take the maximum of the row and column, maybe the 2 is in a column where the maximum is higher. Wait, no, in the second row of Example 1, the input is:\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nIn the output, it's:\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nSo, the 2 remains 2. The other non-zero numbers in the input are 2s, but they become 2s in the output. So maybe the rule is that non-zero numbers are preserved, but perhaps in specific positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each number is either kept as is or replaced with the maximum of its row and column, whichever is applicable. But in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the fifth column of the second row. The output for that column has 2, which is the same, so that might not change it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each non-zero number is retained if it's the maximum in its row or column, otherwise it's replaced by the maximum of the row or column. But that seems a bit vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2, the input has a 3 in the 8th row and 8th column, which in the output remains 3. The surrounding 0s become 3s. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by the maximum value in its row or column if it's larger than zero. So, if a number is larger than zero, it's set to the maximum of its row or column. If a number is zero, it remains zero.\n\nWait, but in the input of Example 1, the 8 is in the last row. The output for that row is 8, which is correct. The 2s in the second row of Example 1 are 2s in the output, which could be because they are the maximum in their respective rows or columns. Wait, but in the second row of Example 1, the input is:\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nAnd the output is:\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nSo, the 2 remains 2. But if the rule is to take the maximum of the row or column, then for the 2 in the second row, the maximum in that row is 2, so it remains 2. In the same row, but wait, the 2 is the only non-zero in that row, so it's 2. The 8 in the last row is the maximum of its column, so it remains 8.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero number is replaced by the maximum value in its row or column, whichever is applicable. So, for a cell with value x, if x is not zero, set it to the maximum of the row's maximum and the column's maximum, and only if that maximum is non-zero. But in the examples, some cells remain the same as their original value.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the case because in the input of Example 1, the cell with 8 is in the last row, and the maximum of its row is 8, so it remains 8. Similarly, in Example 2, the 8 is in the last row, and the maximum of its row is 8, so it remains 8. The 3s in the second row of Example 1: the maximum of the row is 2, but the 3 is in the same position as the 2 in the input, so it remains 2? Wait, but the output for the second row of Example 1 is:\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nWhich shows that the 2 remains 2, but the 3 in the input is gone. Wait, no, in the input, the second row has a 3 in the fifth column. In the output, that column has a 2. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by the maximum of the row and column, but if the maximum is zero, then the original value is kept.\n\nWait, but in the input of Example 1, the 2s are in the second row and fifth column. The maximum of the second row is 2, so they remain 2. The maximum of the fifth column is 2, so the 2s in the second row and fifth column remain 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero number is replaced by the maximum value in its row and column, but if the row's maximum is non-zero, then it's replaced with the row's maximum. Otherwise, it's replaced with the column's maximum. If both are zero, it remains zero.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the 3s are in the second row and fifth column. The maximum of the row is 3, so they remain 3. The maximum of the fifth column is 3, so the 3s in the fifth column remain 3.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the 5s in the second row and fifth column have a maximum of 5 in their row and column. So they remain 5. The 8 is in the last row and eighth column, and the row's maximum is 8, so it remains 8.\n\nWait, but in the input of Example 2, the 8 is in the last row and eighth column. The row's maximum is 8, so it remains 8. The 3s in the second row and fifth column have a maximum of 3, so they remain 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero number in the input is replaced by the maximum value between the maximum value in its row and the maximum value in its column.\n\nIf that maximum is non-zero, then the number is set to that maximum. If the maximum is zero, then the number remains zero.\n\nBut wait, in the input of Example 1, the 2s in the second row have a row maximum of 2 and a column maximum of 2, so they remain 2. The 8 in the last row has a row maximum of 8 and a column maximum of 8, so it remains 8.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3s have row maximum 3 and column maximum 3, so they remain 3. The 8 in the last row has row maximum 8, so it remains 8.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s have row and column maxima of 5, so they remain 5. The 8 in the last row has row maximum 8, so it remains 8.\n\nSo, the rule could be: for each cell with a non-zero value, set it to the maximum of the row's maximum value and the column's maximum value.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The input has an 8 in the last row. The row's maximum is 8, so it remains 8. The 2s in the second row: row maximum is 2, column maximum is 2, so they remain 2. The 0s are left as 0.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3s in the second row: row maximum is 3, column maximum is 3, so they remain 3. The 8 in the last row: row maximum is 8, so it remains 8.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s in the second row: row maximum is 5, column maximum is 5, so they remain 5. The 8 in the last row: row maximum is 8, so it remains 8.\n\nSo, this seems to fit the examples. Therefore, the rule is: each non-zero number is replaced by the maximum value between the maximum in its row and the maximum in its column.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the given input for Example 3:\n\nThe input has a 5 in the second row, eighth column. The row's maximum is 5, and the column's maximum is 5, so it remains 5. The 8 in the last row, eighth column: row maximum is 8, and the column's maximum is 8, so it remains 8.\n\nSo, the output for that cell remains 8.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: for each cell (i,j), if the value is non-zero, set it to the maximum of the maximum value in row i and the maximum value in column j.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the given input for Example 3:\n\nThe input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, that's all zeros except for the last row, which has an 8 in the 8th column. Applying the rule: for that cell, row maximum is 8 (since it's the only non-zero in its row), column maximum is also 8 (since it's the only non-zero in its column). So, the 8 remains 8.\n\nBut in the output, the last row has 8 in the 8th column, which matches. So, that cell remains 8.\n\nBut in the input, the cell in the 10th row and 8th column is 8, which in the output remains 8. Wait, in the given input, the last row has a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and a single 8 in the 10th row. The output also has zeros everywhere except the 10th row, which has 2s and an 8. Wait, but the output doesn't have an 8 in the 10th row; instead, it's 2s and 8. Hmm, maybe the 8 is somehow being replaced. Or perhaps it's the 8 that's being considered, and others are being reduced to 2s.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a 3 in the 10th row and 9th column. The output shows 3s in the first few rows but not in the 10th. Wait, the output in Example 2 is mostly zeros except for the first few rows, which have 3s, and the last rows have some 0s and 3s. So maybe the rule is that any number in the input is reduced to a smaller number if it's greater than a certain value.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 5 in the 11th row and 8th column. The output in Example 3 shows 5s in some places and 8s in others. But the output in the example given doesn't have an 8, so maybe it's similar to Example 1.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the rule is that each number in the input is replaced by the minimum between itself and 2. But wait, in Example 1, the 8 was replaced, but in Example 3, also 5 and 8 were used. Alternatively, perhaps it's taking the minimum of the number and 2, but that doesn't match because in Example 3, the 8 remains 8, which would be the minimum if it's replaced by 2, but it's not. So maybe it's something else.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule involves the sum of adjacent cells. For example, in a cell, if the sum of its neighbors is greater than a certain value, it gets updated. But I'm not sure how that would translate in the examples provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace each number with the number itself if it's less than or equal to 2, and set it to 2 otherwise. But in Example 1, the 8 was replaced, so that can't be.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 1, the input has a single 8, and the output has 2s and an 8. So perhaps the 8 is being kept, and the other numbers are being reduced to 2 except for the 8 itself. But that doesn't fit with the other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 in the input is being kept, and the 9 is being replaced. So maybe any number greater than a certain threshold is being reduced. But what's the threshold?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the 5 is being kept, and the 8 is being replaced. So maybe it's the maximum of the number and 2. Wait, no, because in Example 1, the 8 is kept, which would be the maximum, but in Example 3, it's also kept as 8, which is the maximum.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that any number greater than 2 is reduced to 2, and numbers below or equal to 2 remain as they are. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is greater than 2, so it should be replaced with 2, which matches the output. All other cells in the input are 0 or 7, which are also replaced with 2, except for the 7 in the middle of the input, which remains 7 in the output. Wait, in Example 1, the 7 in the input is in the 9th row, and the output shows 2s and an 8. So this doesn't fit. So maybe the rule isn't simply replacing numbers greater than 2 with 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any number in the input greater than 2 is reduced to 2, but numbers less than or equal to 2 are kept as they are. But in Example 3, the 5 is in the input and in the output, it's 5, so that doesn't fit. Wait, no, in Example 3, the 5 remains 5, so perhaps it's not being replaced.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the positions of the numbers. In Example 1, the 8 is in the 10th row, and in the output, it's also in the 10th row but as 8. So perhaps the 8 is being kept, and other numbers are being reduced.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 is in the 10th row and the 9th column, and in the output, it's also 3. The 0s are being reduced, but the 3 remains as is. So maybe any number in the input is reduced to 2 if it's greater than 2, but the 3 is not being reduced, so that contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any number is replaced by 2, but if it's already 2 or less, it remains. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 would be replaced by 2, which matches the output. The 7 in the input would be replaced by 2, but in the output, it's 2. Wait, no, the output shows 7 in the middle row, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at Example 3. The input has a 5 and 8. The output has 5 and 8 in certain rows. So perhaps the 5 is being kept, and the 8 is being kept as well.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 8 is in the input and remains as 8 in the output. So perhaps the rule is that the 8 is being kept, and other numbers are being reduced.\n\nWait, looking more closely, in Example 1, the input has a single 8 in the 10th row. The output has an 8 in the same position, so perhaps the 8 is being kept and the other numbers are being reduced. In the input, the other numbers are 0 or 7, so they are reduced to 2 and 0 respectively.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 3 in the 10th row and 9th column. The output has 3s in the first few rows and 0s elsewhere. So perhaps numbers above a certain threshold are reduced to 2, and below are kept as is.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the 3 is being kept as 3, so perhaps numbers above 2 are reduced to 2, but numbers below are kept as is. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is above 2, so it's reduced to 2. The 7 in the middle row is above 2, so it's reduced to 2. The 0s remain 0. So the output in Example 1 would have 2s in the middle rows, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 is kept as 3, and the 0s remain 0. The 9 in the input is 0 in the output, so it's below the threshold.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 is kept as 5, and the 0s remain 0. The 8 is kept as 8.\n\nSo putting this together, maybe the rule is that any number in the input that is greater than 2 is reduced to 2, and numbers less than or equal to 2 are kept as is.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with all the examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput has 8 (reduced to 2), 7 (reduced to 2), and 0s. The output matches, so this works.\n\nExample 2:\nInput has 3 (kept), 9 (reduced to 2, but in the output, it's 0. Wait, no. Wait, in Example 2, the 3 is kept, and the 0s are kept. The 9 is 0 in the input, but in the output, it's 0. Hmm, this contradicts my hypothesis because 9 is 9 which is greater than 2, so it should be reduced to 2, but in the output, it's 0. So my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is different. Maybe the rule is that any number is replaced by 2 if it's greater than or equal to 3, and kept as is otherwise. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is >=3, so it's reduced to 2. The 7 is >=3, so reduced to 2. The 0s remain 0. The output matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 is kept as 3, the 9 is >=3, so reduced to 2. But in the output, the 9 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is not based on the number being greater than 2, but on the sum of adjacent cells or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to take the minimum of the cell's value and 2, but then in Example 2, the 3 would become 3, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to see what changes occur in the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is kept as 8, and the other cells are reduced to 2 or 0 as needed.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 is kept as 3, and the 9 is replaced with 0. So perhaps the rule is that any number greater than 2 is reduced to 2, but numbers 2 or less are kept as is.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the 9 is 9, which is greater than 2, so it should be reduced to 2, but in the output, it's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any number is reduced to 2 if it's greater than or equal to 3, and kept as is otherwise. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is >=3, so reduced to 2. The 7 is >=3, so reduced to 2. The 0s remain 0.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 is kept as 3. The 9 is >=3, so reduced to 2, but in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is more complex. Let's look for other patterns.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is in the input, and the output has 8 in the same position. So perhaps the 8 is being kept, and other numbers are being reduced.\n\nIn the input, the other numbers are 0 or 7. In the output, 0 remains 0, 7 becomes 2, and 8 remains 8.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 is kept as 3, and the 0s remain 0. The 9 in the input is 0 in the output, so it's being reduced.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the 9 is 0, which is less than 2, so perhaps the rule is that any number is reduced to 2 if it's greater than 2, and kept as is otherwise.\n\nSo let's test this:\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is >=3, so reduced to 2. The 7 is >=3, so reduced to 2. The 0s remain 0. The output matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 is kept as 3, the 9 is 0, which is <2, so kept as 0. The 0s remain 0. The output matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 is kept as 5, and the 8 is kept as 8. The 0s remain 0. The output matches.\n\nSo this seems to fit all examples. So the rule is that any number in the input is reduced to 2 if it's greater than 2, and remains as it is if it's 2 or less.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 7 is reduced to 2, which is correct because 7>2. The 8 remains 8 because 8>2.\n\nIn Example 2, the 9 is 0, which is <2, so it remains 0. The 3 remains 3.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 and 8 are kept as is because they are greater than 2.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the 5 is in the input and in the output, it's 5. The 8 is in the input and in the output, it's 8.\n\nSo the rule holds.\n\nAnother test: let's take a number 1. It should remain 1. A number 2 should remain 2. A number 3 or higher should be reduced to 2.\n\nSo applying this rule, the output grid would have all numbers reduced to 2 if they are greater than 2, else left as is.\n\nSo in the examples provided, this rule seems to hold.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros except for a 2 in the middle row, third column. The output grid shows that the 2 is replaced with two 2s in the corresponding position. The surrounding zeros remain zero. So, it seems like the 2 is being duplicated in its place. That's a possibility.\n\nBut wait, let me check another part. In the input grid, there's a 3 in the 7th row, middle column. The output grid has 3s in that position as well, but it's in a different place. Maybe the rule isn't just about duplicating, but perhaps about some kind of transformation based on the values.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a 3 in the 7th row, second column. The output shows that it's replaced with 3s in both the same and another position. So, it's not just a single change; there seems to be more to it. Also, in the input, there's a 6 and an 8, which are present in the output as well. So, duplication isn't the only thing happening.\n\nMaybe the rule involves both the value and its position. For instance, if a cell has a value, it might be duplicated if it's the same in its mirrored position. Let me test this idea with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is in the center. If we consider the grid's symmetry, it's already symmetric, so the duplication makes sense. The 3 in the output is in a different position, but how does that fit into duplication? Maybe the rule is that each cell's value is copied to its counterpart, and if the cell is in the same position as another, it's combined.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the 3 is in the middle, and the output shows the same 3 as two separate values. That seems confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 5, and the output shows multiple 5s. So, if the rule is that each cell's value is copied to its mirrored position, then the 5 in the 5th row would have its mirror in the same row but mirrored columns. For example, if the grid is 10x10, the 5th row would have a 5 in the 5th column, and its mirror would be the same, making two 5s.\n\nBut in the output, the 5 is in the 5th row and 5th column, and another 5 is in the same row but mirrored. So, that fits. Similarly, the 8s are in the 9th row and 9th column, and their mirrors, which would also be 8s, so they appear multiple times.\n\nSo, it seems like the rule is that each cell's value is copied to its mirrored position. That way, if a cell has a value, it appears in both the original and mirrored positions. Therefore, in the output, for each cell, if it has a value, it is duplicated in its mirrored location.\n\nLet me apply this rule to the examples:\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 in the center is duplicated, so it becomes two 2s. The 3 and 6 are in positions that don't have duplicates, so they remain as is. Wait, but in the output, the 3s are still present. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output shows that the 2 is duplicated, but the 3s are also duplicated. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the input and output again.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the third column, second row, and elsewhere zeros. The output has two 2s in that position, but also other 2s elsewhere. So, maybe the rule is that each cell's value is duplicated, but not just for the center. Or perhaps it's about the grid's symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is preserved in its mirrored position, regardless of duplication. So, if a cell has a value, it appears exactly once in its mirrored position, and if it's a single cell, it remains as is.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, there's a 3 in the output that's not present in the input. So, that suggests that the rule is more than just duplication. Maybe the rule is that each cell's value is copied to its mirrored position, and if the mirrored position already has a value, it's combined.\n\nWait, that might explain the duplication. For example, if a cell has a value, and its mirrored cell has a value, then the mirrored cell's value is added to the original. So, for example, if the original cell has a 2, and the mirrored cell has a 3, then the output would have a 5 in that position.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output shows two 2s in the center. So, perhaps each cell's value is copied to its mirrored position, but if a cell is in a position that's mirrored by itself (like the center in an odd-sized grid), it's only copied once.\n\nWait, let me double-check the examples. In Example 1, the input has a 2 in the center and other zeros. The output has two 2s in that position. So, that fits. For the 3 in the input, which is in a different position, the output has two 3s in some positions. But in the output, the 3 is still present.\n\nWait, no, in the output, the 3 is in the same position as it was, but duplicated. So, perhaps each cell's value is duplicated in its mirrored position, regardless of its original value.\n\nBut then, in Example 2, the input has a 3 in the middle, and the output has two 3s. That matches. The 6 in the output has two 6s, so that also fits. The 8s are duplicated as well.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the 5 in the 5th row is duplicated, and the 8s are duplicated as well. So, this seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that each cell's value is copied to its mirrored position in the grid. So, for each cell, if it exists in its mirrored position (i.e., it's a square grid and its row index plus column index equals the total size minus one), then its value is duplicated in both positions. If the mirrored position doesn't exist (like the center in an odd-sized grid), then the value is duplicated in both positions.\n\nWait, but in the center, each cell's mirrored position is itself, so the value would only be duplicated once in that position. So, the output would have two 2s in the center, as in Example 1.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 3 in the middle, which is duplicated to become two 3s in the output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the 5s and 8s are duplicated in their mirrored positions.\n\nSo, the rule is that each cell's value is copied to its mirrored position. So, if a cell is in a mirrored position (i.e., it's symmetric with respect to the center), then its value is duplicated there.\n\nTherefore, in the output grid, each cell's value is either the same as in the input (if it's not mirrored) or duplicated in its mirrored position.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the test input grid would involve checking each cell and its mirrored counterpart, and if they are mirrored, duplicating the value.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The output grid shows that the 2 has spread out to the cells around it, becoming 2s in those positions. The rest of the grid remains zeros. It seems like the 2 is being replicated in a 3x3 area centered on its original position.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 3 in the 8th row and 4th column. The output places this 3 in the 8th row and 4th column as well, but it also seems to spread the 3s to adjacent cells in a similar 3x3 pattern. The cell with 3 in the output is surrounded by 0s except for the 3 itself, suggesting the same replication rule as in Example 1.\n\nExample 3 shows a 5 in the 9th row and 5th column. The output places this 5 in the same position and spreads it to adjacent cells, maintaining the 3x3 duplication. This again follows the rule of replicating the number in a surrounding 3x3 grid.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that each number in the input grid is replicated in a 3x3 grid centered on its position. If the original position is at a boundary (like the top row or leftmost column), the replication would just happen within the grid's limits.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input grid, I'll ensure that each number is surrounded by 3x3 areas where it remains unchanged. For cells at the edges, the replication will only go inward as far as the grid allows.\n\nAfter applying this rule, I'll reconstruct the output grid accordingly, making sure that each number is correctly placed in its 3x3 area without extending beyond the grid's boundaries.\n</think>", -0.25], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the examples, the input and output grids have a lot of zeros except for some numbers. The first example's output grid has some non-zero values, but many remain zeros. The second example has a different pattern, with a '3' in the middle and some '1's around it. The third example has a '5' and an '8' in specific positions.\n\nI notice that in the first example, the output grid seems to be a reflection of the input where non-zero values are mirrored. But wait, the output grid also has more zeros than the input. Hmm, maybe it's not just a simple reflection.\n\nAnother observation is that the numbers seem to follow a certain pattern. For instance, in the second example, the output has a '3', which is a number that's higher than the surrounding zeros. The '1's might be indicating something else, like the number of times a particular condition is met around that position.\n\nI think I need to look for a rule that explains how each cell in the output grid is determined based on the cells in the input grid. Maybe it's related to the minimum or maximum values in a neighborhood around each cell.\n\nWait, in the third example, the '5's and '8's are in specific positions. The '5' is in the center, and the '8's are on the edges. This suggests that maybe the number 5 is the minimum value in the neighborhood, and 8 is the maximum. But the '1's are also present, which might represent the count of something.\n\nLet me test this idea. If I take the minimum value in a 3x3 neighborhood around each cell, in the third example, the '5' would be the minimum value in its vicinity, which matches the output. Similarly, the '8's would be the maximums in their respective neighborhoods. The '1's could be the count of cells that are 8 in their neighborhoods.\n\nWait, in the third example's output, the '8's are in positions where their neighborhood has other '8's. So the '1's might represent the count of '8's in the 3x3 area. If that's the case, then the '5's are the minimums, and the '8's are the maximums, with '1's indicating the count of the maximums.\n\nBut let me check if this fits the other examples. In the first example, the non-zero value is 2. The minimum in a 3x3 area would probably be lower, so maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the opposite. Maybe the output is the maximum in the neighborhood. But in the first example, the output has a 2, which would be the maximum if the input had a 2 and the others around were lower. But the output grid in the first example has a 2 in the center of a row, but all other positions are zeros. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule isn't based on neighborhood minima or maxima. Let me think differently. Maybe the rule is to count the number of non-zero values in a local area.\n\nLooking back at the examples, in the second example, the output has a '3' in the center, surrounded by '1's. The '1's could indicate that there are three non-zero values in the neighborhood, but that doesn't quite add up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the opposite: the output is the number of non-zero values in the neighborhood. In the second example, the output has a '3' because there are three non-zero values (the '3' and two '1's). But in the first example, the output has a '2' where there are two non-zero values, but in the input, it's a single '2' surrounded by zeros. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of non-zero values in the neighborhood. In the second example, the '3' would be the sum of three non-zero values (the '3' and two '1's), which adds up to 5, but the output has '3' in the center. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the minimum value in the neighborhood. In the second example, the output has a '3' in the center, and the surrounding '1's could indicate that there are three non-zero values. But if the minimum is 1, that doesn't fit the output.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern in the outputs based on the inputs.\n\nLooking at the third example, the output has a '5' and an '8' in specific positions. The '5' is surrounded by zeros, except for another '5' nearby. Maybe the rule is that each non-zero in the output is the minimum value in a 3x3 square around that position, and the '8's are the maximums.\n\nIn the first example, the output has a '2' in the middle of the row. If the minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood is 0 except for the '2' and another cell, which might be 2, then the '2' would be the minimum. But in the input, all other cells are zero, so the minimum would be zero, which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to count the number of non-zero cells in the 3x3 neighborhood. In the first example, the '2' in the center would have one non-zero cell, so the count would be 1, but the output has a '2'. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the opposite: the output is the maximum number of non-zero cells in any 3x3 square around a cell. That would mean for each cell, we look at all possible 3x3 squares around it and count how many non-zero cells they have, then take the maximum of those counts.\n\nLet's test this with the first example. The output cell with '2' has a 3x3 neighborhood with mostly zeros, but perhaps in some cases, it's surrounded by non-zeros. But the first example's output is 0 except for the '2' in the middle of a row, which might not fit this rule.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the rule is simpler. Let me look for a pattern in the input and output.\n\nIn the second example, the output has a '3' in the center, and surrounding '1's. The '1's could indicate a count of something. The input has a '3' surrounded by zeros, so maybe the output is the count of non-zero values in the 3x3 neighborhood.\n\nWait, in the second example's input, the '3' is in position (1,5), and the output has a '3' in the same position, surrounded by '1's. If the count is 3 non-zero values, then the '3' would fit. But in the input, only one value is non-zero, so this doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count is the number of non-zero values, but in the second example, the output has a '3', which would require three non-zero values in the neighborhood, but the input has only one. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the maximum value in the 3x3 neighborhood. In the second example, the output has a '3' where the maximum in the neighborhood would be, but the input has a '3' and zeros elsewhere, so that fits. The surrounding '1's might be indicating that there are no higher values.\n\nBut in the first example, the output has a '2' in a row of zeros. That doesn't fit because the maximum in the 3x3 neighborhood would be zero.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that each cell is the minimum value in the 3x3 neighborhood. In the second example, the output cell with '3' would be the minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood, which would be lower than '3', so that doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm missing something. Maybe the rule is about the number of non-zero values in a specific pattern. For example, the '3's might be in positions where they are the number of non-zero values in their neighborhood.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the surrounding cells, but that doesn't explain the '3's in the second example.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the output is the count of non-zero cells in the input grid that are greater than a certain value. For example, if we set a threshold, any cell above that threshold in the 3x3 neighborhood would contribute to the count.\n\nBut in the second example, the output has a '3' in the center, which would require three non-zero cells, which is present in the input. The surrounding '1's might indicate that the count is exactly three, but that doesn't fit the rule.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs and inputs.\n\nIn the second example, the output has a '3' and several '1's. The input has a '3' and zeros elsewhere. The '1's could be indicating that there are three non-zero values in the 3x3 neighborhood. But in the input, there is only one non-zero value, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the '1's represent the number of times a certain condition is met. For example, if a '1' exists in the 3x3 neighborhood, it means that condition is met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the sum of the non-zero values in the 3x3 neighborhood. In the second example, the output has a '3' where the sum of non-zero values would be three, which matches. The '1's might indicate that the sum is exactly three, but that doesn't fit the rule.\n\nI'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should try to find a pattern in the numbers.\n\nIn the third example, the output has '5's in the center, which might be the minimum in their 3x3 neighborhoods. The '8's are higher, so maybe they are the maximums. The '1's could represent something else, like the count of maximums.\n\nWait, in the third example, the output has '5's in positions where their 3x3 neighborhoods have other '5's. So maybe the rule is that each '5' is the minimum value in its 3x3 neighborhood, and the '8's are the maximums.\n\nBut in the first example, the output has a '2' in a row of zeros. That doesn't fit because the minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood would be zero.\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a rule that applies to all examples.\n\nIn the first example, the output has a '2' in the middle of a row, but all other cells are zero. In the input, there is a '2' and the rest are zeros. So maybe the rule is that the '2' is the minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood, which is the case.\n\nIn the second example, the output has a '3' in the center, surrounded by '1's. The input has a '3' and zeros elsewhere. So maybe the '3' is the minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood, which is the case.\n\nIn the third example, the output has '5's where their 3x3 neighborhoods have other '5's, which suggests that '5' is the minimum. The '8's are the maximums, and the '1's might represent the count of maximums.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the 3x3 neighborhood. In the first example, the only non-zero cell is the '2', and its minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood is zero except for itself, which would make it zero. Wait, but the output has a '2'. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the cell is the maximum of its 3x3 neighborhood. In the first example, the maximum would be '2', which fits. In the second example, the maximum is '3', which fits. In the third example, the '5's are the minimum, and the '8's are the maximum.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because in the third example, the '8's are higher than '5's, which contradicts the idea that they are maximums.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that the cell is the minimum if the value is lower than the surrounding, and the maximum otherwise. But that might not explain the '1's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the cell is the number of non-zero values in the 3x3 neighborhood. In the second example, the center cell has three non-zero values, so it's '3', which fits. But in the first example, the '2' wouldn't fit because the neighborhood has zeros, so the count would be zero.\n\nI'm not sure anymore. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the rule is that each cell is the number of times a certain condition is met in its 3x3 neighborhood. For example, the '3's are where a certain condition occurs three times, and the '1's are where it occurs once.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rule, it's hard to deduce. Maybe the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the 3x3 neighborhood, and in the first example, the '2' is the minimum in its 3x3 neighborhood, which includes itself and other zeros, making it zero. That doesn't fit, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the 3x3 neighborhood, and if the minimum is higher than zero, that's the value. But in the first example, the '2' is the minimum, which would be zero except for itself, so it would remain zero. That doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs and inputs.\n\nIn the second example, the output has a '3' and '1's. The input has a '3' and zeros. The '1's could indicate that the count is exactly three, which would fit if the rule is that the output is the count of non-zero values in the 3x3 neighborhood. But in the first example, the '2' wouldn't fit because the count would be zero.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the count of non-zero values in the 3x3 neighborhood. In the second example, the center has three non-zero values, so the output is '3'. In the first example, the center would have one non-zero value (the '2'), so the output is '1', but the output shows a '2'. So that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the 3x3 neighborhood, but if the minimum is higher than zero, it's kept, otherwise, it's zero.\n\nIn the first example, the '2' would be the minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood, so the output would have a '2' in that position. But in the output, all other positions are zero except the '2', which fits.\n\nIn the second example, the '3' would be the minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood, which matches the output.\n\nThe third example shows that '5's are the minimums, which fits, and '8's are the maximums, which also fits.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each cell, take the minimum value in the 3x3 neighborhood centered on that cell. If the minimum value is higher than zero, leave it; otherwise, set it to zero. But in the first example, the '2' in the center would have a neighborhood with other zeros, so the minimum is zero, which would set it to zero, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that contradicts. So maybe the rule is that each cell is the minimum value in the 3x3 neighborhood, but if the minimum is higher than zero, it's kept; otherwise, it's zero.\n\nIn the first example, the '2' would be the minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood, so it remains '2', which fits the output.\n\nIn the second example, the '3' is the minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood, so it remains '3', which fits.\n\nIn the third example, the '5's are the minimums, which remain '5's, and the '8's are the maximums, which remain '8's.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each cell, find the minimum value in its 3x3 neighborhood. If the minimum is higher than zero, leave it; otherwise, set it to zero. But wait, in the second example, the '3' is the minimum, so it remains '3', which fits.\n\nSo, in the first example, the '2' is in the center of a row of zeros, so the 3x3 neighborhood around it includes other zeros, so the minimum is zero. But the output has a '2' instead. That suggests that the rule isn't just taking the minimum; maybe it's taking something else.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the minimum value, but if it's the smallest value in the neighborhood, leave it as is. Or perhaps it's taking the maximum.\n\nWait, in the third example, the '5's are the minimums, which would make sense if the rule is to take the minimum. The '8's are the maximums, which fits.\n\nBut in the first example, the '2' is in a row of zeros, so the 3x3 neighborhood around it includes other zeros, making the minimum zero, but the output has a '2'. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the 3x3 neighborhood, but if the minimum is higher than zero, it's set to the minimum value, otherwise, zero. But that doesn't explain the first example.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the 3x3 neighborhood, and if it's the minimum, it's set to that value, but if it's higher than the minimum, it's set to zero. That doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should try to write a small program to find the rule based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum value in the 3x3 neighborhood, and in the first example, the '2' is the minimum, so it remains '2'.\n\nIn the second example, the '3' is the minimum, so it remains '3'.\n\nIn the third example, the '5's are the minimums, and '8's are the maximums.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that for each cell, if it's the minimum in its 3x3 neighborhood, it's set to that value. If it's the maximum, it's set to that value. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nBut in the first example, the '2' is in the center of a row of zeros, so the 3x3 neighborhood", -0.25], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me look at the examples provided to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1, I notice that in the input, most cells are zeros, except for a few. For instance, the cell at position (1,1) has a 2, and another 2 is in the cell (3,1). In the output, the same positions have 2s and an 8. It seems like maybe the 2s are being replaced by 8s in certain rows. \n\nLooking at Example 2, the input grid has a 3 in the cell (6,8). The output also has a 3 in the same position, but there's also an 8 in (6,1). Hmm, so maybe the 3 is being retained, and the 8 is added elsewhere. \n\nIn Example 3, there's a 5 in the cell (7,5), and in the output, there's a 5 in the same spot. Also, there's an 8 in (7,6) and maybe another one in (7,7). It looks like the 5 is being preserved, and the 8 is being added in specific cases.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the rule is that certain specific cells have their values replaced by 8. Specifically, in the output grid, most cells remain zero, but when a particular pattern is found in the input, the corresponding cell in the output is set to 8. \n\nFrom the examples, the positions where 8 appears in the output seem to be in the same row as the original 8. For instance, in Example 1, the 8 in the output is in row 8. In Example 2, it's in row 6. In Example 3, it's in row 7. It appears that the 8 is being placed in the same row as the original value in the input, but only in specific cases.\n\nAnother observation is that when a cell in the input has a 3 or 5, the output retains that value, but when a cell has a 0, it remains 0. So the rule is likely that if a cell in the input has a non-zero value, it is retained in the output, and certain specific 0s are replaced with 8s based on specific patterns.\n\nTo formalize this, I think the rule is as follows: For each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the input grid is non-zero, then that cell is copied to the output. Additionally, if a specific pattern (like a 2 followed by 8s or a 3 followed by an 8) is found in the input, the corresponding cell in the output is set to 8, while all other cells remain as they are.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again, the input cell at (6,8) is 3, and the output remains 3, but the cell at (6,1) becomes 8. This suggests that the 3 is not being replaced, but the 8 is being added based on the pattern.\n\nIn Example 3, the input cell at (7,5) is 5, and the output remains 5. The cells at (7,6) and (7,7) become 8, indicating that in these cases, the original value of 5 is being retained, but 8s are added in specific rows.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule is that any non-zero cell in the input grid is copied to the output grid. Additionally, certain specific 0 cells in the input grid are replaced with 8s, based on specific patterns or rows.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid provided, I need to identify which cells are being replaced with 8s and update the grid accordingly.\n</think>", -0.25], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples given.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a single 2 in the middle. The output grid shows that the 2 becomes 2, and the surrounding zeros also seem to be preserved. But wait, in the output, I don't see any other numbers, so maybe the rule is about replacing a 2 with another 2? Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Also, there's a 3 and an 8 in the output grid, which weren't present in the input. So maybe there's more to it.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 3 in the middle of the second row and a 3 in the second-to-last row. The output seems to have similar patterns where those numbers are replaced with 3s and 1s. For example, the second row of the output has 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, that doesn't quite match the input. Maybe the rule is that certain numbers are replaced by others. Like if a cell has a 0, it remains 0. If it has a 3, it becomes 3. If it has a higher number, maybe it's split into multiple parts or adjusted.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 5 in the sixth row. The output shows two 5s and an 8 replacing it. So the rule seems to be that a cell with a number greater than 2 is split into multiple cells with smaller numbers. For example, 5 is split into 5 and 5, and 8 is split into 8, 8, 8, 8 or something like that. But wait, in the output, the sixth row has 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0. So it's not just replacing 5 with two 5s, but maybe it's splitting into multiple digits or parts. Or perhaps it's a carry-over mechanism where a number is carried over to the next cell.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output for row 2, column 6 has a 3, and in Example 3, row 6 is split into 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0. So maybe the rule is that when a number is greater than 2, it's split into its digits, and each digit is replaced. For example, 8 becomes 8, 8, 8, 8, but in the third example, the output has 8, 8, 8, 8, which matches. However, in the first example, output had 8, which might be because of a 0 in the input adding up to 8 somehow. Wait, no, the first example input has 0s and an 8, but the output in row 10 is 0, and row 11 is 8, which suggests that perhaps 8 in the input stays as 8 in the output. Or maybe it's a carry-over that 0s become 8s somewhere.\n\nWait, in the first example, the input has 0s and an 8 in the middle. The output has 0s except for the middle row, which has 8. So maybe when a cell has an 8, it remains 8. But in the second example, the input has an 8 in the third row, and the output has 8, 8, 8, 8, which suggests that the 8 is being split into four 8s. Or maybe 8 is being split into two parts, each being 4 or something, but in the output, it's four 8s. That seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each digit in the number is represented in the output, but only if the digit is greater than 2. So for example, a 3 would become 3 in the output, and an 8 would become 8. But in Example 2, the output for row 12 has 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0. So it's replacing 3s with 3s, and 3s again, and 1s. But in the input, there's a 3 in row 6, so that's why it's appearing in the output.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell's value is the sum of its neighboring cells or something like that. For example, a cell with 2 becomes 2, but in the output, it's also 2. Hmm, no, that doesn't explain the changes in other cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell is the sum of its neighboring cells. For example, if a cell has 0, it remains 0. If a cell has 2, it might become 2, but perhaps other cells are being modified. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3, the input has 0s except for row 2 and row 6. The output shows that row 2 and row 6 have certain numbers. So maybe the rule is that each row is processed independently, and certain positions are being set based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about the number of 0s or 2s in each cell. For example, if a cell has a 2, it remains 2, but if it has more than 2, it's split into smaller numbers.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output has 8 in the middle, which is the same as the input. So perhaps when a cell has an 8, it remains 8. But in Example 2, the output for row 12 has 3, which was present in the input. So maybe the rule is that each cell is replaced by the sum of its neighboring cells. Let me test that.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's second row, which has a 0 in the middle, surrounded by 2s. If each cell is the sum of its neighbors, then the middle cell would be 2 + 2 = 4, but the output has 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of 0s or 2s in the row. For example, if a row has a 2, it remains 2. If it has a 0, it remains 0. But in Example 2, the row with 3 becomes 3, and another row with 8 becomes 8, but in the output, there are 3s and 1s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the sum of its adjacent cells divided by 2. For example, if a cell has a 0, it remains 0. If a cell has a 2, it becomes 1, but in the output, it's still 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is about the number of times a digit appears in the input. For example, if a cell has a 2, it remains 2. If it has a 3, it becomes 3, etc. But in Example 2, the 3 becomes 3 in the output, which matches, but the 8 becomes 8, also matching.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output has 5 and 8, which aren't present in the input. So perhaps the rule is more complex.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell's value is the sum of its neighboring cells, but only if the sum is greater than 2. For example, if a cell has 0, it remains 0. If it has 2, it remains 2. If it has 3, it becomes 3. If it has 8, it remains 8. If it has 5, it becomes 5. But that doesn't explain the changes in other cells.\n\nWait, looking at the examples, the output seems to have numbers that are either 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8. In the first example, the output has 8, which is the only non-zero number. In the second example, the output has 3s and 1s. In the third example, the output has 5s, 8s, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is replaced by its value if it's greater than 2, otherwise it remains 0. But in Example 2, the output for row 12 has 3, which was present in the input. Similarly, row 2 has 3, and row 12 has 1, which wasn't present in the input. Wait, but in Example 2, the input has a 3 in row 2, and the output has 3 in row 12. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the 0s and 2s are preserved, and other numbers are converted to 0s. But in Example 2, the output has 3s and 1s, which aren't 0s or 2s. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the number of times a cell's value exceeds 2. For example, if a cell has a 2, it remains 2. If it has a 3, it becomes 3. If it has a 5, it becomes 5. If it has an 8, it remains 8. But in Example 3, the output has 5s and 8s, which were present in the input. So perhaps that's the rule.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output has 8, which was also present in the input. So maybe the rule is that any number greater than 2 is kept as is, and 0s and 2s are left as they are. But in Example 2, the output has 3s and 1s, which weren't present in the input. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is replaced by the sum of its neighboring cells. For example, if a cell has a 0, it remains 0. If it has a 2, it might become 2. If it has a 3, it might become 3. But in Example 3, the 5s are in the output, which was present in the input.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has 8 in the middle, which was present in the input. So maybe numbers greater than 2 are kept, but numbers less than or equal to 2 are reduced. But then, in Example 2, the 3 in row 2 remains 3, which fits. The 3 in row 12 remains 3, which matches the output. The 8 in row 12 remains 8.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 5s and 8s, which were present in the input. So maybe the rule is that any number greater than 2 is kept, and other numbers are converted to 2 or 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has 2 in the middle, which was in the input. So maybe it's a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is replaced by the digit sum of its neighboring cells divided by 2. For example, if a cell has a 2, it might become 1. But in Example 2, the output has 3, which wasn't present in the input.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell is replaced by the sum of its adjacent cells divided by 2, but only if the result is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, it's set to 0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is replaced by the number of times its neighboring cells have a value greater than 2. For example, if a cell has a 3, it would be replaced by 1 (since it's greater than 2). But in Example 2, the 3 remains 3.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a pattern by looking at the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a single 2 in the middle, and the output has that 2 in the middle, which matches. The surrounding zeros are preserved. So maybe the rule is that any cell with a 2 remains 2, and other cells are set to 0.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output has 3s and 1s. So perhaps when a cell has a 3, it remains 3, and when it has a 1, it becomes 1. But in the input, the 3 is in row 2, and the output also has 3 in row 12. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s remain 5, and the 8 remains 8. So perhaps any number greater than 2 is kept as is, and numbers less than or equal to 2 are reduced to 2.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 2 remains 2, which fits. In Example 2, the 3 remains 3, which fits. In Example 3, the 5 and 8 remain as is.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the output has 1s where the input doesn't have 0s. For example, in row 12, the output has 1 where the input has 0. So maybe the rule is that any cell with a value greater than 2 is kept, and other cells are set to 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has 2 in the middle, which was present. So maybe the rule is that any cell with a 2 remains 2, and other cells are set to 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output has 3s and 1s. So perhaps the rule is that any cell with a number greater than 2 is kept, and others are reduced to 2 or 0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is replaced by the sum of its adjacent cells divided by 2, but only if the result is greater than 2. Otherwise, it's set to 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply that.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell's value is the sum of its neighboring cells, but only if the sum is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, it's set to 0.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 surrounded by 0s. So the middle cell would be 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which is greater than or equal to 2, so it remains 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s. So each 3 would be the sum of its neighbors. For example, in row 2, the 3 is surrounded by 2s. So the sum would be 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, which is greater than 2, so it remains 3.\n\nWait, but in the output, row 2 has a 3, which fits. Similarly, the 3 in row 12 would be surrounded by 2s, so the sum would be 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, which is greater than 2, so it remains 3. But in the output, row 12 has a 3, which fits.\n\nSimilarly, the 5s in the input remain 5, and the 8 remains 8.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s remain 5, which fits. The 8 remains 8.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 0s except for row 2, which has 0, and row 5, which has a 0. The output has 0s everywhere except row 2 and row 5, which have 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, that seems inconsistent with the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when a cell has a value greater than 2, it remains as is, otherwise, it's set to 0. But that doesn't explain the changes in Example 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is the sum of its adjacent cells divided by 2, but only if the result is greater than 2. Otherwise, it's set to 0.\n\nLet me try that with Example 1. Suppose the input is a single 2 in the middle. The middle cell's value would be (0 + 2 + 0)/2 = 1, but the output has 2, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the rule is that each cell is replaced by the number of times its neighboring cells have a value greater than 2. For example, if a cell has a 3, it might be replaced by 1, since it's greater than 2. If it has a 5, it might be replaced by 2, etc. But then, in Example 2, the 3 would remain 3, the 3 in row 2 would remain 3, and the 3 in row 12 would remain 3. Similarly, the 5s would remain 5.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the 5s remain 5, which fits. The 8s remain 8.\n\nIn Example 4, the input is a 0 except for row 2 and row 5, which have 0 and 0. The output has 0s everywhere except row 2 and row 5, which have 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So it seems that in rows where there were 0s in the input, they remain 0. But rows that had 3s have 3s. So perhaps the rule is that any cell with a value greater than 2 is kept as is, otherwise 0.\n\nThat would fit all examples. So, in the first example, the middle cell is 2, which is kept. The surrounding cells are 0, which are kept.", -0.25]]}
