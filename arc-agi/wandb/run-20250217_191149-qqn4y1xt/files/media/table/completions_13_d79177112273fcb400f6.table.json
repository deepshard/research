Let me start by looking at the examples given to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a mix of zeros and some numbers. The output grid seems to have a lot of zeros, mostly except for the first few rows. Noticing that the output has non-zero values only in the first nine rows where some of the cells have numbers like 7, 6, 9, 8, etc. I'm guessing the rule is something about the sum or count of certain elements in each row or column.\n\nMaybe I should check the input rows to see how they transform into the output. Let's take a closer look at the first few rows.\n\nIn the input, the first row is all zeros, and the output is also all zeros. The second row in input has a 7, 6, 0, etc. In the output, the second row has 0s except for a 7 in the first position. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, maybe it's something about the sum of the elements in each row. Let me calculate the sum for the first row. All zeros, so that's 0. The second row has 0, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Sum is 7 + 6 = 13. The output for the first position is 0, but the output for the second position is 7, which is the first element of the second row. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of non-zero elements in each row. Let's see. The second row has 2 non-zero elements, and the output for the first position is 7. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps it's about the sum of the first and last elements in each row. Let me check. For the second row, first element is 0, last is 0, sum is 0, but output is 7. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the even-indexed elements. Let's see. For the second row, indexes are 0-based, so 0,1,2, etc. Even indices are 0 and 2. First element is 0, second is 7. Sum is 7, which matches the output's first position. Then index 1 is 6, which is even? No, index 1 is odd. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the sum of all elements in each row. The second row sum is 13, and the output's first element is 7, which is less than 13. Doesn't seem to fit.\n\nLet me look at Example 2 now. The input and output grids are more complex, with varying numbers of non-zero elements. The output seems to have a pattern where in certain rows, the non-zero elements are shifted to the left or something.\n\nLooking at the output, the first element is non-zero in most rows, except the last few. For example, the last row of output is all zeros. The first row of output has 0s, except maybe the first element. Wait, no, first row of output is all zeros except the last few.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the second row of output has 7,7,0,... which might correspond to the first two non-zero elements being 7,7, and so on.\n\nSo maybe in the output, each row has non-zero elements starting from the first position, but the number depends on the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the number of non-zero elements in each row of the input and then placing those in the output in a certain way.\n\nWait, let's take the first row of Example 2. Input has all zeros, so output is all zeros.\n\nSecond row of input: 0,8,8,0,... Sum is 16. Output's second row has 7,7,0,... Maybe it's half of the sum, but 16/2=8, but the output is 7,7 which sums to 14, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's half the number of non-zero elements. For the second row, input has two non-zero elements (positions 1 and 2). So output's second position is 7, which is 7, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is a cumulative sum of the input, but that seems unlikely since the first row is all zeros.\n\nWait, maybe the output is derived by taking the number of consecutive non-zero elements from the left in each row of the input. For example, in Example 2, the second row has two non-zero elements in a row, so the output for that position is 7,7 (perhaps 7 is the count multiplied by something).\n\nBut in Example 1, the second row of output is 0,0,0,0,0,7,6,... which doesn't fit a count.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should look for how the output is constructed row by row.\n\nLooking at the first row of Output in Example 1: it's all zeros. The first row of Input is all zeros. So maybe the rule is about the sum of the row in the input and how it affects the output.\n\nWait, in the first row of Output, all zeros, but Input row is all zeros, so sum is 0. Output row is 0s. Maybe that's a base case.\n\nFor the second row of Output, the output is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Wait, no, that's not right. The second Output row in Example 1 is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Wait, no, the output in Example 1 is:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 4\n\nWait, the fifth row of Output is 0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0. So in the fifth row of Input, which is 0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0. So the sum of the non-zero elements is 8+8=16. But in the Output, the fifth row is 0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0. So 7+6=13, less than 16.\n\nWait, maybe it's not about sum. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of non-zero elements. Input has two non-zero elements, but Output has 7+6=13, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the positions of the non-zero elements. For example, in the Input's fifth row, the non-zero elements are at positions 5 and 6 (0-based). In the Output's fifth row, non-zero elements are at 4 and 5. Maybe shifting left by one, but not sure.\n\nWait, in the Output's fifth row, the non-zero elements are at positions 4 and 5, which are the same as the Input's non-zero elements at positions 5 and 6. So maybe the non-zero elements in the Input are shifted to the left by one in the Output.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis. Let's take the first Input row: all zeros. Output row is all zeros. If shifted left by one, it's still all zeros. That fits.\n\nSecond row of Input: 0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. If shifted left by one, it would be 0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0, but Output's second row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not a left shift. Alternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements are being replaced with some other values. Like, in Input's second row, 7 and 6 become 0 and 0 in some positions.\n\nWait, in Output's second row, the non-zero elements are 7 and 6, but in the Input's second row, they are at positions 1 and 2. So maybe they are being replaced with 0 and 0. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about the number of non-zero elements. Let me see.\n\nIn the Input's second row, there are two non-zero elements (7 and 6). In the Output's second row, there are two non-zero elements (7 and 6) at the ends. So maybe the rule is that the number of non-zero elements remains the same, but their positions change.\n\nWait, but in the Output's fifth row, there are two non-zero elements, same as Input's fourth row, which had two non-zero elements. So maybe the rule is about the count of non-zero elements and their positions, but not their actual values.\n\nWait, but in the Output's second row, the non-zero elements are 7 and 6, which are the same as Input's second row. So maybe the rule is that the non-zero elements are being replaced with 0 and 0. Wait, but that would make sense for the second row.\n\nWait, let's test this. If non-zero elements are replaced with 0, then in the fifth row, Input's non-zero elements are at positions 5 and 6, which become 0 and 0 in Output's fifth row, which matches. Similarly, in the fourth row, Input had non-zero elements at positions 1 and 2, which become 0 and 0 in Output's fourth row. Wait, but Output's fourth row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in the third row of Output, the non-zero elements are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sixth row of Output, which is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Input's sixth row has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that fits.\n\nNow, let's check the seventh row of Output, which is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Input's seventh row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that fits.\n\nThe eighth row of Output is all zeros, same as Input's eighth row, which is 0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Output's eighth row is all zeros. That fits.\n\nThe ninth row of Output is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Input's ninth row is 0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Output's ninth row is all zeros. That fits.\n\nThe tenth row of Output is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Input's tenth row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Output's tenth row is all zeros. That fits.\n\nThe eleventh row of Output is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Input's eleventh row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Output's eleventh row is all zeros. That fits.\n\nThe twelfth row of Output is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Input's twelfth row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Output's twelfth row is all zeros. That fits.\n\nThe thirteenth row of Output is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Input's thirteenth row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Output's thirteenth row is all zeros. That fits.\n\nWait, but in the fourth row of Output, it's 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Input's fourth row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that fits.\n\nBut wait, in the fifth row of Output, it's 0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0. Input's fifth row is 0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0. So the non-zero elements are 8 and 8, but in the Output, they are 7 and 6. So maybe the non-zero elements are decreasing by 1 each time? 8 becomes 7, 8 becomes 6. That's possible.\n\nLet me check other rows. In the sixth row of Input, the non-zero elements are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Wait, no, in Example 2, the sixth row of Input is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So Output's sixth row is all zeros. That fits.\n\nWait, but in the third row of Output, it's 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Input's third row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that fits.\n\nBut in the fifth row of Output, the non-zero elements are 7 and 6, which are one less than the Input's non-zero elements. So that seems like a pattern.\n\nWait, but in the fourth row of Output, it's all zeros, but Input's fourth row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in the seventh row of Output, it's all zeros, and Input's seventh row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that fits.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each row, take the non-zero elements, replace them with a sequence of numbers starting from a certain number, and then adjust their values based on their position.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think. In the fifth row of Output, the non-zero elements are 7 and 6. Maybe they are being shifted left by one, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in each row, the non-zero elements are replaced with a sequence that starts from the number of non-zero elements in the next row and decreases by one each time.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see if this holds.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row of Input has non-zero elements at positions 5 and 6 (0-based), so two non-zero elements. So the next row has non-zero elements at positions 3 and 4, which would be 0 and 0. But in the Output, the fifth row is 0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0. So non-zero elements are at positions 5 and 6, which are 7 and 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of non-zero elements. Let's see.\n\nIn Input row 2: 0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Number of non-zero elements: 2.\n\nIn Output row 2: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Zero non-zero elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to think differently.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the fifth row of Output has non-zero elements at positions 5 and 6. In the Input's fifth row, those are 8 and 8. So perhaps it's being reduced by 1 each time.\n\nSimilarly, in the fourth row of Output, it's all zeros, which corresponds to the fourth row of Input being all zeros.\n\nWait, but then the seventh row of Output is all zeros, same as the seventh row of Input.\n\nHmm, let me check another row. The sixth row of Input is all zeros, so Output's sixth row is all zeros. That fits.\n\nThe third row of Output is all zeros, same as the third row of Input.\n\nWait, but in the sixth row of Output, it's 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Input's sixth row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in Input's fourth row, the non-zero elements are at positions 1 and 2, which become 0 and 0 in Output's fourth row. That fits.\n\nIn the fifth row, non-zero elements at positions 5 and 6 become 7 and 6, which fits the pattern of decreasing by one.\n\nWait, but then in the second row, non-zero elements at positions 1 and 2 become 0 and 0, which is consistent with non-zero elements being replaced by zeros.\n\nWait, but in the sixth row, non-zero elements are at positions 5 and 6, which become 7 and 6, which is consistent with the fifth row being 7 and 6.\n\nWait, so the rule seems to be: for each row, take the non-zero elements, replace them with a sequence of numbers starting from some base and decreasing by one each time.\n\nBut how do we determine the base? It seems like the base is determined by the row below.\n\nWait, perhaps the base is the number of non-zero elements", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 4\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided to identify patterns.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has a mix of zeros and numbers, with some rows having 7s, 6s, 9s, and 8s. The output grid also shows a lot of zeros, but some non-zero values are shifted to specific positions.\n\nLooking at the first few rows of both input and output grids, I notice that the non-zero numbers in the input are moving to different columns in the output. For example, the 7 in the second row of the first input row moves to a different position in the output grid.\n\nAnother observation is that the number of zeros in the output seems to decrease when the input has some non-zero numbers. This suggests that the transformation involves reducing the zero count in some rows.\n\nI also notice that certain positions in the output grid remain zero, regardless of the input. These positions are likely where the non-zero numbers from the input have been moved to.\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I hypothesize that the rule involves identifying the positions of the highest non-zero numbers in each row and moving them to specific columns in the output grid. This could mean that in each row, the highest number is identified, and its position is used to determine where it moves to in the output.\n\nTesting this hypothesis against the examples, it seems to hold. The highest non-zero numbers in each input row are moved to the corresponding positions in the output grid, while other zeros remain in their places.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input grid provided, I can predict the output grid by identifying the highest non-zero numbers in each row and their respective positions, then mapping them accordingly.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 4\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples given are quite lengthy, so I need to look for a pattern or rule that transforms the input into the output. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the examples provided. In Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and a few numbers. The output seems to have a specific pattern where some zeros are replaced by non-zero values, but not all. For instance, in the first input row, all zeros remain zero, but in the output, the second row has non-zero values. It looks like the rule involves some kind of transformation or operation that affects certain cells based on their neighbors or positions.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again, the input grid is 11 rows by 10 columns. The output grid is also 11 rows but some rows have entirely zeros. This suggests that the rule might be based on certain conditions that result in the output having zeros in some cells. Maybe the rule is that if certain cells meet a condition, they stay zero; otherwise, they transform into the non-zero values.\n\nI notice that in the input, some rows have 8s and 0s, while others have 7s, 6s, 9s, and 4s. The output seems to have more 7s, 6s, and 9s, but zeros where there were zeros in the input. This makes me think that the rule might involve moving values from certain positions to others based on some rule, perhaps like shifting or swapping.\n\nAnother observation is that the rule might involve the sum of certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the second row in the input becomes the second row in the output, but with non-zero values. This might indicate that the rule affects the middle rows, keeping them as they are or transforming them based on the values in their vicinity.\n\nLet me try to think of possible operations. Maybe it's a transposition, where rows become columns or something like that. Or perhaps it's a rotation or reflection of the grid. But looking at the examples, it seems more like a transformation based on specific conditions rather than just shifting.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule involves the presence of certain numbers in specific cells. For example, if a cell has a 7, it stays 7; if it has a 6, it stays 6, and so on. But that doesn't fit the output because the output has 7s and 6s as well. Maybe the rule is more about moving values from certain cells to others based on some condition.\n\nLooking closer, I notice that in the output grids, the non-zero values are sometimes in the same relative positions as in the input but perhaps shifted. For example, in the first example, the 7 and 6 in the second row become 0 and 0 in the fourth row, and then they appear again later. This suggests that the rule might involve some kind of propagation or transformation that affects specific cells.\n\nAnother idea is that the rule might involve the sum of each row or column. For instance, if the sum of a row in the input is above a certain threshold, the corresponding cells in the output are set to non-zero values. But in the examples, the output has non-zero values in specific positions, not just based on sums.\n\nI'm starting to think that the rule might involve the presence of a particular number in certain cells, and based on that, the corresponding cells in the output are transformed. For example, if a cell has a 7, it stays 7; if it has a 6, it stays 6, etc. But again, the output has non-zero values in some cells that weren't in the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in each row or column. If a row has more non-zero elements, the corresponding cells in the output are zeroed out. But in Example 1, the output has a row with only zeros, which suggests that this isn't the case.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the output grids and see how they are constructed. For instance, in the first output grid after Example 1, the second row has 0s and then some non-zero values. This might indicate that the rule affects the middle rows, keeping them as they are or transforming them.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the non-zero values. For example, in Example 1, the non-zero values are 7, 6, 9, and 4. These numbers don't seem to follow a particular mathematical pattern, but perhaps they are related to the positions of the cells or some operation involving their indices.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is about the position of the non-zero values. For example, if a cell is in an even position, it becomes non-zero, and if it's in an odd position, it remains zero. But that doesn't fit because in Example 1, some non-zero values are in odd positions and others in even positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves the sum of the digits of the numbers in certain cells. For example, if a cell has a 7, the sum of its digits is 7, so it remains 7. Similarly, a 6 remains 6. But again, the output has non-zero values in some cells that weren't in the input.\n\nI think I need to try a different approach. Let me consider each cell in the input grid and see what it maps to in the output grid. For example, the first cell in the first row is 0, and it remains 0 in the output. The next cell is 0, which also remains 0. The third cell is 0, same as before. The fourth cell is 0, same as before. The fifth cell is 0, same as before. The sixth cell is 0, same as before. The seventh cell is 0, same as before. The eighth cell is 0, same as before. The ninth cell is 0, same as before. The tenth cell is 0, same as before. So, in the first row, all cells remain zero.\n\nMoving to the second row in Example 1, the input has 0, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The output has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, that can't be right because the output actually has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 again in the first row, but in the second row, the output has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So, maybe the rule is that if the input has a non-zero value in a certain position, the output in that position remains non-zero, but in the given example, all non-zero values in the input end up being zero in the output. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again. In Example 1, the input is a 11x10 grid. The output is also a 11x10 grid. Looking at the first row of the output, it's all zeros. The second row in the output is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, that can't be right because the input has 7 and 6 in the second row. So, the output has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 for the second row. That doesn't make sense because the input had 7 and 6 in the second row, which should be in the output as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows. Let me look again. The input grid is 11x10, so 11 rows and 10 columns. The output grid is also 11 rows, each with 10 columns. So, in the output, the second row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. That suggests that all non-zero values in the input have been transformed into zeros in the output. But that can't be right because the output should have some non-zero values as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that if a cell is in an even row, it remains zero, and if it's in an odd row, it remains non-zero. But in Example 1, the output has 0s in some rows and non-zeroes in others. Let me check the output grids again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output grid has 0s in the first and fourth rows, and non-zeroes in the other rows. Wait, no, looking at the output, the first row is all zeros, the second row is 0s and then 0s, and the third row is 0s and then 0s. Wait, no, looking closer, in the output, the first row is all zeros, the second row has 0s and 0s, the third row has 0s and 0s, and the fourth row is 0s and 0s. Wait, no, looking at the output, the first row is all zeros, the second row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The third row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The fourth row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The fifth row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The sixth row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The seventh row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The eighth row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The ninth row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The tenth row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The eleventh row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.\n\nWait, so in the output, all the rows except the first have all zeros. But in the input, the second row has 7 and 6, and the fifth row has 8, 8, and 8. So, how does this fit? If the rule is that in even rows, the cells are zero, and in odd rows, they are non-zero, then the second row would have all zeros, and the fifth row would have 7, 6, and 8. But in the output, the fifth row is all zeros, which contradicts this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that in even rows, the cells are zero, and in odd rows, the cells are non-zero. But in the output, the fifth row has all zeros, which would mean that it's an even row, which contradicts because 5 is odd. So this can't be the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in even-numbered rows, the cells are zero, and in odd-numbered rows, the cells are non-zero. But in Example 1, the output has all rows except the first one as all zeros, which would mean that all rows are even-numbered, which is impossible because the first row is odd. So this can't be the rule either.\n\nI'm clearly missing something. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule isn't about the position but about the value of the cells themselves. For example, if a cell has a value of 7, it remains 7; if it has 6, it remains 6; if it has 9, it remains 9; and if it has 4, it remains 4. But this doesn't explain why the output has non-zero values in some cells that weren't in the input.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2, the input has several non-zero values, and the output has more non-zero values. For example, the second row in Example 2 has 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The output has 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. This suggests that the rule isn't simply replacing non-zero values with zeros.\n\nWait, maybe the rule involves the sum of the digits of the non-zero values. For example, if a cell has a 7, it remains 7; if it has 8, it remains 8; if it has 9, it remains 9; and if it has 4, it remains 4. But in Example 1, the output has non-zero values in cells that were zero in the input. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that non-zero values are kept, and zeros are replaced with zeros based on some condition. But in Example 1, the output has all zeros in the first row, which would suggest that all non-zero values in the input are replaced with zeros, which contradicts the presence of 7 and 6 in the input.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if a cell has a value greater than or equal to 7, it remains non-zero; otherwise, it becomes zero. But in Example 1, the output has non-zero values in cells that were zero in the input, which contradicts this.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look at the second example and see if I can find a pattern there. In Example 2, the input has non-zero values in certain rows, and the output has non-zero values in different positions. For example, the second row in the output has 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, which means that the cells that were zero in the input (second row) now have 7s. This suggests that the rule involves moving non-zero values from certain positions to others.\n\nBut how exactly? Let me look at the input and output grids again. In Example 2, the input has a row with 8, 8, 8 in the fifth row. The output has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So, perhaps the rule is that if a cell has a value >= 8, it remains non-zero; otherwise, it becomes zero. But in the output, the fifth row has all zeros, which would mean that the 8s were in the input but were replaced with zeros. This doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that non-zero values are kept, and zeros are replaced with zeros based on some condition. But in Example 2, the output has non-zero values in cells that were zero in the input. That would mean that the rule replaces zeros with non-zero values, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if a cell has a value of 0, it becomes non-zero, and if it has a non-zero value, it remains non-zero. But in Example 1, the output has all zeros in the first row, which suggests that all non-zero values in the input are replaced with zeros, which conflicts with the presence of 7 and 6 in the input.\n\nI'm really not making progress here. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the rule involves the position of the cells. For example, if a cell is in an even position, it's replaced with zero, and if it's in an odd position, it remains non-zero. But in Example 1, the output has all rows except the first one as all zeros, which would mean that all rows are odd-numbered, which is impossible because the first row is odd, and the second row is even.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that cells in even columns are zeroed out, and cells in odd columns remain non-zero. But in Example 1, the output has all columns as zeros, which would mean that all columns are even, which is impossible because the first row has a non-zero value in column 3.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if a cell has a value of 0, it remains zero; else, it's transformed into a specific value based on some condition. For example, if the cell is in an even position, it's set to 7; if it's in an odd position, it's set to 6. But in Example 1, the output has 7s and 6s in some cells, which fits this pattern. Let's test this idea.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has zeros and 7s and 6s. The rule would transform even-positioned cells to 7 and odd-positioned cells to 6. Let's see if this matches the output. The first row of the output is all zeros, which suggests that all even-positioned cells were zero and remained zero, but the odd-positioned cells were 7s. However, in the input, the second row has 7 and 6 in columns 3 and 4. If even columns are 7 and odd columns are 6, then in the second row, columns 3 and 4 would be 7 and 6, which matches the output. Similarly, in the fifth row, columns 3 and 4 would be 7 and 6, which matches the output. The other even-positioned cells would be 7, which in the output would stay 7, and the odd-positioned cells would be 6, which would stay 6. So, this seems to fit.\n\nBut let me check the second row of the output. It's 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, no, looking at the output, the second row is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So, all cells in the second row are zero. If the rule is that even columns are 7 and odd columns are 6, then in the second row, columns 1", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 4\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are two examples provided, so I'll start by looking at those closely to see if I can figure out what's happening.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid is a 11x10 matrix filled mostly with zeros and a few non-zero entries. The output grid is similar but has some different non-zero values. For instance, in the output, there are entries like 7, 6, 9, and 4. I need to figure out why these numbers appear in the output.\n\nLet me compare the input and output grids. In the first few rows of the input, there are zeros, and in the output, the non-zero entries are in different positions. The first non-zero in the output is 7, which was previously 0 in the input. Similarly, 6, 9, and 4 appear elsewhere. It seems like the rule is about transforming the input values based on some condition.\n\nI notice that in the input, there are some rows with 8s and 0s. For example, the second row has 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0. In the output, it becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the transformation. Let me check another part.\n\nIn the fourth row of the input, all zeros, and the output is also zeros. The fifth row has 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0, which becomes 0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0. So, 8s become 7 and 6. Hmm, that's interesting. It seems like when a 8 appears, it's being reduced to 7 or 6.\n\nLooking further, the seventh row in the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but in the output, it remains zeros. The tenth row in the input has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, and the output is also zeros. The twelfth row in the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, and the output is zeros. So, 8s are transformed to 7 and 6, but elsewhere, there are 0s that remain the same.\n\nI think the rule is that any non-zero value in the input is transformed based on some condition. Maybe it's related to the position or the value itself. Let me look at the second row again: 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So, this row becomes all zeros. That's unusual. Maybe the rule is that if a certain condition is met, the non-zero values are transformed, otherwise, they stay zero.\n\nLooking at the fourth row, which is all zeros, it remains all zeros. The fifth row, which has two 8s, becomes 0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0. So, the two 8s are transformed into 7 and 6. Maybe when two 8s are adjacent, they are reduced by their sum or something.\n\nWait, 8 is a high value, and 7 and 6 are lower. Maybe it's about subtracting a certain number. If I subtract 1 from each 8, I get 7, but in the output, it's 7 and 6. Alternatively, maybe it's about removing the last digit or something, but 8 is two digits, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the rule is that any non-zero value is divided by 2, but 8 divided by 2 is 4, not 7 or 6. So that can't be it. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the sum of adjacent cells or something else.\n\nLooking at Example 2, perhaps I can get more insight. The input has some 8s and 7s, and the output has 7s, 6s, 4s, and 0s. For example, the first row of the input is all zeros, and the output is zeros. The second row has 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0, which becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The third row has 0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0, which becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The fourth row is zeros, output is zeros. The fifth row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0, which becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The sixth row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0, which becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The seventh row is zeros, output is zeros. The eighth row has 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0, output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The ninth row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The tenth row is zeros, output is zeros. The twelfth row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, output is zeros.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the fifth row in the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which is the same as the input. That's confusing. Maybe I need to check the exact transformations.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLooking at the second row of the input, which is 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Hmm, that's strange. The two 8s are transformed into zeros. But in the output, the second row is all zeros. So maybe whenever a row has two 8s or something, it becomes all zeros.\n\nWait, in the first row of the input, it's all zeros, and the output is all zeros. The second row, with two 8s, becomes all zeros. The third row, with three 8s, becomes all zeros. The fourth row is zeros, output is zeros. The fifth row is zeros, output is zeros. The sixth row, which has 7s, becomes zeros. The seventh row, 6s, becomes zeros. The eighth row, 8s, becomes zeros. The ninth row is zeros, output is zeros. The tenth row is zeros. The twelfth row is zeros.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that any row containing at least two 8s is transformed into a row of all zeros. Otherwise, the values remain as they are.\n\nWait, but looking at the second row of the input, which is 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0, if it had two 8s, it would become all zeros. But in the output, it's all zeros. The same applies to the third row, which has three 8s, and the sixth row has 7s, which are reduced to zeros.\n\nBut what about rows without multiple 8s? For example, in the second row, after the two 8s, there are zeros, but it remains zeros. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe any row that contains an 8 is transformed into zeros, regardless of the number of 8s.\n\nBut in that case, the first row, which is all zeros, remains all zeros. So, maybe the rule is that any row that contains an 8 is transformed into a row of all zeros. Otherwise, the values remain as they are.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the sixth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0, which becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So, even though it has 7s, it's transformed into zeros. Similarly, the seventh row has 6s, which becomes zeros.\n\nSo, maybe the rule is that any row containing at least one non-zero value is transformed into a row of all zeros, except for specific cases where the non-zero values are reduced.\n\nWait, but in the fifth row of the input, which is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which is all zeros. So, even with 8s, it's transformed into zeros. Similarly, in the sixth row, the two 7s are transformed into zeros.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is based on whether the row has at least one non-zero value. If it does, it's transformed into a row of all zeros. Otherwise, the row remains as it is.\n\nWait, but in the fourth row of the input, which is all zeros, the output is all zeros. So, the rule is that any row with any non-zero value is transformed into a row of all zeros. Rows with all zeros remain as zeros.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the fifth row is all zeros, and the output is all zeros. The sixth row has non-zero values (7s), but the output is zeros. So, it seems consistent.\n\nBut in Example 1, the fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0, which in the output remains 0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0. So, the 8s are transformed into 7 and 6, which suggests that the rule is not simply transforming any non-zero into zeros, but perhaps more nuanced.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any non-zero value is divided by 2, but in the first example, 8 becomes 7 and 6, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the number of adjacent non-zero values or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced by the sum of its adjacent cells or something. But in the first example, the fifth row has two 8s, and the output has 7 and 6, which doesn't directly relate to the 8s.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of trailing zeros. For example, in the first example, the fifth row has 8s followed by zeros, but in the output, they are transformed into 7 and 6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced by the number of trailing zeros after it. For example, 8 has one trailing zero, but in the output, it's 7. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about subtracting a certain value. For example, 8 minus 1 is 7, and 8 minus 2 is 6. So, in the fifth row, the two 8s become 7 and 6. That seems to be a possible rule.\n\nLet me test this with other examples. In Example 2, the sixth row has 7s, which become zeros. So, if the rule is subtracting a certain number, 7 would have to be reduced to zero. That would require subtracting 7, but in the fifth row, it's subtracting 1. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about the number of digits. For example, 8 is a two-digit number, but in the output, it's converted into 7, which is one digit. That doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the sum of the digits. 8 is 8, but in the output, it's 7 or 6, which are lower. So, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the position of the non-zero values. For example, if a non-zero is in a certain position, it's replaced by another value. But without more data, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach is to look for patterns in the transformation. Let's take the fifth row of Example 1: 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0. So, the two 8s are transformed into 7 and 6. Let's see if 8 minus 1 is 7 and 8 minus 2 is 6. Maybe subtracting 1 and 2 respectively. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced by the number of trailing zeros it has plus one. For example, 8 has one trailing zero, so it becomes 2, but that doesn't fit the output.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the number of digits. 8 is a single-digit number, but in the output, it's a two-digit number. That doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced by the count of non-zero values to its right. For example, in the fifth row, the two 8s have one non-zero to their right, so they become 1 each? But in the output, they are 7 and 6, which doesn't fit.\n\nI'm not making progress with this line of thinking. Maybe I need to look at another part, like Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the sixth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0, which becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So, the two 7s are transformed into zeros. Similarly, in the seventh row, 6s become zeros, and the eighth row, 8s become zeros. In the fifth row, all zeros remain zeros.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that any row containing at least one non-zero value is transformed into a row of all zeros. Rows with all zeros remain as zeros.\n\nBut in Example 1, the fifth row has non-zero values, so it should become zeros. But in the output, it's 0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0. Wait, that's inconsistent with the rule I'm considering. So, maybe the rule isn't that simple.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any row with at least one non-zero value is transformed into a row where each non-zero value is replaced by a certain pattern, but in the examples, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is about the specific position of non-zero values. For example, if a non-zero is in a certain position, it's replaced by another value.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule is about the sum of the digits in the row. For example, 8 has a digit sum of 8, but in the output, it's 7 or 6, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of times a certain digit appears. For example, 8 appears twice in the fifth row, and it's transformed into 7 and 6. That seems possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that any row containing at least two instances of a certain digit is transformed into a row where each occurrence is replaced by a specific value.\n\nBut in Example 1, the fifth row has two 8s, and the output has 7 and 6. So, maybe each 8 is replaced by 7 and 6, in some order. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any non-zero digit is transformed into the digit minus 1, except for 0, which remains 0.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row's two 8s would become 7 and 7. But in the output, they are 7 and 6. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in the second row of Example 1, the two 8s become 0 and 0. If the rule is that any non-zero digit is transformed into 0, then that would fit. So, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero digit is replaced by 0, regardless of its value.\n\nBut in Example 2, the sixth row has 7s, which become 0. The seventh row has 6s, which become 0.

Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and a few non-zero numbers. The output seems to have zeros everywhere except in certain rows. For example, the fifth row in the input has two 8s, and in the output, those 8s become 7s. Similarly, in the sixth row, two 8s become 9s. Also, there's a row in the output that has 7s in the middle. This suggests that maybe the non-zero values are being reduced based on some rule.\n\nLooking at another part of Example 1, the seventh row in the input is all zeros, so the output is also zeros. The eighth and ninth rows are all zeros, so the output remains zeros. The tenth row has two 0s and two 8s, which become 0s and 7s. The eleventh row has 0s and multiple 0s, so it remains zero. The twelfth row has 8s and 8s, which become 7s and 6s. The thirteenth row is all zeros. The fourteenth row has 0s and 0s, which remain zero. The fifteenth row has 0s and 8s which become 9s. The sixteenth row is all zeros. The seventeenth row has 0s and 0s. The eighteenth row has 0s and 0s. The nineteenth row has 0s, 0s, and 0s. The twentieth row is all zeros.\n\nLooking at these changes, I notice that when there are two non-zero numbers in a row, they seem to be replaced by a single number. For example, in the fifth row of Example 1, two 8s become a 7, which is one less. Similarly, two 8s in the sixth row become a 9, which is one more. This suggests that the rule might involve subtracting one from the non-zero value.\n\nBut wait, in the fifth row, it's 8 becoming 7, and in the sixth row, 8 becomes 9. That's inconsistent. Maybe it's not a straightforward subtraction. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero value in the input is converted to a certain value in the output, but it's not clear yet.\n\nAnother observation is that the output grid has a lot of zeros, but only certain parts have non-zero values. The positions where the output has non-zero values seem to correspond to specific patterns in the input grid. For example, in the fifth row, the two 8s are in the middle, and they become 7s. In the sixth row, the two 8s are at the edges, and they become 9s. This might indicate that the non-zero values are in the middle or edges, and they are being converted to lower or higher values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves counting the number of non-zero elements in a row or column and applying a transformation based on that. For instance, if a row has two non-zero elements, perhaps the output reduces them to a single value. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nLet me look at Example 2 to see if the rule is consistent. In Example 2, the first row of the input is all zeros, so the output is zeros. The second row has 8s and 8s, which become 7s and 7s. The third row has more 8s, which become 6s and 6s. The fourth row is all zeros. The fifth row has 8s and 8s, which become 7s and 7s. The sixth row has 8s and 8s, which become 6s and 6s. The seventh row has 8s and 8s, which become 5s and 5s. The eighth row has 8s and 8s, which become 4s and 4s. The ninth row is all zeros. The tenth row has 0s and 8s, which become 7s and 7s. The eleventh row has 0s and 0s, so it remains zeros. The twelfth row has 0s and 0s, so it remains zeros. The thirteenth row is all zeros. The fourteenth row has 0s and 0s. The fifteenth row has 0s and 0s. The sixteenth row has 0s and 0s. The seventeenth row has 0s and 0s. The eighteenth row has 0s and 0s. The nineteenth row is all zeros. The twentieth row has 0s and 0s.\n\nThis is similar to Example 1, but the output values are different. In Example 1, some rows had 7s, 9s, and 6s, while in Example 2, some rows have 5s, 4s, and 7s. This suggests that the rule might involve different transformations based on the examples.\n\nGiven the similarity in the structure of the examples, I think the rule is that for each row, if there are two non-zero numbers, they are converted to a single number based on their value. For example, in Example 1, 8s become 7s and 9s, while in Example 2, 8s become 7s and 6s. This inconsistency complicates things.\n\nAnother approach is to look for patterns in the output grid compared to the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the two 8s become 7s, which is a decrease by 1, and the two 8s become 9s, which is an increase by 1. This suggests that the rule might depend on the position of the non-zero values. For instance, if the non-zero values are in specific positions, they might be converted differently.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could involve counting the number of non-zero elements in a row or column and applying a transformation based on that count. For example, if a row has an even number of non-zero elements, the output values are reduced by 1, and if it's odd, they are increased by 1. But without more data, it's hard to confirm.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I will proceed with the assumption that when a row in the input has two non-zero numbers, they are converted to a single number. The exact transformation (like subtracting or adding 1) depends on the examples provided. In Example 1, 8s become 7s and 9s, while in Example 2, 8s become 7s and 6s. This suggests that the transformation varies, but perhaps the rule is to subtract 1 when the non-zero value is 8 in certain positions and add 1 in others.\n\nHowever, without a clear pattern, it's challenging to determine the exact rule. Therefore, I will conclude that the rule involves converting two non-zero values in a row to a single value based on their value, with the transformation varying depending on the specific examples.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input would involve identifying rows with two non-zero values and converting them to a single value according to the observed pattern. For example, in the fifth row of the test input, two 8s become 7s, and in the sixth row, two 8s become 9s. The seventh row of the test input has 8s and 8s, which according to the pattern, would become 7s and 7s. Similarly, the twelfth row would have 8s and 8s, becoming 7s and 7s. The thirteenth row has 8s and 8s, which would also become 7s and 7s. The fourteenth row is all zeros, so it remains zero. The other rows with two non-zero values would also follow the pattern of converting them to 7s or remain zeros as observed.\n\nTherefore, the final output grid would have 7s where the input had two 8s, and zeros elsewhere, based on the consistent conversion observed in the examples.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 4\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's start by carefully examining both examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput Grid:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput Grid:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nI notice that in the first two lines of the output, all values are zero, which suggests that those rows might be completely unaffected by the transformation. The last line of the output changes some values from zero to 7 and 6, so that must be the rule.\n\nLooking closer, the non-zero rows seem to be reducing the values in a pattern. For instance, in the third line of the input, the values 9 and 4 become 7 and 6 in the output. Similarly, in the fourth row of the input, 8 and 8 become 7 and 6 in the output. This pattern suggests that each value in the output is the minimum of itself or the value in the corresponding position of the input grid.\n\nWait, let me check the first input line. All zeros remain zero, so the rule is probably not taking the minimum of itself and something else. Let me see other rows.\n\nIn the second input line, we have 7 and 6 in the output. The input has 7 and 6 there. So perhaps the rule is that each value is the minimum of itself and the input value.\n\nLooking at the third input line: 9 and 4 become 7 and 6. The minimum of 9 and 7 is 7, and the minimum of 4 and 6 is 4. But 4 doesn't become 6, so that might not be the rule.\n\nWait, maybe it's not the minimum. Let me think differently. Maybe it's the value that appears in the same column but in a row where the input is non-zero.\n\nLooking at the third row of the input, which is 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for this row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that suggests that if the input in some row has a non-zero, the output in that column for that row might be non-zero if it's influenced by the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output value is the minimum of the input value and the corresponding value in the previous row of the same column. Let me test this.\n\nIn example 1, the second row has 7 in the second column. The corresponding row in the previous row (first row) has 0 there. So the minimum is 0, which matches the output.\n\nThe third row in the input has 9 in the second column. The previous row (second) has 7, so the minimum is 7, which matches the output.\n\nThe fourth row in the input has 4 in the third column. The previous row (third) has 9, so the minimum is 4, but the output is 0. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the rule. Alternatively, perhaps it's the maximum of the input value and the value in the previous row. Let's see.\n\nIn example 1, second row has 7. The previous row has 0, so maximum is 7, which matches the output.\n\nThird row has 9. The previous row has 7, so maximum is 9, but the output is 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the value that appears in the same column but in the row where the input is non-zero. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the input rows, the second row has non-zero in column 2, third row non-zero in column 3, and others have non-zero in their respective columns.\n\nIn the output, the second row is all zeros, which suggests that any input with non-zero in column 2 becomes zero. Similarly, the third row is all zeros, meaning any non-zero in column 3 becomes zero. The fourth row is non-zero in column 4, which becomes 7, which is the value in the same column in the second row.\n\nWait, but the second row's second column is 7, so that's not zero. Maybe it's the value from the previous row's non-zero column.\n\nWait, in the input, the second row's second column is 7. The third row's second column is 9, which is higher than 7, so maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output value is the minimum of itself and the value from the row above in the same column.\n\nLet's test that:\n\nThird row has 9 in column 2. The row above (second row) has 7 in column 2. The minimum is 7, which is the output.\n\nFourth row has 4 in column 3. The row above (third) has 9, so the minimum is 4, but the output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output value is the minimum of the input value and the value from the left in the same row.\n\nLooking at the third row, which has 0s except for 9 in column 3. The left value is 6, so 9 is larger, so output is 0.\n\nWait, but the output is 0, so maybe if the left value is non-zero, it's considered. Let me see.\n\nIn example 1, third row has 9 in column 3. The left value is 4, which is non-zero. So 9 is larger than 4, so output is 4? But the output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value from the previous column.\n\nIn the third row, column 3 is 9. The left value is 6, which is larger, so 9 remains 9. But output is 0.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output value is the minimum of itself and the value from the previous row in the same column.\n\nWait, in that case, the second row's second column is 7. The previous row's second column is 0, so 0 is the output. That matches.\n\nThird row's second column is 9. The previous row's second column is 7, so 7 is the output. That matches.\n\nFourth row's second column is 4. The previous row's second column is 9, so 4 is the output. But in the output, it's 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo that's not the rule.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the minimum of the input value and the value from the left in the same row.\n\nThird row's third column is 9. Left value is 4, so 4 is the output. But in the output, it's 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is zero if the input row is all zeros, and non-zero otherwise, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output value is zero if the input grid has a non-zero in that particular column in any row above. Let me test this.\n\nIn example 1, the second row has 7 in column 2. Any row above it (first row) has 0, so the second row's column 2 is zero. That matches.\n\nThird row has 9 in column 3. Any row above it (second) has 7, so third row's column 3 is zero. That matches.\n\nFourth row has 4 in column 4. Any row above it (third) has 9, so column 4 remains zero. But in the output, column 4 is 0. That matches.\n\nWait, but in the third row, column 3 is 9, and the output is zero because the row above it is non-zero. That seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, in the fourth row, column 4 is 0 because the row above is non-zero.\n\nLooking at the fifth row, which has 8 in column 5. The row above it (fourth) has 4 in column 4. Since column 4 in the fifth row is 0, because the fourth row's column 4 is 0, but in the fourth row, the input was 4 in column 4. Wait, no, the fourth row's input is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 4 is 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nThe rule seems to be: For each cell (i, j), the output value is zero if the input grid has a non-zero value in any cell (k, j) for k < i. Otherwise, it's the minimum of the input value and the value from the left in the same row.\n\nWait, that's a bit complex. Let me test this with example 1.\n\nTake the third row, which has 9 in column 3. The row above it (second) has 7. Since column 3 in the second row is 7, which is non-zero, does that mean the third row's column 3 becomes zero? No, because the third row's output is 0. Wait, that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that if any row above has a non-zero in column j, then the output is zero. Otherwise, it's the minimum of the input value and the value from the left in the same row.\n\nLet me test this.\n\nFor example, the second row in input has 7 in column 2. Since the row above (first) has 0, so the second row's column 2 is zero. That matches the output.\n\nThird row has 9 in column 3. The row above (second) has 7. Since any row above has a non-zero in column 3, the output is zero. That matches.\n\nFourth row has 4 in column 4. The row above (third) has 9, so any row above has a non-zero in column 4. So the output is zero, but in the output, it's 0. Wait, no, in example 1, the fourth row's output is 0. So that fits.\n\nWait, but the fourth row's column 4 is 0. So yes, it's zero because the row above (third) has a non-zero in column 4.\n\nSimilarly, the fifth row has 8 in column 5. The row above (fourth) has a non-zero in column 4 (4), so the output is zero. That matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, the sixth row's column 8 is 8. The row above (fifth) has a non-zero in column 5 (8), so the output is zero. That matches.\n\nLooking at the seventh row, which has 8 in column 8. The row above (sixth) has a non-zero in column 7 (8), so the output is zero. That matches.\n\nThe eighth row has 0s, so it's zero. The ninth row has 8 in column 8. The row above (eighth) has a non-zero in column 7 (8), so output is zero. That matches.\n\nThe tenth row has 0s, so it's zero. The eleventh row has 0s, so zero. The twelfth row has 0s, zero. The thirteenth row has 0s, zero. The fourteenth row has 0s, zero.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), if there exists any row above i that has a non-zero in column j, then the output cell is zero. Otherwise, the output cell is the minimum of the input cell at (i, j) and the input cell at (i-1, j-1) (if j-1 exists, otherwise 0).\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, the output is zero if any of the cells above (including the same row and to the left) in column j are non-zero. Otherwise, it's the minimum of the current cell and the cell to the left in the same row.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output is zero if the input has a non-zero in any cell (k, j) for any k < i. If not, then it's the minimum of the current cell and the cell to the left in the same row.\n\nLet me test this.\n\nTake the second row in example 1: [7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The row above is [0, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Since the first cell in the second row is 7, which is non-zero, the rule says the output should be zero. That matches.\n\nThird row: [0, 9, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The row above is non-zero, so output is zero. That matches.\n\nFourth row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The row above is non-zero, so output is zero. That matches.\n\nFifth row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]. The row above is non-zero, so output is zero. That matches.\n\nSixth row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]. The row above is non-zero, so output is zero. That matches.\n\nSeventh row: [3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]. The row above has a non-zero in column 5 (8). So output is zero. That matches.\n\nEighth row: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]. The row above is non-zero in column 5, so output is zero. That matches.\n\nNinth row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output is zero, matches.\n\nTenth row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output is zero, matches.\n\nEleventh row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output is zero, matches.\n\nTwelfth row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output is zero, matches.\n\nThirteenth row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output is zero, matches.\n\nSo this rule seems to fit.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in this case, most rows are zero except the second row, which has 8 in column 2 and 8 in column 3, and 8 in column 8 and 8 in", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 4\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me take a closer look at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a few non-zero numbers. The output seems to preserve the zero entries but changes the non-zero values in a specific way. For instance, the first row in the input has a lot of zeros, and the corresponding output row is all zeros. The second row in the input has 7, 6, and 0s, but in the output, it's 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check again.\n\nOh, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at the input and output more carefully. The second row of the input is [0, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output for that row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Hmm, that's interesting. So the non-zero values in the input are being set to zero in the output? But then in the third row of the input, which is [0, 9, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Wait, so it's not just setting them to zero, but maybe some other transformation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the positions of the non-zero numbers. Let me look at the first non-zero row. In the input, the second row has a 7 and a 6 in the second and third columns. In the output, those columns are zero, but the others are also zero. That doesn't seem to align.\n\nMaybe I should look at another part of the grid. Let's take the last row of the input, which is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output is the same. So zeros remain zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a zero remains zero, but non-zero cells are set to zero in the output. But that would make the output grid all zeros, which is not the case. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's that certain cells are set to zero, but others are not. Let me check specific cells. For example, in the second row of the input, the first element is zero, and in the output, it's also zero. The second element is 7, and in the output, it's zero. The third element is 6, and in the output, it's zero. The rest are zeros. So it seems like the non-zero elements are being set to zero, but only in specific columns.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the positions of the non-zero numbers. Let me see: in the second row, the non-zero numbers are in columns 2 and 3. In the output, these columns are zero, but the other columns remain zero. But how does that affect other rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any cell that is reachable from a non-zero cell in the input is set to the minimum of the two cells. Wait, that might be a possibility. Let me test that idea.\n\nFor example, in the second row of the input, the second element is 7 and the third is 6. If I take the minimum of those, it's 6, but in the output, both are zero. That doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the parity of the cell's value. For instance, if a cell is even, it's set to zero; if it's odd, it's set to itself. Let me check.\n\nIn the second row, the second element is 7 (odd), so it would be set to zero. The third element is 6 (even), so it would be set to zero. That fits. In the third row, the first element is 9 (odd), so it would be zero. The fourth element is 4 (even), so it would be zero. That also fits.\n\nLooking at another row, say the sixth row of the input, which is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output is the same. So zeros remain zero.\n\nAnother row in the input is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which remains the same. So the rule seems to be: if a cell's value is non-zero, it is set to zero; if it's zero, it remains zero.\n\nWait, but that would make the entire grid zero, which is not the case. So perhaps there's more to it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that non-zero cells are turned into zero, but the positions where the non-zero cells were are set to the minimum of the non-zero cells in those positions. Let me think.\n\nFor example, in the second row, the second element is 7 and the third is 6. The minimum is 6, but in the output, both are zero. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the positions of the non-zero cells. Let me think about how the non-zero cells are distributed across the rows.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the non-zero cells are mostly in the second and third rows, and some in the sixth and seventh rows. The output seems to have zeros in those positions as well, but perhaps in different columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the positions of the non-zero cells being moved to certain columns. For example, in the second row, the non-zero cells are in columns 2 and 3. In the output, those columns remain zero, but the others are zero as well. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the cells being set to zero if they are in the same column as any non-zero cell in the input. Let me check.\n\nIn the second row, the non-zero cells are in columns 2 and 3. In the output, both columns are zero. So that fits. In the third row, the non-zero cells are in columns 2 and 3 as well. So those columns are zero in the output. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but in the sixth row, the non-zero cells are in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the output, the second, third, and fourth columns are zero. So that doesn't fit. Because the non-zero cells are not all in the same columns as the output's zero columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is reachable from a non-zero cell is set to zero. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the cells being set to zero if they are in the same row or column as a non-zero cell. Let me test that.\n\nIn the second row, the non-zero cells are in columns 2 and 3. So in the output, all cells are zero, which includes columns 2 and 3. That fits. In the third row, same thing. In the sixth row, non-zero cells are in columns 1, 2, 3, 4. The output has zeros in columns 2, 3, 4. So that doesn't fit because column 1 is non-zero and remains non-zero.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not the rule.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any cell that is a non-zero in the input is turned into zero, but the positions where the non-zero cells were are set to the minimum of the non-zero cells in those positions. Let me try that.\n\nFor example, in the second row, the second element is 7 and the third is 6. The minimum is 6, so both would be set to 6. But in the output, they are both zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the cells being set to zero if they are in the same row or column as any non-zero cell, but that doesn't align with the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that non-zero cells are turned into zero, but the positions where the non-zero cells were are set to zero. That would mean the output is all zeros, which is not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output based on the input.\n\nLet me look at the first row of the input and output. The input has a lot of zeros, and the output is the same. So zeros remain zero.\n\nIn the second row of the input, the non-zero cells are 7 and 6. In the output, these are zero. So perhaps non-zero cells are being turned into zero.\n\nBut then in the third row, the non-zero cells are 9 and 4, which are turned into zero. Similarly, in the sixth row, non-zero cells are turned into zero.\n\nWait, but in the last row of the input, all cells are zero, so the output is the same.\n\nWait, but in the second row, the non-zero cells are in columns 2 and 3. In the output, these columns are zero, but the other columns remain zero as well. So perhaps any non-zero cell in the input is turned into zero in the output.\n\nBut that would make the entire grid zero, which is not the case. So perhaps it's not just setting non-zero cells to zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is reachable from a non-zero cell in the input is set to zero. For example, in the second row, the non-zero cells are in columns 2 and 3. In the output, these columns are zero, but the other columns are also zero, which doesn't fit because the other cells in the input are zero.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the position of non-zero cells. Let me think about the non-zero cells in each row and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the non-zero cells are mostly in the second and third rows, some in the sixth and seventh rows. The output seems to have zeros in those positions as well, but perhaps in different columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that non-zero cells are turned into zero, but their positions are shifted based on some rule. For example, in the second row, the non-zero cells are in columns 2 and 3, and in the output, they are shifted to columns 4 and 5? But that doesn't align with the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that non-zero cells are turned into zero, but their values are set to the minimum of the non-zero cells in their row or column.\n\nWait, but in the second row, the non-zero cells are 7 and 6. The minimum is 6, so both would be set to 6, but in the output, they are zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that non-zero cells are turned into zero, but the values are set to the same as the minimum of the non-zero cells in their row or column.\n\nWait, but again, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is non-zero in the input is turned into zero, but only if it's in a certain set of columns. Looking at the output, perhaps certain columns are set to zero regardless of the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is non-zero in the input is turned into zero, but the positions where the non-zero cells were are set to zero. That would mean the output is all zeros, which is not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that non-zero cells are turned into zero, but the positions where the non-zero cells were are set to zero, and any other cells remain as they are. But in the second row of the input, the non-zero cells are 7 and 6, and in the output, both are zero. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in the third row, the non-zero cells are 9 and 4, and in the output, both are zero. So that fits as well.\n\nIn the sixth row, the non-zero cells are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the output is the same, which fits.\n\nWait, but what about the seventh row? It's [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], so the output is the same.\n\nWait, but in the second row, the input has 7 in column 2 and 6 in column 3. The output has both set to zero. Similarly, in the third row, 9 in column 2 and 4 in column 3 are set to zero. So perhaps the rule is that any cell that is non-zero in the input is turned into zero, regardless of its position.\n\nBut then why are the non-zero values in the input being turned into zero in the output? It seems like a straightforward transformation.\n\nWait, but in the last row of Example 1, the input is all zeros, and the output is all zeros as well. So that fits.\n\nWait, but let me check another example to see if this rule holds. Looking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, in the second row of the input, the non-zero cells are 8 in column 2 and 8 in column 3. In the output, both are 7 and 7. But according to the rule I thought of (turning non-zero cells into zero), this wouldn't happen. So perhaps my initial thought is incorrect.\n\nWait, so in the output, the non-zero cells are not zero, but maybe they are set to the minimum value in their row or column. Let me check.\n\nIn the second row, the non-zero cells are 8 and 8. The minimum is 8, so they remain 8. But in the output, they are 7 and 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are set to the minimum of the non-zero cells in that row or column. Wait, but in this case, the minimum is 8, so they remain 8. But the output shows 7s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is non-zero in the input is set to the minimum of the non-zero cells in its row or column. Let me test that.\n\nIn the second row, the non-zero cells are 8 and 8. The minimum is 8, so both would be set to 8. But in the output, they are 7 and 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is non-zero in the input is set to zero, but the values are carried over. But that doesn't explain the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is non-zero in the input is set to zero, but the values are carried over if they are in the same column as another non-zero cell. Or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the output, the non-zero cells are turned into zero, but their positions are shifted to certain columns based on the positions of the non-zero cells in the input.\n\nWait, let me look at Example 1 again. The second row of the output has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. But the input has non-zero cells in columns 2 and 3. So why are they all zeros in the output?\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that non-zero cells are turned into zero, but only if they are in the same column as any other non-zero cell in the input. Let me test that.\n\nIn the second row, the non-zero cells are in columns 2 and 3. If there are any other non-zero cells in those columns, then their cells are also set to zero. But in the input, those columns are zero, so their cells remain zero.\n\nWait, but in the third row, the non-zero cells are in columns 2 and 3 as well. So their cells would be set to zero in the output. Similarly, in the sixth row, non-zero cells are in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4. Wait, in the input, columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 have non-zero cells. If the rule is that any cell in the same column as a non-zero cell is set to zero, then in the output, those columns would be zero, but in the output, columns 2 and 3 are zero, but columns 1 and 4 are also zero. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in the sixth row of Example 1, the input has non-zero cells in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4. So according to the rule, columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 should be zero in the output. But in the output, those columns are zero, so that fits.

Let me start by carefully examining both examples to see if I can spot any patterns or similarities.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a mix of zeros and numbers, mostly 0s and a few larger numbers like 7, 6, 9, etc. The output grid is mostly zeros, but there are some non-zero values that seem to follow a specific pattern. Let's compare the input and output grids row by row.\n\nFirst, I notice that in the input grid, the numbers increase toward the center, while in the output grid, a lot of zeros are replaced with other numbers, but their positions are different. For example, in the first few rows of the input, there are 7s and 6s, which appear in the output grid. In the second example, the input has numbers like 8, 7, 6, which are also present in the output, but their placements are different too.\n\nI think the key here might be how the numbers are placed. In Example 1, the 7 and 6 in the second row are in specific columns, and in the output, they remain in the same columns but are in different rows. Similarly, in Example 2, the numbers like 7 and 6 are in specific positions. This suggests that the rule involves identifying certain columns or rows based on the values and then rearranging them.\n\nAnother observation is that the rule might involve some kind of transformation, like rotating the grid or moving elements, but given the output patterns, it's more about retaining positions of certain values. For instance, in the second example, the 7 and 6 are in different columns, but their presence is mirrored in the output.\n\nI also notice that the positions of non-zero numbers in both examples are following a specific pattern. In Example 1, the 7 and 6 are in the fourth and fifth columns, while in Example 2, the 7 and 6 are in the second and third columns. This might mean that the rule involves identifying the middle column and then moving certain values there, but it's not exactly moving them.\n\nPerhaps the rule is about identifying the highest value in a row or column and moving it to a certain position. Looking at Example 1, the second row has 7 and 6 in the fourth and fifth columns. If these are the highest values in their respective rows, maybe they get moved to the center or another position.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe it's about the distance from the edge. In Example 1, the 7 and 6 are closer to the top than the zeros are. Maybe they are being moved down towards the center based on their value. But in the output, these values are still in the same columns but different rows. So that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves identifying the largest number in each row and column and then rotating them. For instance, in Example 1, the largest numbers are 9 in the fifth row and 8 in the second and sixth rows. These might be being moved to specific columns, but I'm not sure how this translates into the output.\n\nAnother approach could be to look at the positions of non-zero values. In Example 1, the non-zero values are mostly in the fourth and fifth columns of the first few rows and then in the fourth and fifth rows of the last few. In Example 2, the non-zero values are in the second and third columns of the first few rows and then in the second and third columns of the later rows.\n\nThis suggests that the rule involves identifying certain columns based on the values and then keeping those columns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the non-zero values are in columns 4 and 5, and in Example 2, they are in columns 2 and 3. This might mean that the rule is to keep the columns that contain the highest values and rearrange the rows accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the highest value in each row. For instance, in Example 1, the second row has the highest value (7) in column 4, and the sixth row has 8 in column 5, which is also the highest. So perhaps these are being moved to the center or another position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about identifying the middle row(s) and then moving certain columns to those rows. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has 8s, which might be the center, and the 7 and 6 are in the fourth and fifth columns, which are adjacent to the center.\n\nThis is getting a bit vague. Maybe I should consider how the non-zero values are positioned in the output relative to their positions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 7 and 6 in the second row are in the same columns as in the sixth row (positions 4 and 5). Similarly, in the sixth row, the 9 and 8 are in positions 5 and 6, which correspond to the same columns in the second row.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule involves keeping the values in the same columns but rearranging them into different rows. For example, in Example 1, the 7 and 6 are moved from row 2 to rows 4 and 5, but I'm not sure about the exact pattern.\n\nAnother idea is to look at the positions of the zeros and see if they are being replaced by certain values. In Example 1, the output has 0s in the same positions as some non-zero values, but only in specific rows. For instance, the 0s in row 2 and 3 are filled with 7 and 6, which are the highest values in their respective columns.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the highest value in each column. If each column has a highest value, then those values are kept in their columns but in a certain order. For example, in Example 1, column 4 has the highest value 9, which is in row 6. Column 5 has 8 in row 6 as well. So perhaps the rule is to keep these high values in their columns and rearrange the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves identifying the highest value in each column and then keeping those in their respective columns. For example, in Example 1, the highest values are 9 in column 5 (row 6), 8 in column 5 (row 6), and 7 in column 4 (row 2). These are kept in their columns but in different rows.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to formalize this. The rule seems to involve identifying columns based on the highest values and then keeping those columns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the highest values are in columns 4 and 5, which are kept in the output, but their positions are shifted.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be about rotating the grid such that certain columns are moved to the center or other positions. For example, in Example 1, the 9 and 8 in column 5 might be moved down to the center rows, and the 7 and 6 are adjusted accordingly.\n\nI think I need to look for a more systematic approach. Maybe I can compare the input and output grids row by row and identify which columns are being retained and which are being replaced.\n\nIn Example 1, the output grid has a lot of zeros, while the input has mostly non-zero values. The non-zero values in the output seem to be in specific columns that are common in both input and output grids but not in the middle. For example, in the second row of the output, the non-zero values are in columns 4 and 5, which are similar to the input's second row columns 4 and 5. Similarly, in the fourth row, the non-zero values are in columns 4 and 5 again.\n\nThis suggests that the rule is about retaining certain columns based on their presence in the input and then keeping them in the output. The columns that are retained are those that have non-zero values in the input, but their positions are adjusted according to the rule.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might involve identifying the highest value in each row and moving it to a certain column. For example, in the second row, the highest value is 7, which is moved to column 5, and the 6 is moved to column 4, which are the retained columns.\n\nWait, this seems plausible. So, the rule could be: for each row, find the highest value, and then move it to the corresponding column in the output grid. But looking back, in Example 1, the highest value in the second row is 7, which is moved to column 5, and the 6 is moved to column 4, which are the columns retained in the output.\n\nSimilarly, in the sixth row of the input, the highest value is 8, which is moved to column 6, and the 9 is moved to column 5, which are the retained columns.\n\nThis seems to fit the output grid. Let me test this theory with another example.\n\nIn Example 2, let's look at the input grid. The second row has 8, 8, 8, 0, etc., and the third row has 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0. The highest values in each row would be in the second row as 8 and 8, and in the third row as 8 and 8. These would be moved to their respective columns in the output.\n\nLooking at the output grid of Example 2, the second row has 7 and 7, which are the highest values from the second row of the input, moved to columns 2 and 3. Similarly, the third row has 6 and 6, which are the highest values from the third row of the input, moved to columns 2 and 3.\n\nThis supports the idea that the rule is to find the highest value in each row and move it to the corresponding column in the output grid. However, I need to ensure this rule is consistent across all examples.\n\nLet me consider another example where the grid might have a different pattern. Suppose a row has a mix of zeros and higher values, like 5, 3, 7, 2. The highest value is 7 in column 3. According to the rule, this 7 would be moved to column 3 in the output grid. Similarly, in the output grid, this 7 would appear in column 3, and any other non-zero values would be moved accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the output grid, the 7 would be in column 3, which was the original column with the highest value in that row. So, the rule seems to be: in each row, find the highest value, and in the output grid, place this highest value in the same column as the highest value in that row, but shifted to the appropriate position.\n\nThis makes sense because in the output grid, the non-zero values are shifted to the columns that originally contained the highest values of each row. This way, the highest values are retained in their respective columns but adjusted to their new positions.\n\nTo summarize, the rule is: for each row, identify the highest value and its column, then in the output grid, place this highest value in the same column but in a position that corresponds to the row in the input grid. This means that the non-zero values in the output are shifted to columns that originally had the highest values in each row, while their rows are adjusted based on the input grid.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid provided, I can predict the corresponding output grid by identifying the columns that originally had the highest values in each row and then placing the non-zero values accordingly.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 4\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, looking at the examples provided, I need to find a common pattern or operation that applies to both the input and output grids.\n\nFirst, I notice that in both examples, some rows are being transformed into zeros, while others remain unchanged. For instance, in Example 1, the output grid has a lot of zeros where the input has non-zero values. However, some specific patterns in the input seem to influence the output, like the positions of 7s, 8s, 9s, and zeros.\n\nI think the rule might involve some form of transformation on the rows. Let me look at the first example again. The input has zeros except for a few positions where it contains 7s, 8s, and 9s. The output grid also has a lot of zeros, but in the rows where the input had non-zero values, the output had specific non-zero values too.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s and 9s in certain positions, and the output shows similar numbers in specific rows. It seems like the rule is more about the values in the input grid determining certain rows in the output grid.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each row, if the corresponding position in the input grid is non-zero, then that row in the output grid is also non-zero. But the exact values depend on the input values.\n\nLooking closer, I see that in Example 1, the output grid has non-zero values where the input had 7s, 8s, or 9s. So maybe the rule is that if the input has a non-zero number in a certain position, then the output grid's corresponding position is that number. But I need to confirm this with more examples or specific rows.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a bitwise operation, like OR or AND. Let me check. If I consider each row, maybe the output row is derived by applying a bitwise OR or AND with the input row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cumulative sum or product of the input values. But considering the examples, that might complicate things, and the output seems to be more specific in terms of certain positions.\n\nAnother idea is that the output grid is constructed based on the maximum or minimum values in the input grid's rows or columns. But looking at the examples, it's not immediately clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each row in the output is a version of the corresponding row in the input, but with certain positions set based on the input's non-zero values. For example, if a position in the input is 7, then the output might have a corresponding position that's 7. But I need to see how it applies consistently across the grid.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has a 9 in the second row, third column, and the output has a 9 in the fourth row, fifth column. Similarly, the 7 in the first row, second column appears in the output as 0 in the first row, but in another position. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row where the input has a non-zero value, but the output row is zero elsewhere. But in the examples, that's not the case because the output has zeros in other positions too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but only in certain positions. For example, if the input row has a 7 in a certain column, the output row might have a 7 in another column.\n\nBut looking at the second example, the input has 8s and 9s in specific rows and columns, and the output reflects that in specific positions. So perhaps the rule is that the output row is a permutation of the input row's non-zero values, but in the order of their appearance.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output rows with 8s and 9s seem to have the 8s and 9s in a different order compared to the input. For example, the input has 8 in the second row, third column, and the output has 8 in the fourth row, fifth column, and 9 in the sixth row, seventh column. So maybe the order of the non-zero values in the output row is different from the input.\n\nThis suggests that the rule involves both the values and their positions. Perhaps the output row is constructed by taking the non-zero values from the input row, sorted in descending order, and placed in the output row in the order of their original positions.\n\nBut I need to verify this with more examples. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a rotation or shift of the input row's non-zero values. For example, in the first example, the output row where the input had 7s and 8s is shifted or permuted in some way.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1, the output row where the input had 7s and 8s is the fourth row, which has 0s except for 7 and 6. It seems like the 7 is in the fifth position and the 6 is in the sixth position. This doesn't fit a simple shift or permutation pattern.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider that each output row is derived by taking the maximum value from each column across the input rows, but that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves the sum of the input grid's rows or columns. Let me see: the sum of the first row in Example 1 is zero, and in the output, the first row is all zeros. Similarly, the sum of the second row in the input is 0 + 7 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 13, but in the output, the second row is all zeros, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe not summing. Let me think about the number of non-zero elements. The input has 17 non-zero elements, and the output has more zeros, so that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a version of the input row where certain positions are filled with specific values based on the input's non-zero values. For example, if a position in the input has a 7, then the output has a 7 in another position.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has a 9 in the second row, third column. In the output, the fourth row, fifth column has a 9. Similarly, the input has a 7 in the first row, second column, and the output has a 7 in the first row, sixth column. So it seems that the positions are being permuted, but not in a straightforward way.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but placed in the output row in the order of their positions. For example, if the input row has non-zero values in columns 1, 3, and 5, then the output row would have those values in the same order, but filled in the output row's respective columns.\n\nIn Example 1, let's look at the first row: all zeros. In the second row, there's a 7 in column 2 and a 6 in column 3. In the output, the second row has a 7 and a 6, but they are placed in different columns. For example, the 7 was in column 2, but in the output, it's in column 6. Similarly, the 6 was in column 3, but in the output, it's in column 5.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit a simple permutation. Maybe the rule is that the output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but the values are taken in reverse order. For example, the input row in Example 1 has 7 in column 2 and 6 in column 3, but in the output, the 7 is in column 6 and the 6 is in column 5. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but the values are taken in the order of their appearance in the input row. So, the 7 in column 2 and the 6 in column 3 remain in those columns in the output. But in the output, the second row has a 7 in column 6, which was previously zero, and a 6 in column 5, which was also zero. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero values in the input are kept, but zeros are kept as zeros in the output.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the output rows have zeros where the input had zeros, but also some non-zero values where the input had non-zero values. So maybe the rule is that the output row has non-zero values only where the input had non-zero values, but the specific values depend on the input.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has non-zero values in certain positions, and the output has non-zero values in specific positions. For example, the output row where the input had 7s and 8s has 7 in the fifth column and 6 in the sixth column. This suggests that the rule is more about the positions of the non-zero values rather than their values.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the input row's non-zero values, but maintaining their order. For example, if the input row has non-zero values in columns 1, 3, and 5, then the output row would have those values in the same order. But in Example 1, the input row has non-zero values in columns 1, 2, 3, and 5 (assuming all are non-zero, but in the first example, the input row is all zeros). Wait, no, in the first example input row is all zeros, so the output row is all zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the second example. Let me look at it again. The input has a 9 in the second row, third column, and the output has a 9 in the fourth row, fifth column. Similarly, the output row with 8s and 9s has 8s in specific columns. This suggests that the rule is about the positions of the non-zero values in the output row being the same as the input row, but their values are specific.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but the specific values depend on the input's non-zero values in the same columns. For example, if a column in the input has a non-zero value, then the output row has the same value in that column, but only if the input had a non-zero value in that column.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output row where the input had a non-zero value has those values in the same columns. For example, the input had a 9 in column 3 of the third row, and the output has a 9 in column 5 of the fourth row. Similarly, the input had a 7 in column 2 of the first row, and the output has a 7 in column 6 of the second row.\n\nThis seems inconsistent because the 9 in column 3 is in a different position in the output row. So maybe the rule is that the output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but the specific values are set based on the input's non-zero values in the same columns.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a matter of taking the non-zero values from the input row and placing them in specific positions in the output row. For example, if the input row has non-zero values in columns 1, 3, and 5, then the output row would have those values in the same columns, but scaled or transformed.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to think of this as a matrix transformation where each output row is a permutation or rearrangement of the input row's non-zero values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output row is formed by taking the non-zero values from the input row and placing them in the same columns but with specific values, perhaps based on some calculation.\n\nWait, let's look at the first example again. The input row with 7s and 8s in columns 2 and 3 is transformed into a row with 7 in column 6 and 6 in column 5. So the 7 was in column 2, but now it's in column 6. Similarly, the 8 was in column 3, but it's now in column 5. This suggests that the columns are being reordered, but not simply shifted or permuted in a straightforward way.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but the specific values are determined by the input's non-zero values in the same columns. For example, if a column has a non-zero value in the input, then the same column in the output row will have the same value.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output row with 7s and 8s has 7 in column 6 and 6 in column 5, which are non-zero columns in the input, so that makes sense. Similarly, the input had a 9 in column 3, and the output had a 9 in column 5, which is also a non-zero column in the input, so that fits.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output rows have 8s and 9s in certain columns, and the input rows have non-zero values in different columns. For example, the input row with 8 in column 2 was transformed into a row with 8 in column 4. Similarly, the input row with 9 in column 4 was transformed into a row with 9 in column 6.\n\nThis seems like a consistent pattern: the output row has non-zero values in columns that are a certain distance or pattern away from the input rows' non-zero columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values in the same columns. For example, if the input row has a non-zero value in column 1, then the output row will have the same value in column 1, but perhaps also in other columns where the input had non-zero values.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output row with 7s and 8s has 7 in column 6 and 6 in column 5, which are non-zero in the input. So that fits. Similarly, the input row with a 9 in column 3 is transformed into a row with a 9 in column 5, which is also non-zero in the input.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but only in the same columns. The values can be scaled or transformed, but the positions are preserved.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input has a 7 in column 2, but the output has a 7 in column 6. So maybe the value is retained, but the position is changed based on some rule. For example, it could be that the position is shifted or transformed in some way, like adding a certain number or multiplying.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input row with 7 in column 2 is transformed into a row with 7 in column 6. Similarly, the 8 in column 3 is transformed into a row with 8 in column 5. This seems like the position is being moved by a certain distance. For example, from column 2 to column 6 is a shift of 4 positions to the right, and from column 3 to column 5 is a shift of 2 positions to the right.\n\nWait, but this seems inconsistent because the shift varies for each value. Alternatively, maybe it's a rotation or cyclic shift. For example, in a 10-column grid, shifting by 8 positions to the right would move a column from position 2 to position 10, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but in a different order, perhaps based on the input's non-zero values in the same columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but the specific values are determined by the input's non-zero values in the same columns. For example, if the input row has non-zero values in columns 1, 3, and 5, then the output row will have the same values in those columns, but scaled or transformed in some way.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output row has 7 in column 6 and 6 in column 5, which are non-zero columns in the input. So that fits. Similarly, the input had a 9 in column 3, and the output had a 9 in column 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but the specific values are determined by the input's non-zero values in the same columns, with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but the specific values are determined by the input's non-zero values in the same columns, with the values being multiplied by a certain factor.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input had a 7 in column 2, and the output had a 7 in column 6, which is the same value. Similarly, the 8 in column 3 was transformed into a 8 in column 5, preserving the value but shifting the column.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a copy of the input row's non-zero values, but the specific values are determined by the input's non-zero values in the same columns, with the values being the same as in the input row.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output row has 7s and 8s in columns 6 and 5, which are non-zero columns in the input. So that suggests that the values are retained, but the columns are changed.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output row is formed by taking the non-zero values from the input row and placing them in the same columns, but the specific values are determined by some function of the input's non-zero values in the same columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a matter of taking the non-zero values from the input row and scaling them or transforming them into the output row's columns.\n\nWait, another approach could be to consider that each output row is the same as the input row's non-zero values, but in a different order, determined by the positions of the non-zero values in the input row.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input row with a 7 in column 2 and a 8 in column 3 would have its non-zero values in columns 2 and 3. In the output row, these values are placed in columns 6 and 5, respectively. This suggests that the columns are being reordered, perhaps by shifting or some permutation.\n\nWait, but how does shifting work here?

For instance, the input has a 7 in the second row, sixth column, and an 8 in the fifth row, eighth column. The output mirrors that, showing 7 and 8 as well. \n\nI notice that in the output, certain values are repeated or filled in a specific pattern. It seems like when a value is present in the input, it's either kept the same or possibly transformed based on its surroundings. \n\nAnother observation is that some areas in the input remain zero, and in the output, those zeros are also present. This suggests that the rule might involve some kind of intensity or presence that's preserved. \n\nI also see that the input values are mostly zeros, but there are some non-zero values. The output grid has zeros where the input has them, but also some non-zero values where the input had higher values. \n\nPerhaps the rule is that any non-zero value in the input grid is either kept as is or transformed into a specific value, which is then distributed across the output grid in a particular pattern. \n\nWait, looking closer, in the output, the same non-zero values appear in different parts of the grid. For example, the 7 and 8 from the input become 7 and 6 in the output, but then later become 9 and 4. This makes me think that the transformation isn't fixed but depends on the position or other factors.\n\nI'm starting to think that the rule might involve the number of surrounding non-zero values. For each cell, if it has a certain number of non-zero neighbors, it might be transformed into a specific value. Alternatively, it could be related to the maximum value in the surrounding area or some kind of averaging.\n\nAnother angle is to look at the symmetry in the output. The output grid seems to have some patterns where non-zero values are arranged in specific rows or columns, which might be a result of how the non-zero values propagate through the grid.\n\nI'm also noticing that some rows in the input become entirely zero in the output, while others retain some non-zero values. This might indicate that certain rows have a dominant value, and those are either preserved or transformed into zeros.\n\nOverall, I think the rule involves analyzing the non-zero values in the surrounding cells of each cell in the input grid, determining a transformation rule based on their count or some other property, and then applying that rule consistently across the entire grid to produce the output.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I can examine a specific example. Let's take the first example where the input has a 7 in row 1, column 6. In the output, this value remains 7 but is placed in a different position. This suggests that the value isn't just carried over but transformed according to some rule.\n\nPerhaps the rule involves calculating the sum or the maximum of certain values in the surrounding area. For instance, if the maximum value in a 3x3 area around a cell is greater than a certain threshold, it gets transformed into that value. Alternatively, it could be based on the number of non-zero values in the area.\n\nLooking at the second example, the input has zeros and some non-zero values. The output also reflects this, but with some non-zero values changed. The rule here seems to involve more complex transformations, possibly based on the interactions of multiple non-zero values in the surrounding area.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing the patterns and trying different possibilities, I believe the rule involves examining the non-zero values in the surrounding cells of each cell in the input grid and applying a transformation based on their count, sum, or some other property. This transformation is then applied consistently across the entire grid to produce the output.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 4\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, looking at the examples, I need to find a pattern or transformation that's consistent across all the given inputs and outputs.\n\nStarting with Example 1: The input grid has a lot of zeros and a few non-zero numbers. The output grid seems to have a lot of zeros, but there are some changes. Specifically, the non-zero numbers in the output grid are appearing in specific positions that aren't present in the input. For instance, in the second row of the input, there's a 7 followed by a 6, and in the output, this becomes 0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0. Hmm, that's interesting. So it looks like the non-zero numbers are being moved to specific columns or rows.\n\nLooking at another part of Example 1, the input has a 9 in the third row, and the output has 0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0. Wait, the 9 is now in position 9, but in the output, it's in position 7. That doesn't seem to fit. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the movement. Perhaps the non-zero numbers are being carried over to new positions without changing their values. But that doesn't explain the initial shift.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is about the sum of adjacent cells. For example, in the input, certain cells add up to specific values, and the output reflects that sum. But in Example 1, the sums seem to be getting reduced or changing in a way that's not straightforward.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the positions of the non-zero numbers are being shifted based on some rule. For example, the cell with 7 in the input's second row moves to the sixth position in the output, and the 6 moves to the fifth. Similarly, the 9 in the third row moves to the third row of the output. This suggests that non-zero values are being moved to different columns, possibly based on their original positions.\n\nLooking at Example 2, which is similar to Example 1 but with different values. The output grid has non-zero values appearing in different rows and columns, again following a pattern. It seems like the rule is that non-zero values are moved to specific positions based on their sum or some transformation of their original positions.\n\nPutting this together, the rule might involve calculating a sum for each cell and then placing non-zero values based on some threshold or transformation of that sum. Alternatively, the rule could involve moving non-zero values to specific columns or rows based on their value or position.\n\nTo confirm, let's take another example. In Example 1, the input has a 7 in the second row. The output has a 7 in the sixth position. If we assume that the sum of a row or column determines where the non-zero values go, perhaps each cell's value is summed, and if it's above a certain threshold, it's copied to a new position.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that non-zero values are moved to the right by a certain number of positions, but in Example 1, that doesn't quite match because the 7 moves from column 2 to column 6, which is more than one position to the right.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule involves the sum of adjacent cells. For example, the value in a cell is the sum of its left and right neighbors. But in Example 1, the third row has a 9, and the fourth row has an 8, which doesn't align with a simple sum of adjacent cells.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the non-zero values are being copied to new positions based on the sum of their row and column indices. For example, if the sum of a cell's row and column is above a certain threshold, the value is copied to that new position. This would explain how the non-zero values are moved to different locations.\n\nIn Example 1, let's look at the cell with 7 in the second row. If its row index is 1 (assuming 0-based) and column index is 2, the sum is 3. If the threshold is 3, this cell might be copied to a new position based on this sum. Similarly, the 6 in the second row has a sum of 3, so it's also copied somewhere else.\n\nThis seems plausible. So the rule is that for each cell, if the sum of its row and column indices (1-based) is greater than a certain threshold, the value is copied to a new position determined by that sum. The threshold would be consistent across all cells, and the new position would be calculated based on the sum.\n\nTo test this, let's consider Example 2. The input has a 7 in the second row and a 6 in the third row. The output shows these values being moved to specific positions, and the sums of their new positions should correspond to their original values.\n\nTherefore, the rule is likely that non-zero values are copied from their original positions to new positions based on the sum of their row and column indices (1-based). The new position is determined by this sum, and if the value is above a certain threshold, it's copied to that position.\n\nIn Example 1, after applying this rule, the non-zero values are being moved to positions where the sum of their row and column indices is greater than a threshold, which likely corresponds to the non-zero values being copied to new rows or columns based on this sum.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 4\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has some zeros and a few non-zero numbers, mostly 7, 6, 9, and 8. The output grid shows that these non-zero numbers are preserved in specific positions while the zeros remain as zeros. For instance, the 7 in the second row of the input grid remains in the same position in the output grid, but other non-zero values are shifted or moved.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is more complex with varying numbers and some zeros. The output grid also has a similar pattern where certain non-zero values are in specific positions, and others are zeros. It seems that the rule involves identifying positions where non-zero values are located and keeping those, while zeros are transformed to zeros.\n\nI notice that in both examples, non-zero values in the input are either staying in the same positions or moving to different positions, but the exact movement isn't clear. However, the key observation is that the presence or absence of a non-zero value in a grid cell is preserved in the output grid. That is, if a cell had a non-zero value in the input, it either remains the same or is transformed in a way that doesn't change the presence of that value but alters its position.\n\nAnother point is that the output grid only has zeros in the positions where the input had zeros, except in certain cases where non-zero values were preserved. This suggests that the rule doesn't involve moving values, but rather identifying which cells should retain their values based on some condition.\n\nLet me consider the positions of the non-zero values in the input and output grids to deduce the rule. For example, in Example 1, the cell with 7 in the second row stays in the same position, while the 8s move around in a pattern. Similarly, in Example 2, the 8s and 7s are in specific positions that don't change.\n\nPerhaps the rule involves checking each cell to see if it's a non-zero value and then ensuring that the corresponding cell in the output grid also contains the same non-zero value. This would mean that zeros are preserved, and non-zeros are either kept as they are or moved to their correct positions based on some criteria.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule involves the sum or product of a cell's value and its neighbors. For instance, if a cell's value is non-zero and the sum of it and its neighbors is greater than a certain threshold, it might be preserved. However, this is speculative, and without more data points, it's hard to confirm.\n\nGiven the complexity and variability in the input grids, it's likely that the rule is quite specific and not a straightforward transformation. Instead, it's more about identifying which cells should retain their values based on some condition related to their position or value.\n\nIn conclusion, the rule likely involves checking each cell in the input grid. If a cell contains a non-zero value, the corresponding cell in the output grid should also contain the same non-zero value, while zeros remain zeros. This would explain how the non-zero values are preserved in specific positions as shown in the examples.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 4 0 0 0 0 7 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 4\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Then, in the second row, the input has 7 and 6, and the output has 7 and 6 in the same positions. Similarly, the third row of the output mirrors the second row of the input. This suggests that the output is a transformation where certain values are retained while others are replaced with zeros.\n\nLooking deeper, perhaps the rule involves replacing non-zero values with zeros based on some condition. For example, in Example 1, the input has 7 and 6, which become 7 and 6 in the output. The 8s become 0s in some rows, but that might be part of a different condition.\n\nNow, looking at Example 2:\n\nInput Grid:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 4 3 3 0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput Grid:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAgain, the output has a lot of zeros in the top-left, similar to the input. The second row shows that 8s become 7s, and 4s become 6s. This suggests that non-zero values are being reduced according to some rule. \n\nPutting both examples together, it seems that the rule involves replacing non-zero values with zero in certain positions while keeping some values as is. Specifically, in the examples, non-zero values like 7, 6, 8, 4, 3 are being updated to other values, possibly by replacing them with smaller numbers. \n\nAnother observation is that the rule might involve looking at the sums of certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the row with 8, 8 has outputs 7 and 6, which are the sum of the first two elements. Similarly, in the third row, the two 8s become 9 and 4, which are the sums of the first two elements. \n\nThis leads me to think that the rule could be based on the sum of the first two elements in each row. If the sum is greater than a certain threshold, it might be replaced with zeros or another value. Alternatively, it could be that each row is transformed based on some condition involving the first two elements.\n\nIn Example 2, the second row of the input has 8,8,0,0, etc., and the output has 7,7. If the rule is to replace the sum with another value, perhaps the sum is reduced. For example, 8+8=16 could be reduced to 7 or 6, which are the output values.\n\nSimilarly, the third row of the input has 8,8,8, so the sum is 24, and the output for this row has 6,6,6. That suggests that the rule might involve taking the sum of the first two elements and then reducing it to a certain value, perhaps by division or another operation.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the rule seems to be that for each row, if the sum of the first two elements is greater than zero, it is replaced with a certain value. Looking at the examples, it seems that the value is determined by dividing the sum by a certain number. For instance:\n\n- In the first example, 7 and 6 sum to 13. If 13 is divided by, say, 2, it gives 6.5, but the output is 7 and 6, which are integers. Alternatively, it could be that the sum is reduced to the nearest integer.\n\nWait, in the first example, the input for the second row is 7 and 6 in the output, which are the same as the input. So perhaps the rule is more about keeping certain values and replacing others based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might involve looking at the non-zero elements and their positions. For example, in the second row of the output, the 7 and 6 are non-zero, which might correspond to the non-zero values in the second row of the input. But that doesn't seem consistent across all rows.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the difference between the input and output. In Example 1, the second row of the input has 7 and 6 in the output, which are the same as the input. The third row of the input has 9 and 4, which are also in the output. So perhaps the rule is that non-zero values are retained, and zeros are retained as well, but in the output, certain non-zero values are changed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that zeros are replaced with another value based on some condition. For example, in the third row of the output, the first two zeros are replaced with 0, which doesn't change. The third row of the input had 9 and 4, which were in the output. So maybe the rule is to replace zeros with another value based on the non-zero values in the row.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each row, any zero in the first two positions is replaced with the non-zero value from the first two positions of that row. But in the third row of the output, the first two positions are zeros, but in the input, they are 9 and 4. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that non-zero values are kept, and zeros are kept as zeros, but certain non-zero values are replaced with zeros based on a threshold.\n\nWait, in the first example, the second row has 7 and 6 in the output, which are non-zero, so perhaps those are retained. The third row, which has 9 and 4, is also in the output. So the rule is that for each row, if the first two elements are non-zero, they are kept as is; otherwise, zeros are placed in those positions.\n\nBut looking at the second example, the second row of the input has 8 and 8, which are non-zero in the output. The third row of the input has 4 and 4, which are turned into 6 and 6 in the output. That suggests that the rule is more about reducing the non-zero values based on some calculation.\n\nIn the second example, the second row of the input has 8,8,0,0. The output for that row has 7,7,0,0. So 8+8=16, and perhaps 16 is reduced to 7. Similarly, the third row of the input is 3,4,3,3. The output has 6,6,6,0. Wait, that's 3+4=7, but the output is 6,6,6. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the first two elements that is reduced. For the second row of the input, 8+8=16, which is reduced to 7. The third row of the input, 3+4=7, which is reduced to 6. The fourth row, 8+8=16, reduced to 7 again. The fifth row has 0,0,0,0, so nothing changes. The sixth row has 4,4,0,0, which are reduced to 6,6,6. The seventh row has 3,4,3,3, which are reduced to 6,6,6,0. The eighth row has 0,0,0,0,0. The ninth row has 0,0,0,0. The tenth row has 0,0,0,0.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So the rule is that for each row, if the sum of the first two elements is greater than zero, it is replaced with a certain value. For example, 8+8=16 is replaced with 7, 3+4=7 is replaced with 6, 8+8=16 is replaced with 7, and 4+4=8 is replaced with 6. So perhaps the rule is to replace the sum of the first two elements with the sum divided by 2, rounded down.\n\nLet me check:\n\n- 7 + 6 = 13 \u2192 6 (13//2=6)\n- 8 + 8 = 16 \u2192 8 (16//2=8, but in the output, it's 7, so maybe it's 16//2=8, but perhaps there's another rule)\nWait, in the first example, the second row is 7 and 6, which are turned into 7 and 6. So perhaps the rule is that the sum is kept, but it's then rounded down to the nearest integer. But 7+6=13, which would be 6, but in the output it's 7 and 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the sum is kept, but then in the output, the sum is set to zero if it's above a certain value. Or perhaps the rule is to replace the sum with another value based on some calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, the non-zero values are kept, and zeros are kept as zeros, but the sum of the non-zero values is replaced with another value. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 7 and 6, whose sum is 13. But in the output, 7 and 6 are present. So perhaps the rule is to replace the sum with another value if it's above a certain threshold.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each row, any zero in the first two positions is replaced with the non-zero value from the first two positions of that row. But that doesn't fit the second example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, the first two elements are kept as is, and any zeros in other positions are replaced with the sum of the first two elements. But in the second row, the sum is 13, and the output's third and fourth elements are zeros, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each row, the sum of the first two elements is kept as is, but in the output, the sum is replaced with a specific value. For example, in the second row of the first example, the sum is 13, which is kept as 7 and 6. So perhaps the rule is to replace the sum with another value, such as the sum minus 6, which gives 7. Similarly, in the third row, the sum is 16, which is reduced to 10, but in the output, it's 9 and 4, which don't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, the first two elements are kept if they are non-zero, otherwise zeros are placed. But that doesn't explain the changes in the first and third rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each row, any zero in the first two positions is replaced with the non-zero value from the first two positions of that row. But in the second row of the first example, the first two elements are 7 and 6, so the third and fourth elements are zeros, but in the output, they remain zeros. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, any zero in the first two positions is replaced with the sum of the first two elements divided by two. For example, in the second row, 7+6=13, 13/2=6.5, which is rounded to 6, but in the output, it's 7 and 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each row, the first two elements are kept, and zeros are kept as zeros. Then, any non-zero elements beyond the first two are kept as is, but zeros are kept as zeros. But that doesn't explain the changes in the first and third rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, the first two elements are kept, and zeros are kept as zeros. Then, any non-zero elements in the remaining positions are replaced with zeros. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each row, the first two elements are kept, and any zeros beyond the first two positions are considered as non-zero in the output. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, the first two elements are kept, and zeros are kept as zeros.

Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and some non-zero numbers. After applying the rule, some of those zeros remain, but others change. Let me compare specific rows.\n\nLooking at the first example, I see that in the input, the third row has 0s and a 9 in the fourth position. In the output, the third row is all zeros, except for the fourth position which is 9. Wait, no, the output for the third row is all zeros. Hmm, maybe I need to look at another example.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a row with 8s and 7s. The output has a similar pattern but with different numbers. For instance, the row in the input that starts with 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0 becomes 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So it seems like the numbers are decreasing by 1 each time they appear.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number in the input is reduced by 1 in the output, but only for certain positions. Let me check another part.\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row has a 0 in the input. In the output, it's still 0. So zeros stay the same. For the third row, it's 0s and a 9, which becomes a 9 in the output. Wait, but in Example 2, the third row had a 9 and became a 7. Maybe it's not that straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number in the input is replaced by the number minus 1, but only if it's greater than 1. So 8 becomes 7, 9 becomes 8, and so on. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row has a 9, which becomes 8 in the output. But in the output, it's 0. That doesn't fit. So maybe it's not that simple.\n\nWait, looking back, in Example 2, the input row with 8s becomes 7s, and the row with 9 becomes 8. So it's subtracting 1 each time. Maybe the rule is that any non-zero number greater than 0 is reduced by 1 in the output. But then, in Example 1, a 9 becomes 8, which is in the output. So that might work.\n\nBut let me check other parts. In Example 1, the fourth row is all zeros, so they stay as zeros. The fifth row has an 8, which becomes 7. The sixth row has two 8s, which become 7 and 7. The seventh row is all zeros. The eighth row has 0s and 8, 8. The ninth row has 0 and 8,8. The tenth row has zeros. The eleventh row has 0s and 0,0. The twelfth row has 0s and three 0s. The thirteenth row is all zeros. The fourteenth row has 0s and two 0s. The fifteenth row has 0s.\n\nWait, in the output of Example 1, the fifth row has 0s and a 7, which corresponds to the input row having an 8. The sixth row has two 7s, which corresponds to the input having two 8s. So yes, it seems like any non-zero number greater than 0 in the input is reduced by 1 in the output.\n\nLet me check Example 2 again. The first row is all zeros. The second row has an 8, which becomes 7. The third row has three 8s, which become 7,7,7. The fourth row is all zeros. The fifth row has a 7, which becomes 7. The sixth row has two 7s, which correspond to the two 8s in the input. The seventh row is all zeros. The eighth row has 7,7,0,0,0. The input row has 7,7,0,0,0 and output has 0,0,0,0,0? Wait, no, in Example 2, the input row with 7,7,0,0,0 becomes 0,0,0,0,0? That doesn't fit the rule I thought of.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input row with 8,8,8 becomes 7,7,7 in the output. The input row with 9,4,3 becomes 7,6,3 in the output. Wait, but 9 becomes 7 and 4 becomes 6. So it's not just subtracting 1, but maybe some other transformation.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by the sum of its digits. Let's see: 8 becomes 8, 9 becomes 9, 7 becomes 7, 6 becomes 6, etc. But that doesn't fit the Example 1, because in Example 1, a 9 becomes 8, which matches the sum of digits (9 becomes 9, but in the output it's 8). Wait, no, in Example 1, the first row has 0s and 0s, so they stay the same. The third row has a 9, which becomes 8 in the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by the largest digit in that position. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row has a 9, which is the largest digit. In the output, it's 8. That doesn't fit. Wait, no, in the output, the third row has 0s and 8, which is the largest digit in that row? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number in the input is reduced by 1, but only if it's greater than 1. So 2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2, etc., but 1 remains 1.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a 9, which becomes 8. 4 becomes 3, as seen in the sixth row. The input has a 7, which maybe becomes 6. So maybe it's subtracting 1.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has a 9, which becomes 7. That doesn't fit. So perhaps it's not a simple subtraction.\n\nWait, let me look at the output of Example 2 again. The second row in the input is 0,8,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,0. The output is 0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So the two 8s become 7s. Hmm, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number is reduced by 1, but if it's in a certain position.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number in the input is replaced by the digit 7 in the output if the input number is 8 or 9, and by the input number minus 1 otherwise.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the input has a 9, which becomes 8 in the output. If it's 8 or 9, it becomes 7. Wait, no, in the output, the third row has 0s and 8, which corresponds to the input having 9. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero number greater than 1 is reduced by 1, but 1 remains 1.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the input has 9, which becomes 7 in the output. So that supports the idea that non-zero numbers greater than 1 are reduced by 1.\n\nLet me test this against another part. In Example 2, the input has a 7, which becomes 7 in the output. So if it's 1 or 0, it remains the same.\n\nSo the rule could be: any non-zero number in the input is reduced by 1 if it's greater than 1; otherwise, it remains the same.\n\nLet me see if this holds for all examples.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- The third row has a 9, which becomes 8.\n- The sixth row has two 8s, which become 7 and 7.\n- The twelfth row has two 0s, which remain 0.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\n- The first row is all zeros.\n- The second row has two 8s, which become 7 and 7.\n- The third row has three 8s, which become 7,7,7.\n- The fourth row is all zeros.\n- The fifth row has a 7, which remains 7.\n- The sixth row has two 7s, which remain 7s.\n- The seventh row is all zeros.\n- The eighth row has three 7s, which remain 7s.\n- The ninth row is all zeros.\n- The tenth row is all zeros.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all the examples. So the rule is: any non-zero number in the input grid is replaced by the number minus 1, but if the number is 1, it remains 1.\n\nSo for any cell in the input grid, if the value is greater than 1, subtract 1 from it; if it's 1 or 0, leave it as is.\n\nNow, I need to apply this rule to the input given in Example 2 and see what the output should be.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has a 9, which becomes 7, and an 8, which becomes 7. So yes, the rule applies.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the input grid of Example 2, the output should be as described.\n\nNow, to apply this rule to Example 1:\n\n- The third row has a 9, which becomes 8.\n- The sixth row has two 8s, which become 7s.\n- The twelfth row has two 0s, which remain 0s.\n\nSo, the output for Example 1 is as given.\n\nSimilarly, for the other examples, applying the same rule should give the correct outputs.\n\nI think this is the correct rule. Now, I'll apply it to the input in Example 2 to generate the output.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully examining the examples provided and see if I can identify any patterns or similarities between the inputs and outputs.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput has multiple 0s and one 1 at the end. The output seems to have 0s and 1s arranged in a specific pattern. Each output row alternates between 0 and 1, but the starting point changes. The first output row starts with 0, the second with 1, then 0 again, and so on.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is similar with 0s and a single 1. The output is also a series of 0s and 1s, arranged in a way that each row starts with 0 or 1, but not in the same alternating pattern as Example 1. Instead, the starting point seems to be different, perhaps rotating or changing based on some rule.\n\nExample 3 is the same structure as the previous examples. The output rows start with 0, then 1, followed by combinations of 0s and 1s, but the exact pattern is consistent across the examples.\n\nFrom these observations, I notice that the output rows are all starting with 0, followed by a pattern of 1s and combinations. However, in Example 1, the output doesn't always start with 0. Wait, no, in Example 1, the output starts with 0, then alternates. But in Example 2, the output starts with 0, 1, 0, and so on. Wait, no, let me check that again.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output starts with 0, then 1, then 0, 1, and so on. But in Example 2, the output starts with 0, then 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, etc. Wait no, in Example 2, the output has 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, etc., but the first row is 0,1,0,1,0,1, then 0,0,1,0,0,1, etc. Hmm, that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output grid is a rotated version of the input grid, but in a specific way. For example, in Example 1, the input is all 0s except the last row which is 0 0 0 0 1, and the output seems to be a right shift of the input rows, but starting with 0.\n\nLet me try to think about rotation. If the input is a 10x5 grid (since it has 10 rows and 5 columns), rotating right by one would bring the last column to the first position. So, the input's last row would become the first column in the rotated grid. But in the output of Example 1, the first output row is 0 1, which doesn't fit a right shift. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a left shift of the input. Let's see. The input's last row is 0 0 0 0 1, which would become the first column in the output. So the first output row would be 0 0 0 0 1, but in the example, the first row is 0 1. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it's a different kind of shift. Perhaps each row in the output is a permutation of the corresponding row in the input. Looking at Example 1, the first output row is 0 1, which could be swapping the 0 and 1 from the last input row. The second row is 1 0, which is the same as the first row but swapped. The third row is 0 1 again. So it seems like the output is alternating between 0 1 and 1 0 for all rows, except the last row, which is 1 0. Wait, no, the last row is 1 0, but the first few are 0 1 and 1 0.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the input rows and flipping them in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the output rows start with 0, then 1, then 0, then 1, and so on. The first few rows are 0 1, 1 0, 0 1, 1 0, etc. So it's alternating between 0 1 and 1 0.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is similar, but the output starts with 0 1 0. Wait, but in Example 1, the output starts with 0 1, then 1 0, etc. But in Example 2, the output is 0 1 0, then 1 0 0, then 0 1 0, then 0 0 1, etc. Hmm, that seems different.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output is a reflection of the input. For example, in Example 1, the input's last row is 0 0 0 0 1, which becomes the first column in the output. So the first output row is 0 1, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the output is a rotation by 180 degrees, but that would make the last row the first row, but the output starts with 0 1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's look at the inputs and outputs more carefully.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 10x5 grid with all 0s except the last row, which is 0 0 0 0 1. The output is a 10x5 grid where each row alternates between 0 1 and 1 0, starting with 0 1 for the first row, then 1 0 for the second, then 0 1 for the third, and so on, ending with 0 1 for row 10.\n\nWait, that doesn't quite match. The output rows are 0 1, 1 0, 0 1, 1 0, etc., but the last row is 0 1. So perhaps the output is constructed by taking the input rows and flipping them in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by rotating the input rows by 180 degrees. For example, the last row becomes the first row, but the input's last row is 0 0 0 0 1, so in the output, it becomes the first row, which is 0 1, but that's not matching. Wait, no, in Example 1, the first output row is 0 1, which could be the last column of the input's last row.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and for each row, taking the elements in reverse order, except for the last element. For example, the input's last row is 0 0 0 0 1, so in the output, each row is reversed, so 1 0 0 0 0. But in the output, the first row is 0 1, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by rotating the input's rows to the left by one, but that would cause the last row to become the first, and so on. But in Example 1, the first output row is 0 1, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each row in the output is the corresponding row in the input, but with the last element moved to the front. For example, if the input row is 0 0 0 0 1, the output row would be 1 0 0 0 0. But in Example 1, the first output row is 0 1, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows and permuting them in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output rows are 0 1, 1 0, 0 1, 1 0, etc., which is a pattern of 0 1 followed by 1 0, repeated.\n\nWait, that could be the case. So, the output alternates between 0 1 and 1 0 for each row. The first output row is 0 1, the second is 1 0, the third is 0 1, and so on, ending with 0 1. Similarly, in Example 2, the output starts with 0 1 0, then 1 0 0, then 0 1 0, etc. So it's a pattern where the first element alternates between 0 and 1, followed by the second element, and so on.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output starts with 0 0 0 1, which would fit this pattern. So perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the input rows, where the elements are arranged in a certain order, and this order is determined by a pattern.\n\nSo, to summarize, the rule seems to be that each output row is a permutation of the input rows, arranged in a specific order. The permutation alternates between 0 and 1 in a certain way, and this pattern repeats for each row.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Example 3, the input is a 10x4 grid with the last row as 0 0 0 0 1. Wait, no, in Example 3, the input is a 10x4 grid with the last row as 1 0 0 0. The output is a 10x4 grid where each output row is a permutation of the input rows, arranged in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output rows are formed by taking the input rows and permuting them in a way that the first element alternates between 0 and 1, followed by the second element, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by rotating the input rows to the left by one position, but that doesn't seem to fit the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output is formed by taking the input rows and permuting them in a specific order, such as taking the first element of each row in a certain pattern and placing them in the output rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows are all 0s except the last row, which is 0 0 0 0 1. The output rows are 0 1, 1 0, 0 1, 1 0, etc., which suggests that the output rows are formed by taking the last element of the input rows in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the last element of each row in the input, arranged in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the last elements of each input row (except the last row) are all 0, and the last element of the last row is 1. So in the output, the first row starts with 0, then 1, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the output rows are formed by taking the last element of each input row and placing them in order, starting with the last row's last element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a left shift of the input, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the output is formed by taking the input rows and permuting them such that the first element alternates between 0 and 1, followed by the second element, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output rows are formed by taking the input rows and permuting them such that the first element alternates between 0 and 1, and the second element alternates between 1 and 0, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output rows are formed by taking the input rows and reversing them, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to find a pattern by looking at the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output rows are 0 1, 1 0, 0 1, 1 0, etc. So it's a pattern of 0 1 followed by 1 0, repeated.\n\nIn Example 2, the output rows are 0 1 0, 1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1, etc. So it's a more complex pattern, perhaps alternating between 0 1 0 and 1 0 0, and then 0 1 0 again, etc.\n\nIn Example 3, the output rows are 0 0 0 1, 0 0 1 0, 0 1 0 0, 1 0 0 0, etc., which seems to follow a pattern of shifting the elements in a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the input rows, where the elements are arranged in a certain order based on their position in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output is formed by taking the input rows and permuting them such that the first element of each output row is 0, followed by 1, then 0, and so on, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output rows are formed by taking the input rows and permuting them such that the first element alternates between 0 and 1, then the second element alternates between 1 and 0, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output rows are formed by taking the input rows and permuting them in a way that the first element alternates between 0 and 1, followed by the second element in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find a general rule that applies to all examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the output grid is formed by taking the input grid and permuting its rows in a specific way. The permutation alternates between 0 and 1 in a certain pattern.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output rows are 0 1, 1 0, 0 1, 1 0, etc., which suggests that the output rows are formed by taking the last element of each input row, starting with the last row's last element.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the output rows are 0 1 0, 1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1, etc., which suggests that the output rows are formed by taking the last three elements of each input row, starting with the last row's last three elements.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input is 10 rows with 5 columns each, and the output is also 10 rows with 5 columns. So perhaps the rule is that the output rows are formed by taking the last element of each input row, arranged in order.\n\nSo, for example, in Example 1, the input rows (except the last one) have a 0 in the last column, and the last input row has a 1. So the output rows are 0 1, 1 0, 0 1, 1 0, etc.\n\nIn Example 2, the input rows (except the last one) have a 0 in the last column, and the last input row has a 0 and a 1. So the output rows are 0 1 0, 1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1, etc.\n\nIn Example 3, the input rows (except the last one) have a 0 in the last column, and the last input row has a 1 and a 0. So the output rows are 0 0 0 1, 0 0 1 0, 0 1 0 0, 1 0 0 0, etc.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be that each output row is formed by taking the last element of the corresponding input row, in order, starting from the last row.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the last row is 0 0 0 0 1, so the output first row is 0 1. Then the next row is 1 0, which would be the last element of the second last row (0 0 0 0 0) and the last element of the last row (0 0 0 0 1), but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the last element of each input row, starting from the last row to the first row.\n\nWait, let's see. In Example 1, the input rows are:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\n\n...\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 1\n\nSo the last elements (column 5) are all 0, except the last row which is 1. So the output rows would be 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 in the first row, then 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 for the second, etc., but that doesn't fit the output.\n\nWait, the output for Example 1 is:\n\n0 1\n\n1 0\n\n0 1\n\n1 0\n\n0 1\n\n1 0\n\n0 1\n\n1 0\n\n0 1\n\n1 0\n\nSo the first row is 0 1, which is the last element of the last row (0 0 0 0 1) and the first element of the first row (0 0 0 0 0). Hmm, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the last element of each input row, but in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output rows are formed by taking the last element of each input row in order, starting from the last row to the first row.\n\nIn Example 1, the last element of each input row (from last to first) is 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the output would be 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the last element of each input row, starting from the first row to the last row.\n\nIn Example 1, the last elements are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, and the first elements are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are three examples given, each with their own input and output grids. I need to figure out what rule is being applied and then apply it to a new input grid.\n\nLet me start by looking at Example 1. The input grid is a 10x2 matrix filled mostly with zeros, except for a single row which has a 1. The output grid has a pattern where each output row is a permutation of the input rows. The output seems to be a rotation or some kind of transformation of the input.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the input grid is 10x3 with a single 1 in the last row, and the output grid is a 10x3 matrix where each output row is a permutation of the input rows. Again, there's a transformation happening that's not just a simple swap.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input is a 10x4 matrix with a single 1 in the last row, and the output is a 10x4 matrix where each row is a different permutation of the input rows. So, it seems like the output is a cyclic shift of the input rows, but perhaps in a specific pattern.\n\nWait, in all examples, the output grid has a specific number of rows equal to the input grid. For example, the first example has 10 input rows and 10 output rows, but let me check the actual numbers.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 10 rows, each with 2 elements. The output has 10 rows, each with 2 elements as well. Similarly, Example 2 has 10 rows of 3 elements, and the output has 10 rows of 3 elements. Example 3 is the same with 4 elements. So, the number of rows remains the same, but the number of columns changes.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output rows seem to be a rotation of the input rows. Let me see: the input is 0s and a single 1. The output rows are 0 1, 1 0, and so on. So perhaps each output row is a right shift of the input rows.\n\nWait, if the input is 0 0 ... 1 0, then shifting right would make it 0 ... 0 1? Wait, not exactly. Let me think about the output.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 10 rows, each with two elements. The output has 10 rows, each with two elements. The first output row is 0 1, which is swapping the two 0s and the two 1s, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the input has 10 0s and one 1. The output has 10 rows, each with one 1 and one 0. So the output grid is a grid where each row has exactly one 1 and one 0, appearing in a rotated manner.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a right cyclic shift of the input rows. So, if the input rows are ordered, the output rows are the same as the input rows but rotated right by one position. Let me check with Example 1.\n\nInput rows are all 0s except for the last row which is 1 0. Rotating right by one gives 0 1 for the last row. Wait, but that's the first output row. So maybe it's a left cyclic shift. Let me see: rotating left, the last element moves to the front. So the last row 1 0 would become 0 1, which is the first output row. Then, the next rows would be rotated left. So the next row after that would be 0 1 rotated left becomes 1 0, which is the second output row. Wait, in Example 1, the output rows are 0 1, 1 0, 0 1, etc. So yes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, the rule is that each output row is a left cyclic shift of the corresponding input row. So for each row in the input, the output row is the same as the input row shifted left by one. If the row is longer than one element, this shift would cause the first element to move to the end.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, each input row is two elements. So shifting left would make the first element move to the end. So, for example, the last row input is [1, 0], shifting left would become [0, 1], which is the first output row. The next row is [0, 0], shifting left becomes [0, 0] again, which is the second output row. The third row is [1, 0], shifting left becomes [0, 1], which is the third output row, and so on.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has the first row as [0, 1], then the next as [1, 0], then [0, 1], etc. So each output row is a shift of the corresponding input row. That seems consistent.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Example 2, where the input is 10 rows of 3 elements and one 1 in the last row (1, 0, 0). So, each input row is a 3-element vector. The output should be a grid where each output row is the input row shifted left by one. So for example, the last row input is [1, 0, 0], shifting left becomes [0, 0, 1], which is the first output row. The next row is [0, 0, 0], shifting left becomes [0, 0, 0], which is the second output row. The third row is [0, 0, 0], same as above. Then the next row is [0, 0, 0], etc., until the last row, which is [0, 0, 1], shifting left becomes [0, 1, 0], which is the last output row.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output has 10 rows, each shifted left. So that matches.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the input is 10 rows of 4 elements with a single 1 in the last row (1, 0, 0, 0). Shifting left would give [0, 0, 0, 1], which is the first output row. The next row would be [0, 0, 0, 0], shifting left remains the same. The next row is [0, 0, 0, 0], same as above. The last row is [0, 0, 0, 1], shifting left becomes [0, 0, 1, 0], which is the last output row.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each input row, the corresponding output row is the input row shifted left by one. If the row has only one element, shifting left doesn't change it.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid. The test input is a 10x5 matrix with all 0s except the last row, which is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Shifting left once gives [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], which is the first output row. The next row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], shifting left remains the same. This pattern continues for the next rows until the last row, which is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], shifting left becomes [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], which is the last output row.\n\nSo, the output grid should have 10 rows, each shifted left from the corresponding input row. So, each output row is a rotation of the input row by one position to the left.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are three examples provided, and I should look for a pattern or rule that applies across them. Let me try to analyze each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n...\n1 0\n\nThe output is a grid where each row alternates between 0 and 1, but the direction seems to depend on the position of the 1 in the input. For instance, the first row of the input has both 0s, and the output starts with 0,1,0,1, etc. Wait, actually, looking closer, the output seems to be a cyclic shift. Each row in the output is a rotation of the previous row. For example, the first output row is 0,1,0,1, and the next is 1,0,1,0, and so on. So, it looks like the output is a right rotation by one position.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n...\n1 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n...\n0 1 0\n\nHere, each row in the output is again a right rotation of the input row. For example, the first input row is 0,0,0, and the output starts with 0,1,0. Wait, that doesn't seem like a right rotation. Maybe it's a left rotation? Let me check:\n\nIf I have 0,0,0 and rotate left by one, I get 0,0,0, which doesn't match the output. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's shifting based on the position of the 1. Let me look at the output rows.\n\nThe first output row is 0,1,0. The input row is 0,0,0. So the 1 is in the second position. Maybe the output is taking the 1 and shifting it to the next position. But the second output row is 1,0,0, which has the 1 in the first position. So it seems like the output is taking the 1 from the input and shifting it to the next position, cycling through the columns.\n\nWait, but in the first output row, the 1 is in position 2, and the next output row has it in position 1, then 3, and so on. So it's a cyclic shift. So perhaps the rule is that each 1 in the input grid shifts to the next column in the output, and the last column wraps around to the first.\n\nLet me test this with Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n...\n1 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n\nLooking at the first output row: 0,0,0,1. The input has a 1 in the fourth column. The output shifts this 1 to the first column. The next output row has 1 in the third column, which is shifted from the second row's 1 in the fourth column. Wait, no, the second output row has 1 in the third column, which is the third column of the input. So maybe the 1 shifts to the next column each time.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each 1 in the input grid moves to the next column in the output, and the last column wraps around to the first. Let me see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 1 in the last column, and the output starts with 1,0,1,0,... So that fits. Similarly, in Example 2, the input has 1 in the last column, and the output starts with 1,0,0, but wait, that doesn't fit because the last output row is 0,1,0,0. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1 in the input is moved to the next column, and the last column wraps around. So, for each 1, it shifts to the next column, and the last column becomes the first.\n\nLet me test this with Example 3:\n\nInput has 1 in column 4 (0-indexed, it's the last). So in the output, the 1 is in column 1. The first output row has 1 in column 1. The next output row has 1 in column 3, which is correct. The third output row has 1 in column 4, but the input has 1 in column 4, so it wraps around to column 1. Wait, no, the third output row has 1 in column 4, which is the last column, so it wraps around to column 1? Or does it wrap around to the previous column? Let me check the output rows:\n\nFirst output: 0,0,0,1 \u2192 1 in column 4.\nSecond output: 0,0,1,0 \u2192 1 in column 3.\nThird output: 0,1,0,0 \u2192 1 in column 2.\nFourth output: 1,0,0,0 \u2192 1 in column 1.\nThen it repeats: 0,1,0,0, 1,0,0,0, etc.\n\nSo, it's indeed a cyclic shift where each 1 moves to the next column, and the last column wraps around to the first.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: For each row, shift the 1 in the input grid to the next column. If it's in the last column, it wraps around to the first column.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Example 3:\n\nInput has 1 in column 4. So in the output, it's in column 1. The other 0s are shifted accordingly.\n\nSo, in Example 1, the input has a 1 in column 0 (since it's the first row). So in the output, it's shifted to column 1, but looking at the output, the first output row is 0,1,0,1. Wait, that doesn't fit because it's shifted to column 1, but the output starts with 0,1,0,1.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift is circular, and the output rows are shifted by one each time, leading to a pattern where each row is a right shift of the previous row.\n\nSo, for the first row, the 1 is in column 0, so shifted right, it's in column 1. But the first output row starts with 0,1,0,1, which is a right shift by one. Wait, but the first input row is 0,0,... and the output's first row is 0,1,0,1, which is a right shift by one from the input, but the input row is all 0s except for the last element, which is 0. So maybe the rule is that each 1 is shifted to the next column, and the last column wraps to the first.\n\nSo, applying this to Example 3:\n\nInput has 1 in column 4 (since it's row 0). So in the output, it's shifted to column 1. The other 0s are shifted accordingly.\n\nSo, for each row, the 1 is shifted to the next column. The last column wraps around to the first.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: For each row in the input, shift all elements right by one, with the last element wrapping around to the first position. So, each element in the output row is the previous element in the input row, and the first element is the last element of the input row.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input grid:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput rows will be:\n\nFor the first row, the input is 0,0,0,0,0. Shifting right by one, the last element (0) wraps around to the first. So the output is 0,0,0,0,0. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the input has a 1 in the 10th column (last column). Wait, no, the input is 0,0,0,0,0. So shifting right would make it 0,0,0,0,0 again. But the input's last element is 0, so wrapping around would make it 0 in the first position, but the output's first element is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the shift. Let me think again.\n\nEach row in the input is shifted right by one, with the last element wrapping around to the first. So, for a row [a, b, c, d, e], the output row would be [e, a, b, c, d].\n\nSo, applying this to the test input grid:\n\nThe input has a 1 in the last column (column 4, 0-indexed). So for each row, we need to shift right by one, and wrap around.\n\nLooking at the test input grid:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 shifted becomes 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 shifted becomes 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 shifted becomes 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 shifted becomes 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 shifted becomes 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 shifted becomes 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 shifted becomes 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 shifted becomes 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 shifted becomes 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 shifted becomes 0 1 0 0 0\n\nSo, the output grid would be:\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n\nWait, but the last row has 0 1 0 0 0, which is correct because the last element of the input is 0, so it wraps around to the first position. The 1 is shifted to the second position, and the rest follow.\n\nSo, the rule is clear now. Each row in the output is a right shift of the corresponding row in the input, with the last element wrapping around to the first position.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me check Example 2. The input here is a grid of 10 rows and 3 columns, with the last row having a 1 in the first column. The output is a grid of 10 rows and 3 columns as well. The first few rows of the output seem to be similar to the input's first two columns, except the third column is shifted. Hmm, maybe there's a rotation involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the third example. It's an 11-row grid with 4 columns. The first ten rows are all zeros except the last one, which has a 1. The output is a grid where each row is a cyclic shift of the previous one. The first row is 0 0 0 1, then 0 0 1 0, then 0 1 0 0, then 1 0 0 0, and this pattern repeats for the last four rows. So, it seems like the output rows are cyclic permutations of the input.\n\nPutting it all together, it looks like the rule is that each row in the output is a cyclic shift of the corresponding row in the input, and the output grid is formed by applying this shift to each row of the input. In Example 1, the input is a grid where one row is 1 followed by zeros, and the output is 0 followed by 1 in the corresponding position for that row. Then, the other rows follow a similar pattern.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row in the output, it's a cyclic shift of the corresponding row in the input. Since the input row in Example 1 is 1 0, shifting it would result in 0 1 for the output, and this pattern repeats for the next rows.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The output grid has a 1 in the last row and zeros elsewhere. It seems like the 1 is moving from its position in the input to the last row of the output.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a single 1 in the last row of the input grid, and the output moves this 1 to the first row of the output grid. \n\nIn Example 3, the input has a single 1 in the last row of the input grid, and the output moves this 1 to the first row of the output grid as well.\n\nFrom these observations, it looks like the rule is: when a 1 is in the last row of the input grid, it moves to the first row of the output grid. All other 1s stay in their positions or move according to some consistent rule.\n\nSo, for any input grid, if there's a single 1 in the last row, it moves to the first position of the output grid. Otherwise, the 1 stays wherever it is.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the user's test input grid:\n\nThe input grid has a 1 in the last row (position 9, if we index from 0).

Let's start by analyzing the examples provided to figure out what rule is at play here.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a bunch of zeros and a single 1 in the last row. The output grid seems to be a rotation of the input, with the 1 moving around in a cycle. Specifically, the 1 moves from the last row to the second row, then to the first row, and so on. The output alternates between 0s and 1s, but in a specific pattern.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is similar with a single 1 near the end. The output grid shifts the 1 in a circular manner as well, but the direction seems to be different. The output starts with 0,1,0 and then shifts, which suggests that the rotation direction might depend on the number of zeros in the input.\n\nNow, looking at Example 3, it's the same setup but with more zeros before the 1. The output also shows a rotation, but the pattern of zeros around the 1 changes. The output grid has a rotation that cycles through different positions, but the direction and the sequence of zeros are consistent with the previous examples.\n\nBased on these observations, the rule involves rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise each time. The single 1 moves around the grid in a circular path, and the surrounding zeros shift accordingly. The direction of rotation depends on the position of the 1, starting from the last row and moving clockwise.\n\nTo confirm this, let's consider the first example where the 1 is in the last row. After a 90-degree rotation, it moves to the second row, then to the first, and the pattern continues. The same applies to the other examples, where the rotation follows the same pattern regardless of the number of zeros before the 1.\n\nTherefore, the rule is to rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise, with the 1 moving in a circular path around the center of the grid. This rotation should be applied to each element in the grid, shifting their positions accordingly and maintaining the same structure of zeros around the 1.\n\nSince the input in Example 1 has 10 zeros and then a 1 in the last row, the output should also follow a 90-degree rotation pattern. The same logic applies to Examples 2 and 3, where the 1 is placed differently, but the rotation remains consistent.\n\nIn the last example provided, the 1 is in the fifth column of the last row. After a 90-degree rotation, it should move to the fifth column of the second-to-last row, then to the fifth column of the third-to-last row, and so on, following the same circular path.\n\nSo, to predict the output grid, I need to perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation on the input grid, ensuring that the 1 moves in the circular pattern described.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, we have an input grid and an output grid, and we need to find the rule that transforms the input to the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a bunch of 0s and one 1. The output has 0s and 1s arranged in a specific pattern. Each row in the output seems to be a rotation of the input's 1s. For example, the first output row is 0 1, then 1 0, then 0 1, and so on. It looks like a 90-degree rotation, but applied multiple times.\n\nWait, let's check that. The input has the 1 in the first column, row 1. The output's first row is 0 1, which would be a right rotation. The next row is 1 0, which is another right rotation. So, it seems each row is a 90-degree rotation of the previous one. That makes sense because the input has all 0s except for the first column, and the output arranges the 1s in a circular manner.\n\nNow, checking Example 2, the input has the 1 in the first column, row 10. The output places this 1 in the last column, row 10. So, it's the same as moving the 1 from the first column to the last column, which is a 90-degree rotation. Similarly, in Example 3, the input has the 1 in the first column, row 10, and the output's 1 is in the last column, row 10 after rotation.\n\nSo, the rule is to rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise. Each row in the output corresponds to a column in the input, but the order is reversed. For example, the first row of the output is the first column of the input, but reversed. Wait, no, in Example 1, the first output row is 0 1, which is the first column from top to bottom. The second output row is 1 0, which is the same column but reversed. So, it's a 90-degree rotation.\n\nTherefore, the rule is to rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise. Now, applying this rule to the given test input grid, which has the 1 in the first column, row 10, we need to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

So, we have two examples where an input grid is transformed into an output grid, and I need to find the rule that connects them. Then, apply that rule to the given test input grid.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input grid has a bunch of zeros, and one 1 in the first row. The output grid seems to have the 1 moved in a specific way. The first row becomes 0 1, then the next row is 1 0, and this pattern repeats. So, it looks like the 1 is being rotated 90 degrees clockwise each time it moves to a new position.\n\nWait, let me check Example 2. The input here has a 1 in the last row, and the output also moves it, but this time, it seems like it's being shifted in a different way. Maybe the rule isn't just rotation; perhaps there's another transformation happening.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 1 in the last row, and the output shows the 1 moving around in a circular pattern. It starts at the first column, then moves to the second, then third, and back to the fourth. But since the last row has two 1s, maybe it's a rotation but also considering the position of the 1s.\n\nPutting this together, I think the rule involves shifting the 1 in the grid in a specific pattern. It starts at the first column and moves to the next, but when it reaches the end, it wraps around to the beginning. This seems consistent across all examples. So, for any grid, the 1 is moved one position to the right each time, in a circular manner, and when it hits the last column, it starts again from the first.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The input has a single 1 in the first row. Applying the rule, it should move one column to the right, making it 0 1. Then, since there are 5 rows, the output has five such 1s, each moving one column to the right. That matches the given output.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 1 in the last row. After applying the rule, it should move to the second column, but since the output shows it in the second column, that makes sense.\n\nExample 3: The input has a 1 in the last row. Applying the rule, it moves to the second column, then the third, then the fourth, and then wraps around again to the first. But since the output shows the 1 moving in a circular way, that fits as well.\n\nSo, the rule is: Shift the 1 in the grid one column to the right, and when it reaches the end, it wraps around to the beginning, moving each time in a rightward direction.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid. The test input has a 1 in the last row, first column. After shifting right once, it should be in the second column. Then, each subsequent shift moves it to the next column. Since there are five columns, after shifting four times, it wraps around. So, the 1 should end up in the fifth column, which is column 5 in the output.\n\nWait, but in the output, the first row is 0 0 0 1. So, the 1 is in the fourth column, which is column 4. That doesn't match my initial thought. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to rotate all the 1s in the grid. For example, in each row, the 1 moves to the next column, and the last column wraps around to the first. Let me check Example 1 again. The input is 1 row with a 1 in the first column. After shifting, the output starts with 0 1, which is moving the 1 to the second column. Then, in the next row, it's 1 0, which is moving the 1 to the third column. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are being rotated in a specific way. Maybe the 1 in the first row is moved to the first column of the next row, then to the second, and so on. But in Example 1, the output has 0s in the first row, and the 1s are in the second, third, etc. So, perhaps each 1 is shifted down by one row, and the last row wraps around to the first.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1 again. The input has a single 1 in the first row. The output has five 1s, each in the row below, except for the last one which is shifted to the first column. So, it seems like the 1 is being moved down each time, and when it reaches the last row, it wraps around to the first row.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the input has a 1 in the last row. The output shows this 1 moving to the second column. So, it's like the 1 is shifting down each time, but when it reaches the end, it wraps around.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 1 in the last row. The output shows this 1 moving to the second column, then the third, fourth, and back to the first. So, each 1 is moving down each time, wrapping around when necessary.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: Each 1 in the grid is shifted down by one row, and when it reaches the last row, it wraps around to the first row. This shifting occurs for all 1s in the grid, moving each down by one, with wrapping around.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input grid: The last row has a 1 in column 1. Shifting it down, it would wrap around to the first row, column 1. Then, the next 1s in the last row would shift down, but since there are 5 columns, after shifting four times, it wraps around again. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nEach 1 in the last row moves down by one, with the last row wrapping to the first. So, in the test input, the last row has a 1 in column 1. After shifting, it would be in column 1 of the first row. But looking at Example 1, the output's first row is 0 1, which is after shifting. So, perhaps each 1 in the last row is moving down to the next row, with the last row's 1 moving to the first row.\n\nWait, perhaps each 1 is moving down one row, with the last row's 1 moving to the first row. So, in the test input, the last row has a 1 in column 1. After shifting, it would be in column 1 of the first row, and the other 1s in the last row (columns 2-5) would move down to the next rows.\n\nBut in the output, the first row is 0 0 0 0 1. Wait, no, the output for the test input should have the 1 in the first row, column 5. Because each 1 shifts down one row, and the last row's 1 wraps around to the first row.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nEach 1 in the last row moves down to the next row, and the last row's 1 wraps around to the first row. So, for the test input, the last row has a 1 in column 1. After shifting, it would be in column 1 of the first row. Then, the other 1s in the last row (columns 2-5) would shift down to the next rows, but since there are 5 columns, they wrap around.\n\nBut in the test input, the last row is the 10th row (assuming rows are numbered 0-9 as in the examples). So, the 1 in column 1 would shift down to row 0, column 1. Then, the other 1s in columns 2-5 would shift down to rows 1-4. But since we have 5 columns, shifting down by one would make column 5 wrap around to column 1.\n\nWait, perhaps each 1 is shifted down by one, and the last row's 1 wraps around to the first row. So, in the test input, the 1 in the last row is moved down to the first row, column 1. Then, the other 1s in the last row (columns 2-5) move down to rows 1-4, respectively.\n\nBut in the output, the first row is 0 0 0 0 1. So, that matches the 1 moving to the first row, column 1. The other rows would have 0s, except for the 1 in the first row.\n\nWait, but in the test input, there are 10 rows. So, shifting each 1 down by one would move them into the next row, except the 1 in the last row would wrap around to the first row.\n\nSo, the 1 in row 9 (last row) would move to row 0, column 1. Then, the 1s in columns 2-5 in row 9 would move to rows 1-4, respectively. But in the output, the first row is 0 0 0 0 1, which suggests that the 1 is in the first row, column 1. The other rows in the first column are 0. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the rule is:\n\n- For each 1 in the input grid, shift it down by one row.\n- If it's in the last row, it wraps around to the first row.\n- All other 1s (if any) remain in their positions or move accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the examples, there are no other 1s besides the one in the last row. So, for the test input, only the 1 in the last row moves down to the first row. The other rows in the first column are 0.\n\nSo, the output grid should have a 1 in the first row, column 1, and 0s elsewhere. But let me check Example 1 again.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a single row with a 1 in column 0. The output is a row with 0 and 1. So, it seems like the 1 is moving down to the next row, but in this case, there are no rows below it. So, perhaps each 1 is shifted down by one, with the last row's 1 moving to the first row.\n\nTherefore, applying this rule to the test input, the 1 will move from the last row, column 1 to the first row, column 1. The other rows in the first column will remain 0.\n\nSo, the output grid should be:\n\n0 0 0 0 1\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in Example 1, the output has 5 rows, each with a 1 in the second, third, etc., positions. So, perhaps the rule is to rotate the 1 in a specific way, not just shift down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1 is being rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Let me see: In Example 1, the input has a 1 in the first row, and the output has 0 1 in the first row, which suggests a vertical rotation.\n\nWait, perhaps the 1 is being rotated 90 degrees clockwise each time it moves to a new position. So, in the first row, it's at the end and becomes the first element in the next row.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row after rotation has 0 1, which suggests that the 1 is moved to the first element of the next row.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the last row's 1 is moved to the second column, then to the third, and so on.\n\nSo, the rule is: The 1 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise each time it moves to a new position.\n\nTherefore, in the test input, the 1 in the last row moves to the first column of the first row, and all other rows in the first column are 0.\n\nSo, the output grid should be a single row with 0s except for the last element, which is 1.\n\nWait, but in the test input, there are 10 rows, so the output should have 10 rows. So, the first row would be 0 0 0 0 1, and the other rows would be 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nBut let me check Example 3. The input has a 1 in the last row, column 1. After rotation, it moves to the second column, then third, and wraps around. So, the output would have 1s in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the first three rows, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has 1s in the second, third, etc., positions of the rows. So, perhaps the rule is to shift the 1 in each row to the next column, and when it reaches the end, it wraps around to the beginning.\n\nTherefore, the rule is:\n\n1. For each row, shift the 1 in the current column to the next column.\n2. If it's in the last column, it wraps around to the first column.\n3. If there are no more columns, it remains in the same row.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input:\n\n- The last row has a 1 in column 1. Shifting it to the next column, it wraps around to column 5. So, the 1 is in column 5 of the first row.\n- The other 1s in the last row (columns 2-5) would shift down to the next rows, wrapping around as needed.\n\nBut looking at the test input, there are 10 rows. So, the 1 in the last row would move down to the first row, column 5. Then, the 1s in columns 2-5 in the last row would move down to rows 1-4, respectively.\n\nSo, the first row after shifting would have 0 0 0 0 1. The other rows would have 0 0 0 0 0, except for the 1s in the first four rows of the last row.\n\nWait, but in the test input, all other rows have 0s. So, after shifting, the only 1 is in the first row, column 5.\n\nTherefore, the output grid should be:\n\n0 0 0 0 1\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, but that seems too simplistic. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1 is being rotated 90 degrees clockwise for each movement. So, in the first row, it's at the end, and after rotating 90 degrees, it's in the last column of the first column.\n\nSimilarly, in the second row, the 1 is in the last column, which after rotation, becomes the last column of the previous row, but this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1 is being rotated 90 degrees clockwise each time it moves to a new position, meaning that the 1 in the first row moves to the first column, then the 1 in the second row moves to the second column, etc., and the last row's 1 wraps around to the first column.\n\nSo, in the test input, the 1 is in the last row, column 1. Shifting it to the first column of the first row, making the output row 1 have 0 0 0 0 1, and the other rows remain 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nThat seems more plausible. So, the rule is that the 1 in each row is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to move to the next column, and the last row's 1 wraps around to the first column of the first row.\n\nTesting this with Example 1: The input has a 1 in row 0, column 0. After rotating 90 degrees, it moves to row 0, column 4 (since it's the first column, rotating 90 degrees clockwise would place it at the last column). So, the first row of the output would be 0 0 0 0 1, which matches the given output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the input has a 1 in row 9, column 0. Rotating 90 degrees clockwise would place it in row 0, column 4. So, the first row of the output would be 0 0 0 1 0, which matches the given output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 1 in row 9, column 0. Rotating 90 degrees clockwise would place it in row 0, column 4. Then, the other 1s in row 9 (columns 1-4) would rotate to row 1, columns 3-0, etc. Wait, but the output shows 1s in rows 1-4, columns 3-0. So, perhaps the rule is that each 1 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, which would change their positions accordingly.\n\nTherefore, applying this rule to the test input, where the only 1 is in the last row, column 1, it would rotate to the first column of the first row, resulting in the first row being 0 0 0 0 1, and the rest of the rows being 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo, the final output grid would be a single row with 0s except for the last element, which is 1, and the rest of the rows being 0.\n\nLet me summarize the rule:\n\n- Each 1 in the grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n- The 1 moves to the next column, wrapping around to the first column if it's in the last column.\n- This rotation occurs for all 1s in the grid.\n- If there are no more columns, the 1 remains in the same row.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input, the 1 in the last row, column 1, rotates to the first column", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 10x2 grid filled mostly with zeros except the last row which has a 1 followed by a 0. The output is a 10x2 grid where the first row has 0 and 1, then 1 and 0, alternating. It seems like the output is swapping the two elements in each pair, but starting with 0 and 1 in the first pair.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is a 10x3 grid with a 1 in the last row of the first column. The output is a 10x3 grid where each row after the first has the non-zero element in the first position, except the last two rows, which have the 0 in the second and third positions. So again, it seems like the rule is swapping the elements in each pair, but starting with 0 and 1 in the first column.\n\nMoving on to Example 3, the input is a 10x4 grid with a 1 in the last row of the first column. The output is a 10x4 grid where each row alternates between 0 and 1, but starting with 0 in the first row, then 1, and so on. This pattern suggests that the first element of each row is 0, and the second, third, and fourth elements alternate between 0 and 1, except for the first row where it starts with 1.\n\nPutting this all together, the rule appears to be: for each row in the input, if the first element is 1, then the output row starts with 1 and alternates between 0 and 1 for the remaining elements. If the first element is 0, the output row starts with 0 and alternates as well. \n\nTo test this, let's consider the input and output for each example. In Example 1, the input's first column is 0, so each output row should start with 0 and alternate. Looking at the output, it starts with 0,1, then 1,0, which matches. Similarly, in Example 2, the first column is 0, so the output starts with 0 and alternates, which is what we see.\n\nFor Example 3, the first column is 0, so the output starts with 0 and alternates. However, the last element in each row seems to be flipping between 0 and 1. Wait, in the output, the last element alternates every two rows. For example, the first output row ends with 1, the second with 0, the third with 1, and so on. So maybe the rule is that the first element is 1, and the rest alternate, but the last element flips every two rows. Alternatively, perhaps the last element is determined by the row number or position.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3, the output rows are as follows:\n\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\nSo the last element alternates between 1 and 0 every two rows. The first row ends with 1, the second with 0, the third with 1, and so on. This suggests that the last element is determined by the row index, perhaps starting from 1. So for row i, the last element is 1 if i is odd, 0 if even. But in the examples, the first row ends with 1, second with 0, third with 1, etc. So that seems consistent.\n\nPutting this all together, the rule for each output row is:\n\n- If the first element of the input row is 1, then the output row starts with 1 and alternates between 0 and 1 for the remaining elements.\n- If the first element is 0, the output row starts with 0 and alternates between 0 and 1 for the remaining elements.\n- Additionally, the last element of the output row alternates between 1 and 0 every two rows, starting with 1 in the first row.\n\nSo, to implement this, for each input row, we check the first element. If it's 1, we generate an output row starting with 1 and alternating. If it's 0, we start with 0 and alternate. Then, for the last element, we alternate between 1 and 0 every two rows.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid provided:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n\nEach row before the last is all zeros except the first. So for these rows, the first element is 0, so the output row starts with 0 and alternates. The last element alternates every two rows. Since the first row ends with 1, the second with 0, the third with 1, the fourth with 0, and so on.\n\nThe last row starts with 1, so the output row starts with 1 and alternates. Since there's no two rows after it, it just starts with 1 and alternates. So the last output row would be 1 0 0 0 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the output grid should be the same as the input, except the last row, which starts with 1 and alternates. So the output would be:\n\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0\n\nBut wait, in the examples, the last element in each row alternates every two rows, starting from the first. So for the first row, it's 1, second 0, third 1, fourth 0, fifth 1, sixth 0, seventh 1, eighth 0, ninth 1, and the last row starts with 1 and alternates.\n\nThus, the output should have the last row as 1 0 0 0 1, and the others as 0 0 0 0 alternating, starting with 1 in the first row.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid is 10 rows by 2 columns, and the output is also 10 rows by 2. Each row in the input has a 0 followed by a 1, except for the last row which is 1 followed by 0. The output rows seem to be a bit more complex. For instance, the first output row is 0 1, the second is 1 0, and this pattern repeats for each output row. So it looks like the rule is swapping the two elements in each row. \n\nLet me check Example 2. The input has 9 rows of 3 zeros and one row of 1 0 0. The output has 9 rows of 3 elements, each being 0, 1, 0 in a specific pattern. The first output row is 0 1 0, the second is 1 0 0, the third is 0 1 0, and so on. So again, it seems like the rule is swapping the elements, but not just any swap. It's swapping the second and third elements. \n\nWait, that doesn't fit with Example 1 exactly. In Example 1, the rule swaps the two elements, so the first becomes the second and vice versa. Looking at Example 2, the first output row is 0 1 0, which is the input row 0 0 0 becomes 0 1 0, so the second and third elements are swapped. The second output row is 1 0 0, which is the input row 1 0 0 becomes 1 0 0, so the first and third elements are swapped. Wait, that's not a consistent rule. \n\nLet me think again. Maybe the rule is that the first and last elements are swapped, and the middle elements are kept as they are. Let's test this with Example 1. The input has 0 0, and the output has 0 1. So swapping 0 and 0 would give 0 0, but the output is 0 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's the last element that's swapped with the first.\n\nWait, that might make sense. For the first output row in Example 1, the first element is 0, last is 1, so swapping them gives 1 0, but the output is 0 1. That doesn't match. Maybe the first and second elements are swapped. In the first row, 0 and 0 become 0 and 0, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe the rule is that the first and last elements are swapped, while the middle elements are kept. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nInput row: 0 0\nOutput row: 0 1\nIf we swap the first and last elements, 0 swaps with 0, which doesn't change anything, but the output is 0 1. So that doesn't fit. Maybe it's the middle elements that are swapped, but there are no middle elements here.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the first element becomes the second, and the second becomes the first, which is just swapping. That worked for Example 1 because each 0 and 1 are swapped. Let's check Example 2.\n\nInput row: 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 1 0\nSo the second element becomes 1, which is the first. That fits the swapping rule. The second element in the input is 0, and in the output, it's 1. So swapping works.\n\nLet me check the third element. In the input, it's 0, and in the output, it remains 0. So yes, swapping the second and third elements gives the correct output. So the rule seems to be swapping the second and third elements in each row.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the input has 9 rows of four zeros and one row of 1 0 0. The output is similar, swapping the second and third elements. For example, the first output row is 0 0 0 1, which is the input row 0 0 0 0 with the last element swapped to 0 0 0 1. Wait, no, that's not correct. The output is 0 0 0 1, which is the input 0 0 0 0 with the last element becoming 1. So again, swapping the last element with the first. Wait, that's not consistent.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has 0 0 0 0 followed by 1 0 0 0. The output has 0 0 0 1, then 0 0 1 0, then 0 1 0 0, etc. So for each row, the first and last elements are swapped. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 0 0, which becomes 0 0 0 1. The second row is 1 0 0 0, which becomes 0 0 1 0. Wait, but that's not consistent with the previous examples. Because in Example 1, the input had two elements, and the output had 0 1, which would be swapping the last element with the first, making 0 1. So maybe the rule is that the last element is swapped with the first in each row.\n\nLet me test this against all examples.\n\nExample 1: Each row has two elements. Swapping the last element with the first gives 0 1, which matches the output. \n\nExample 2: Each row has three elements. Swapping the last element with the first gives the correct output.\n\nExample 3: Each row has four elements. Swapping the last element with the first gives the correct output.\n\nSo the rule is that in each row, the first and last elements are swapped, while the middle elements remain as they are.\n\nTherefore, for the test input grid, which is 10 rows of 5 zeros and one row of 1 0 0 0, we need to apply this rule.\n\nSo for each row in the input:\n\n- If the row has 5 elements, swap the first and last elements.\n\n- If the row has 6 elements, swap the first and last elements.\n\nWait, but in the test input, each row is 5 elements. So for each row, swap the first and last elements.\n\nSo let's apply this.\n\nInput:\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n1 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput, after swapping first and last:\n\nFor the first 9 rows: 0 0 0 0 0 becomes 0 0 0 0 0 (since all are zeros), but wait, the last element is 0, so swapping with the first (0) gives the same. So all rows remain the same except the last one.\n\nThe last row is 1 0 0 0 0. Swapping first and last gives 0 0 0 0 1.\n\nTherefore, the output grid would be:\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 1\n\nWait, but in the test input, each row is 5 elements. So each row in the output would be the same as the input, except the last row, which has the first and last elements swapped.\n\nSo that's the conclusion.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples provided to see if I can figure out the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a grid of 10 zeros and one 1 at the bottom left corner. The output seems to be a grid where the 1 is rotated in a specific way. The output alternates between 0 and 1 in a pattern that looks like a checkerboard but shifted. For instance, the first row of the output is 0 1, followed by 1 0, and this pattern continues. It looks like the 1 is moving around the grid in a clockwise manner as we go down each row.\n\nNow, moving on to Example 2. The input is similar, with a single 1 in the bottom left again. The output here is a bit more complex. Each row in the output seems to involve moving the 1 one position to the right and then wrapping around. The first row starts with 0, then 1, 0. The next row is 1, 0, 0, and so on. This suggests that the 1 is moving right every row and then looping back to the beginning.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is all zeros except for a 1 at the bottom left. The output starts with 0, 0, 0, 1, then 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, and finally 1, 0, 0, 0. This pattern seems to involve the 1 moving down and to the right in a cyclic manner, but each time wrapping around when it reaches the end.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the rule involves moving the 1 in a cycle that includes all columns and wraps around when it reaches the last column. Each row shifts the 1 one position to the right, and when it goes past column 4, it wraps back to column 1. This process repeats for each row in the grid.\n\nTo confirm this, I can think about how the 1 would move across multiple rows. For example, in Example 1, the 1 starts in the first column and moves to the second column in the first two rows, then back to the first column in the next two rows. This pattern suggests that the 1 is moving in a circle that includes all columns.\n\nIn Example 2, the 1 moves to the right each row, starting from column 1. After moving right three times (since there are four columns), it wraps around to column 1 again. This aligns with the idea that the 1 moves right by one column each row, wrapping around after the last column.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the 1 moves down and to the right each row. After moving down, it wraps around to the next column. This again fits the pattern of cyclic movement.\n\nSo, the rule is to take the 1 from the bottom left and have it move right by one column in each subsequent row. If it reaches the end of the columns (column 4), it wraps around to column 1. This movement continues for each row in the grid.\n\nBased on this, the output grid for the given Input will follow this cyclic right-moving pattern of the 1.

Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Example 1. The input is a 10x2 grid filled with zeros and one 1 in the last row. The output is a 10x2 grid that alternates between 0 and 1 in a specific pattern. \n\nLet me write down the input and output for clarity:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\n\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nHmm, I notice that the output alternates between 0 and 1 in the first column and then 1 and 0 in the second column. Specifically, the first column in the output seems to be following the pattern 0, 1, 0, 1, etc., but starting from 0. The second column is the opposite of the first. So maybe the rule is that each element in the output is the opposite of the element in the input, but with a twist.\n\nLet me check another example. Example 2 has an input that's 9x3 with all zeros and a 1 in the last row. The output is similar, but each element is shifted in a way that the first column is 0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1 and the second column is 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0. Wait, but the third column in the output is always 0. So maybe the third column remains 0, and the first two columns are alternating as in Example 1.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output is:\n\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nSo the third column in the output is 0 in all cases, except when the input has a 1 in the first or second column, but since the input's first two columns are 0 except for the last row, which has 1 in the first column, perhaps the third column is always 0.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the input has 9 rows of 0s and one row with 1 0 0 0, and the output is:\n\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\nSo the third and fourth columns are the opposite of each other, and the first column alternates between 0 and 1, but the second column is the opposite of the first, and the fourth column is the same as the second. \n\nThis suggests that the rule is that each element in the output grid is the opposite of the corresponding element in the input grid, but in a specific pattern where the first and second columns are swapped in a way that alternates. Wait, no, that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output is the input with the first and second columns swapped, but that doesn't fit because in Example 1, the output's first column is 0,1,0,1, etc., which would be the opposite of the input's second column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the output is the inverse of the input, where 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0, but only in certain positions.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a 1 in the last row, and the output has a 1 in the first column and 0 in the second. So if the rule is that the output is the inverse of the input, but only for the last row, that might fit. But let's check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input's last row has 1 0 0. The output has 1 0 0. Wait, that's the same, so the rule isn't just the inverse. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the output is the inverse of the input, except for the last row, which remains the same.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output's last row is 0 1 0 0, which is the inverse of 1 0 0 0. So perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the inverse of the corresponding element in the input, except for the last row, which remains the same.\n\nWait, let me test that hypothesis. In Example 1, the input's last row is 1 0. The output's last row is 1 0, which is the same as the input. So the rule holds. In Example 2, the input's last row is 1 0 0, and the output's last row is 1 0 0, which is the same. In Example 3, the input's last row is 1 0 0 0, and the output's last row is 0 1 0 0, which is the inverse. So that seems consistent.\n\nSo the rule is: for all rows except the last one, the output is the inverse of the input. For the last row, the output is the same as the input.\n\nLet me check this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the last row is 1 0. The inverse would be 0 1, but the output is 1 0, which is the same as the input. So yes, the rule holds.\n\nIn Example 2, the last row is 1 0 0. The inverse would be 0 1 0, but the output is 1 0 0, which is the same as the input. So the rule holds.\n\nIn Example 3, the last row is 1 0 0 0. The inverse would be 0 1 0 1, but the output is 0 1 0 0, which is not the inverse. Wait, that's a problem. So my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me look at Example 3 again. The input's last row is 1 0 0 0, and the output is 0 1 0 0. So the first and fourth columns are swapped, but the others remain. Hmm, so maybe the rule is that each pair of columns is swapped, but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that in the output, the first column is the inverse of the second column, the second column is the inverse of the third, etc. But in Example 1, the output alternates between 0 and 1 in the first column and then 1 and 0 in the second, which fits that pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output's first column is 0 1 0 1 etc., which is the inverse of the input's second column (which is always 0, except the last row which is 0, so 0 becomes 1), and the second column is the inverse of the first column (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0). So perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the inverse of the input, but in a way that the first and second columns are swapped.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the output grid is the inverse of the input grid, but only for the last row, which remains the same. But in Example 3, the last row's output is 0 1 0 0, which is not the inverse of 1 0 0 0, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output grid is the inverse of the input grid, except for the last row, which is the same. But in Example 3, the last row's output is not the inverse, so that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the output grid is the inverse of the input grid, but the last row is the same as the input. Let me test that with Example 1. The input's last row is 1 0, the inverse would be 0 1, but the output is 1 0, which is the same as the input. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that the output grid is the inverse of the input grid, but only for the first row, which is the same as the input. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row is 0 0. The inverse of that would be 1 1, but the output is 0 1, which is not the inverse. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the output grid is the inverse of the input grid, but the last column is inverted as well. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1, the last row is 1 0. The inverse would be 0 1, but the output is 1 0, which is the same as the input's first column. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output grid is the inverse of the input grid, except that the first element of the last row is 0 and the rest are 1, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the output grid is the inverse of the input grid, but only the last row is changed. Let me think.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output's last row is 1 0, which is the same as the input. The inverse of the input's last row would be 0 1. So the output is same as the input's first row, which is 0 0, and the rest are 1 0.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me create a table for each example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0\n...\nRow 9: 1 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 1\nRow 1: 1 0\n...\nRow 9: 1 0\n\nSo for all rows except the last, the output is inverse of input. For the last row, it's same as input.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0\n...\nRow 8: 1 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 1 0\nRow 1: 1 0 0\n...\nRow 8: 1 0 0\n\nAgain, all rows except the last are inverse, last row same.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0\n...\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 1 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0\n...\nRow 8: 0 1 0 0\nRow 9: 0 1 0 0\n\nWait, in this case, the last row's output is 0 1 0 0, which is the inverse of 1 0 0 0. So the rule applies differently.\n\nSo in Example 3, the last row's output is the inverse of the input for that row, but in other rows, it's the inverse.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the last row's output is same as input. So the rule is that for the last row, the output is same as input, and for all other rows, the output is inverse of input.\n\nWait, let's test that with Example 2. The last row's output is same as input, which is 1 0 0. The inverse of 1 0 0 would be 0 1 0, which is not the output, so the rule can't be that all rows except last are inverse, last is same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output is the inverse of the input, but for the last row, the inverse is applied and then some transformation.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the output's last row is 0 1 0 0, which is the inverse of 1 0 0 0. But the inverse of 0 0 0 0 0 is 1 1 1 1 0, which is not the output.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe the rule is that the output is the inverse of the input, but only for the first few rows and then some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output is the inverse of the input, but the first column is the inverse of the second column, and the second is the inverse of the third, etc.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's first column is 0,1,0,1,... which is the inverse of the second column (which is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). So the first column is the inverse of the second, and the second is inverse of the third, etc.\n\nIn Example 2, the output's first column is 0,1,0,1,... which is the inverse of the second column (1,0,1,0,...). Similarly, the second column is inverse of the third.\n\nIn Example 3, the output's first column is 0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0. Wait, that doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output is a 90-degree rotation of the input. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 10 rows, output is 10 rows. If it's rotated 90 degrees, the first column would be the last row, but the input's last row is 1 0, which would become 0 1, but the output's first column is 0 1, which matches. The second column would be the last column of the input, which is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second column is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but in Example 1, the output's second column is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which matches. So the rule is that the output is a 90-degree rotation of the input. Wait, but in Example 3, the last row's output is 0 1 0 0, which would be a 90-degree rotation of 1 0 0 0, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the output is a 90-degree rotation of the input.\n\nSo the rule is that the output grid is the input grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nTherefore, to find the output grid, we need to rotate each row of the input grid 90 degrees clockwise and arrange them as columns.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the output is a 10x10 grid, same as the input. So each row in the input becomes a column in the output.\n\nSo for example, input row 0 is 0 0, which becomes output column 0 as 0 0.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rotation.\n\nWait, let me think about rotating a row. If the input is a row of 10 elements, rotating 90 degrees clockwise would place the first element as the last element of the first row, the second as the last of the second row, etc., but that's not matching the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rotation is such that each row becomes a column in reverse order. So for example, input row 0 is [0,0], which becomes [0,0] as the first two columns in the output.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output's first column is 0,1,0,1,... which is the same as the input's last row.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me approach it differently.\n\nIf the output is a 90-degree rotation of the input grid, then each row becomes a column in reverse order. So for example, the input row 0 is [0,0], which would become [0,0] as the first two columns in the output. But in Example 1, the first column of the output is 0,1,0,1,... which is the last row of the input.\n\nHmm, maybe the rotation is applied to each row individually, and each row becomes a column in reverse.\n\nWait, let me take Example 1 again. The input's last row is 1 0. If we rotate this row 90 degrees clockwise, it remains 1 0. But in the output, the last row is 1 0, same as input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rotation is applied to the entire grid, but that doesn't make sense because the output has the same number of rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output is the input grid rotated 90 degrees, but each row is reversed. So for example, the first row becomes the last column in reverse order.\n\nWait, let me try that with Example 1. The input's last row is 1 0. If we reverse it, it becomes 0 1. But the output's last row is 1 0, which doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output grid is the input grid with each row reversed. So input row 0 becomes output column 0 reversed, input row 1 becomes output column 1 reversed, etc.\n\nLet me test that with Example 1. The last row is 1 0. Reversed becomes 0 1. But the output's last row is 1 0, which doesn't match. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output grid is the input grid rotated 90 degrees, but the rows are reversed. So input row 0 becomes output column 0 reversed, input row 1 becomes output column 1 reversed, etc.\n\nWait, in Example 1, if we rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise, the first row [0,0] becomes the last column of the output. Rotating 90 degrees again would make it the last row.

Let's look at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\n\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nI notice that the input grid has 10 rows of 0s and one row of 1 and 0. The output grid alternates between 0 and 1, but the 1s are placed in specific positions. For example, the first output is 0 1, which seems to be placing a 1 in the second column of the first input row (0 0). Then 1 0 in the second row, which is 0 0 again but swapping. This pattern repeats for each row except the last one, which is another 0 1 and 1 0.\n\nSo, it looks like the rule is taking the position of the 1 in each input row and placing it in the corresponding output row. The 1s in the input row are at the second column, so in the output, each row has a 1 in the second position. The 0s become 1s in the output, but only in the positions where the input had 1s.\n\nMoving to Example 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nHere, the pattern is similar. The 1 in the input row is at the first position, so in the output, each row has a 1 in the first column. The other positions remain 0s, but since the input had 0s, they become 1s in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 3 to confirm:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\nAgain, the 1 in the input is at the fourth position, so in the output, it's placed in the fourth column of each row. The 0s become 1s in the output for the column where the input had 1s.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule seems to be: identify the position of the 1 in each input row. Then, in the corresponding output row, place a 1 in the same position. The rest of the positions are 0s. For rows that don't have a 1, we fill them with 1s in a way that aligns with the position of the 1 in the previous row.\n\nWait, no, looking back, in Example 1, after the first row (0 1), the next rows have 1 0, which suggests that the 1s are placed in the second column of each row. In Example 2, the 1s are in the first column. So it's not about previous rows but the position within each row.\n\nSo the rule is: for each input row, find the column index where the 1 is located. Then, in the corresponding output row, set that column to 1. All other columns remain 0. For rows without a 1, they are filled with 1s in a way that each column is set to 1 for every other row, except the ones that have a 1 in the same column. Wait, no, in Example 1, the output rows are 0 1, 1 0, 0 1, etc., which suggests that each time a row has a 1, the next row swaps it. So perhaps the rule is that for each input row, if there's a 1, the next row will have the 1 in the next column, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. The rule is to shift the 1s in a circular manner. For each row, if there's a 1, the next row will have the 1 in the next column, and the one after that will have it in the column after the next, and it loops back to the beginning if necessary.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, shift the 1s one column to the right. For example, in Example 1, the 1 in the first row moves to the second column in the second row, which then moves to the first column in the third row, and so on. This would explain why the output rows alternate between 0 1 and 1 0.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the 1 in the first row moves to the first column in the second row, which then moves to the second column in the third row, and so on. This would explain why the output rows have 1s in the first column.\n\nIn Example 3, the 1 in the first row moves to the fourth column in the second row, which then moves to the third column in the third row, and so on. The output rows have 1s in the fourth column.\n\nSo the rule is: for each row, if there's a 1, the 1 shifts one column to the right in the next row, and if it wraps around, it continues from the beginning.\n\nFor rows without a 1, the output row consists of all 0s except for the circular shift when a 1 was present in the previous row.\n\nWait, no. Looking at Example 1, all the output rows have exactly one 1, which is the 1 from the corresponding input row shifted to the next column. So if an input row has a 1 in column i, the output row will have a 1 in column (i+1) mod 10. For example, if i=0, the next column is 1; if i=9, the next column is 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 1 is in column 1 (assuming columns are 0-based?), but in the output, it's in column 2, which is the next column. Wait, perhaps the columns are 1-based. Let me check the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the first input row is 0 0, so no 1s. The output row is 0 1, which suggests that the 1 is in column 2 if columns are 1-based. Then in the next row, it's 1 0, which would mean the 1 is in column 1 of that row. So perhaps the columns are 1-based.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 0-based. Let me think.\n\nIf the columns are 0-based, then the first column is 0, the second is 1, etc. So in Example 1, the 1 is in column 1. Then in the output row, it's in column 2, which would be the next column. So for each row, the 1 is shifted to the next column, wrapping around from column 9 back to column 0.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\nFor each input row, if there is a 1, then in the corresponding output row, the 1 is shifted to the next column (c+1 mod 10). All other columns are 0. Additionally, for rows without a 1, the output row is all 0s. However, looking at Example 1, the output rows have exactly one 1, and the rest 0s. Similarly, in Example 2, each output row has one 1, and in Example 3, each output row has one 1.\n\nWait, but in the input grids, the last row has a 1 followed by 0s. The output also has a 1 in the corresponding position. So the rule seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: For each input row, if there is a 1, then in the output row, that 1 is moved to the next column (c+1) in a circular manner (wrapping around from column 9 back to 0). If there is no 1, then the output row is all 0s.\n\nSo to apply this rule, I need to process each row of the input grid. For each row, check if there is a 1. If there is, shift the 1 to the next column, wrapping around. If there is no 1, set all columns to 0.\n\nLet me apply this to the test input grid provided:\n\nTest Input Grid:\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n\nFor each row:\n\n1. First row: all 0s. Output: 0 0 0 0 0\n2. Second row: all 0s. Output: 0 0 0 0 0\n3. Third row: all 0s. Output: 0 0 0 0 0\n4. Fourth row: all 0s. Output: 0 0 0 0 0\n5. Fifth row: all 0s. Output: 0 0 0 0 0\n6. Sixth row: all 0s. Output: 0 0 0 0 0\n7. Seventh row: all 0s. Output: 0 0 0 0 0\n8. Eighth row: all 0s. Output: 0 0 0 0 0\n9. Ninth row: all 0s. Output: 0 0 0 0 0\n10. Tenth row: 1 0 0 0 0. Since there's a 1, in the output row, the 1 will be shifted to column 1 (next column). So the output row becomes 0 1 0 0 0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 1 is in column 0 (assuming 0-based). Shifting to next column would be column 1. So output is 0 1 0 0 0.\n\nSo the final output grid is:\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\nOutput:\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1\n1 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully examining the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid is a 10x2 matrix filled with 0s except for the last row which has a 1. The output grid is a 10x2 matrix where the 1s are positioned in a specific pattern. The output seems to be a checkerboard pattern, alternating between 0 and 1. The first row has 0 and 1, then 1 and 0, and so on. This suggests that the 1s are placed in an alternating diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-left corner.\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid is a 10x3 matrix filled with 0s except for the last row which has 0, 0, 0 but one 1. The output grid shows 0s except for specific positions where 1s are placed. It appears that the 1s are placed in the same alternating diagonal pattern as Example 1 but extended to three columns. This would mean that the 1s are now placed in columns 1 and 3, creating a sort of diagonal zigzag pattern across the grid.\n\nMoving on to Example 3, the input is a 10x4 grid filled with 0s except for the last row which has 1, 0, 0, 0. The output grid follows a similar pattern, placing 1s in the first column and then the third column, creating another diagonal pattern. This shows that the 1s are moving across the grid in a diagonal manner, skipping the second and fourth columns.\n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be that the 1s in the output grid are placed along diagonals that start from the bottom-left corner and move upward to the right. Specifically, each diagonal is shifted one column to the right each time, creating a pattern that alternates between placing 1s in the first and third columns. Additionally, there's an extra 1 in the last column of the first diagonal.\n\nThis pattern continues for each row, resulting in a grid where the 1s form a diagonal zigzag, alternating between two columns as we move up each row. This explains why in each subsequent row, the 1s shift but stay within the same diagonal pattern.\n\nTo apply this rule to the test input grid, which is a 10x5 grid with a single 1 in the last row of the fifth column, the output grid should follow the same diagonal pattern. The 1s would be placed in the first column and the fifth column, creating a diagonal that spans the entire grid from the bottom-left to the top-right.\n\nSo, the final output grid should have 1s in the first and fifth columns, arranged diagonally across the grid, starting from the bottom-left and moving up to the right. Each diagonal is one column apart from the previous one, maintaining the alternating pattern observed in the examples.\n</think>", 0.0]]}
