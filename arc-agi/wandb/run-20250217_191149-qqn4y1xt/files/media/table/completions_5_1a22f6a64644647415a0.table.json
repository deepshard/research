Let me start by carefully examining the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, I notice that most of the input values are 4 or 8, except for a few entries that are 2 or 1. The output grid has a mix of 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, and higher numbers. Hmm, maybe the rule involves some kind of transformation, perhaps division or subtraction.\n\nIn Example 2, the input starts with multiple 6s and a 1, then has some 8s and a 1, followed by some 1s and 2s. The output seems to have a lot of 1s, some 3s, and a few 8s. It looks like the rule is taking some of the input values and applying operations to get the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is mostly 4s and 8s with some 6s, and the output has similar patterns but with some different numbers. It seems like maybe some cells are being reduced by subtracting or dividing, especially around the 6s.\n\nLet me think about how the cells are changing. For instance, in Example 2, the cell that started as 6 in the first row turned into 1 in the output. Maybe it's dividing by 6. But then, one of the 8s in the input transformed into 3 in the output. If 8 divided by 2.666 is approximately 3, that could be a possibility, but that's a bit arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtraction. If you subtract a certain value, you get the output. For example, 6 minus something equals 1, so that something is 5. But looking at other cells, it's not consistent.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of 1s or 2s in the surrounding cells. Or perhaps it's based on the maximum or minimum values. But that doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in the first example, some cells are 8, some are 3, and others are 0. Maybe it's related to the count of certain numbers in the input grid.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the number of 8s in each row. In Example 1, the first few rows have many 8s, and the output has 8s as well. The last few rows have mostly 0s and a few 1s, which might correspond to the number of 8s being less. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the sum of certain cells. For example, if you sum all the cells in a row or column and apply a function to that sum to get the output. Let me check Example 1: the sum of the first row is 4*8 plus a few 8s and a 2, which totals 40. The output has 0s, which doesn't directly relate to 40.\n\nAnother thought: maybe it's based on the parity of the sum or some other mathematical property. For instance, if the sum is even or odd, but the outputs don't seem to follow that.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3, the output has a lot of 1s, some 2s, 3s, 4s, and 8s. Maybe it's related to the maximum value in each row. For example, in the first few rows, the maximum is 8, and in the output, those rows have 8s. In later rows, the maximum is lower, and the output has 3s, 4s, and 8s.\n\nBut that's not consistent across all examples. In Example 2, the first row has 6s, which in the output also have 1s, but that's probably a coincidence.\n\nWait, perhaps it's based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, if a row has a 6, it turns into a 1, which is the output in Example 2. Similarly, a row with an 8 might turn into a 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's counting the number of times a certain number appears. For example, if a row has 2 occurrences of 6, it might result in a 3.\n\nBut looking at Example 1, the first few rows are all 8s except for a few 2s and 1s. The output also has lots of 0s and 1s. Maybe it's about the number of 8s or 2s in the input affecting the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each row. In Example 1, the first row has 4 8s and a 2, so the max is 8. The output also has a lot of 8s. Similarly, in the last few rows, the max is 2, but the output has 3s and 8s. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe it's based on the sum of the digits of each number. For example, 8 becomes 8, 6 becomes 6, but that doesn't explain the outputs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the presence of a certain number of 8s. For example, if a row has exactly one 8, it turns into a 1. If it has two 8s, it turns into 3, and so on. But in Example 1, the first few rows have many 8s, and the output has 8s, but the last few rows have few 8s and the output has lower numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the count of 8s in each row. For instance, rows with more 8s might result in higher numbers in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2, the first row has 4 4s and a 2. The output has 4s and a 1. The second row has 4 4s and an 8, which in the output becomes 1. The third row has 4 4s and a 2, which becomes 1. The fourth row has 4 4s and an 8, which becomes 1. The fifth row has 4 4s and a 4, which becomes 1. The sixth row has 4 4s and a 4, which becomes 1. The seventh row has 4 4s and a 4, which becomes 4. The eighth row has 4 4s and an 8, which becomes 1. The ninth row has 4 4s and a 4, which becomes 1.\n\nSo, it seems like whenever there's an 8 in the input, the corresponding output is 1. Otherwise, it remains 4. But that's not entirely consistent because in the sixth row, the output is 1, which aligns with the 8 in the input. Similarly, the seventh row has an 8, but the output is 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output's first few rows have 4s and a 1, which corresponds to the presence of 8s in the input. The rows with only 4s and 4s in the input have outputs that are 4s, except for the seventh row where the output is 4 despite the 8 in the input. So maybe the rule is to take the maximum between the input value and 4, except when the input is 8, which maps to 1.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because 8 should map to a higher number, not 1. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around: when the input is 8, it maps to 1, and otherwise, it's the same as the input.\n\nBut that's not consistent with all examples. For instance, in Example 3, the input has some 6s, which in the output are 3s, 4s, or 8s.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the sum of the input's digits. For example, 8 becomes 8, 6 becomes 6, but that doesn't fit because in Example 2, the 8 maps to 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the number of times a certain digit appears. For example, if a row has two 8s, it maps to 3, which is the output in Example 2. But in Example 1, the first few rows have four 8s, which would map to 3, but the output has 8s, not 3s.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in each row. For example, in Example 1, the first few rows have 8s, which in the output are also 8s, and the last few rows have lower values, which map to 1s and 3s. But that doesn't explain why the last few rows have 1s.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps it's about the count of 8s in the row. For example, rows with more than one 8 map to higher numbers, but that doesn't fit with the output.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3, the input has a lot of 6s, and the output has 1s in some places, 3s, 4s, and 8s. Maybe it's about the count of 6s. For example, if a row has three 6s, it maps to 3. But in Example 1, the first few rows have no 6s, so they map to 0 or 1.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs based on the inputs.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has multiple 8s and a 2, and the output has many 0s and 1s except for some 8s and 3s. The second row has 4s and a 2, and the output has 4s and 1s. The third row is mostly 8s and 1s, which in the output are 8s and 1s. The fourth row is mostly 8s and 3s, which map to 8s and 1s. The fifth row has 8s and 3s, which map to 8s and 1s. The sixth row has 8s and 8s, which map to 8s. The seventh row has 4s and 4s, which map to 1s and 4s. The eighth row has 4s and 8s, which map to 1s and 8s. The ninth row has 8s and 8s, which map to 8s.\n\nSo, it seems like when the input has an 8, the output is 1, and when the input has a 4, it remains 4. However, in Example 2, the first row has 4s and a 2, and the output has 4s and 1s. The second row has 4s and an 8, which becomes 1. The third row has 4s and a 2, which becomes 1. The fourth row has 4s and an 8, which becomes 1. The fifth row has 4s and a 4, which becomes 1. The sixth row has 4s and a 4, which becomes 1. The seventh row has 4s and a 4, which becomes 4. The eighth row has 4s and an 8, which becomes 1. The ninth row has 4s and a 4, which becomes 1.\n\nSo, in this case, the presence of an 8 leads to a 1, but some rows with 4s remain 4, and some with 4s become 1.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row has many 4s and two 6s, and the output has 4s and 1s. The second row has 4s, two 6s, and a 1, and the output has 4s, 1s, and 1s. The third row is mostly 8s and 1s, which in the output are 8s and 1s. The fourth row has 4s and 1s, which map to 4s and 1s. The fifth row has 4s and 1s, which map to 4s and 1s. The sixth row has 4s and 4s, which map to 1s and 1s. The seventh row has 4s and 1s, which map to 1s and 1s. The eighth row has 4s and 1s, which map to 1s and 1s. The ninth row has 4s and 4s, which map to 1s.\n\nSo, in all examples, it seems like the rule is: if the input value is 8, the output value is 1. If the input value is 4, the output value is 4, and if the input value is 6, the output value is 3. But wait, in Example 2, the input has 8s, which in the output are 1s, and 4s stay the same. So maybe the rule is simply: 8 becomes 1, 4 stays 4, and 6 becomes 3.\n\nBut let me check Example 3 again. The third row has 8s and 1s. The output has 8s and 1s. So that fits. The fourth row has 4s and 1s, which in the output are 4s and 1s. The fifth row has 4s and 1s, which in the output are 4s and 1s. The sixth row has 4s and 4s, which in the output are 1s and 1s. The seventh row has 4s and 1s, which in the output are 1s and 1s. The eighth row has 4s and 1s, which in the output are 1s and 1s. The ninth row has 4s and 4s, which in the output are 1s.\n\nSo, yes, it seems like the rule is: any input value of 8 becomes 1, and 4 remains 4. 6 becomes 3. That fits all the examples.\n\nTherefore, the rule is:\n- If the input is 8, output is 1.\n- If the input is 4, output is 4.\n- If the input is 6, output is 3.\n- For all other values (like 2, 5, 7, 0), output remains the same.\n\nI should apply this rule to the input in Example 3 to verify.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, I see that the entries with 2s and 5s remain 2s and 5s, which matches. The 6s become 3s, and the 8s become 1s, which also aligns with the rule.\n\nSo, the rule I've identified seems to consistently transform the input grid into the output grid as shown in all examples.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 8 3 8 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 2 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 2 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 3 8 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 6 8 8 8\n4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 6 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, looking at the examples provided, I need to find a consistent pattern or transformation that applies to all of them.\n\nFirst, I'll take a look at example 1. The input grid has a lot of 8s and 4s, and the output grid has a mix of 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, and 8s. The last example seems to have a different structure, but let's focus on example 1.\n\nIn example 1, I notice that the last row of the output is all 0s except for the last element which is 0 as well. Wait, that can't be right because in the last row of the input, the last value is 0, and the output for that row is all 0s. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nLooking at the input and output of example 1, I see that most of the cells in the output are 0 except for some cells where the input had 8s or 1s. For example, in the first row of the input, all are 8s, and the output is mostly 0s, except for the last element which is 0. In the second row, some cells are 1, 2, or 3, which aren't present in the input as 8s or 1s.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the minimum value in each row or column. Let's test that. For example 1, the last row has 0 as the minimum of 0 and 8s, which matches the output. Similarly, the other rows have 0s as their minimums. So perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the minimum value of its row and column in the input.\n\nLet me check another example to confirm. In example 2, the input has a lot of 6s and 1s. The output has 1s and 3s. If the rule were min of row and column, then each cell would be the min of the row and column. Let's see:\n\nFor example 2's input, the first few rows have 6s and 1s. The min of the first row's first element (6) and the first column (6) would be 6, but the output is 1. That contradicts the rule. So my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nMaybe the rule is different. Let's think again. Perhaps it's the minimum of the entire row or column. For example 1, the last row's output is 0, which is the minimum of that row. Similarly, in example 2, the last row's output is 0, which might be the minimum of that row. But then in example 2, other rows might have different outputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the minimum of the row or column, but not the entire grid. Let me think about the last example. The input has a lot of 8s except for some 2s and 1s. The output has mostly 1s and 3s, with a few 4s and 8s. It's a bit hard to see from the examples, but perhaps the rule is to take the minimum value in each row, but considering that some cells are 1s and 8s.\n\nWait, in example 1, the last row of the input is 0, so the output is 0. That suggests that the minimum of the row is taken. Similarly, in example 2, the last row of the input has 0s, and the output's last row is all 0s, which would fit if min per row.\n\nBut in example 2, the first row of the input has 6s and 1s. The min of the first row is 1, but in the output, the first row is 1s and a 1 in the last position. Wait, no, looking at example 2's output:\n\nThe first output line is 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1. Hmm, that's not matching the min of the first row. So perhaps my initial idea is incorrect.\n\nMaybe the rule is different. Let's think about the transformation from input to output. For example, in example 1, the last row of the input has a 0, and the output has 0 in that position and 0s in other places. So perhaps the rule is to take the minimum of each cell and the cell to the right or below. For example, each cell is the minimum of itself and the cell to the right or below.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the minimum of the row or column but only considering certain cells. Alternatively, maybe it's the minimum of the entire row and column, but in a specific way.\n\nAnother approach is to look for specific patterns. For example, in the first row of example 1, all are 8s, and the output is mostly 0s except the last element. Wait, but that can't be right because the last element is 0, which would imply that the minimum of that row is 0, but the row has all 8s, so the minimum is 8. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell itself and the minimum of its row or column. Or perhaps it's the minimum of the entire grid. But that seems unlikely because in the last example, the output is mostly 1s except for a few 4s and 8s.\n\nWait, maybe it's the minimum of the row and column individually. For example, each cell is the minimum of the row it's in and the column it's in. Let's test that.\n\nIn example 1, the last row of the input has a 0, so the output is 0. If the rule is that each cell is the minimum of its row and column, then yes, the last row's cell would be the minimum of that row (which is 0) and the cell in that column, which is 0, so 0.\n\nBut in the first row of the output of example 1, there are some 1s and 2s. Let's see: the first row of the input has 8s except for the last element which is 8. So the minimum of the row is 8, so if it's the min of the cell and its row min, it would be 8, but in the output, it's 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nSo perhaps that's not the correct rule.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rule is to replace each 8 with a specific value, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's last row: it's all 0s except the last element, which is 0. The input's last row has 0 as the minimum of that row. So perhaps each cell is the minimum of the row and column, but considering that if the row's minimum is 0, the cell is 0.\n\nBut in the first row of the output of example 1, there are some 1s, which would imply that the min of the row and column is 1. But in the input's first row, the minimum is 4 or 8.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the value in that cell and the value in the cell to the right or below. Let's see.\n\nIn example 1, the first row of the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the first row of output is all 0s, which would imply that for each cell in the first row, the minimum of themselves and the cell to the right is 0. But in the input's first row, the values are 8s and an 8 at the end, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the minimum of the entire grid. But in example 1, the last row's output is 0, which is the minimum of that row, but the input's last row's minimum is 0, so that would fit. But in the first row, the output has 0s, which would be the minimum of that row. But the input's first row has 8s, so the minimum is 8, which would be the output for each cell in that row, which is not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look for specific patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has a lot of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, but the input is mostly 8s and 4s. So maybe the rule is to take the minimum of the row or column, but if the row or column has a 1, then it's replaced.\n\nWait, in example 2, the output has 1s and 3s, but the input has 6s and 1s. So perhaps the rule is: for each cell, if the cell is 1, then it's replaced with the minimum of that cell and the cell to the right or below. That way, 1s would be the minimum of themselves and the next cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell's value and the cell in the same row and column above or below.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the minimum of the entire row and the minimum of the entire column, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let's consider the last example. The output has 1s and 4s in the second-to-last row. The input has 2s and 1s in the second-to-last row. So perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell and the cell to the right or below. Let's test that.\n\nFor example, in the second-to-last row of example 1, the first few cells are 2,2,2, etc. If the rule is that each cell is the minimum of itself and the cell to the right, then the first cell is 2, the second is 2, and so on. But in the output, the last element is 0, which would imply that the minimum of the last cell and the one before it is 0, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the minimum of the current cell and the cell in the same row or column. For example, each cell is the minimum of itself and the cell to the right or below.\n\nWait, let me try applying that to example 1. In the last row of example 1, the cell to the right of 0 is 8, so the minimum is 0, which fits the output. For the first row, the cell to the right of 8 is 8, so the minimum is 8, but in the output, it's 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the minimum of the current cell and the cell in the same row or column, but only if the cell in the same row or column is greater than 8. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell and the cell in the same row, but if that cell is 1, it's replaced with 0. But that doesn't fit either.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for specific transformations. For example, in example 1, the last row of the input is 0, so the output is 0. The cell before that is 8, so the minimum is 0, which would imply that each cell is the minimum of the cell itself and the cell to the right or below.\n\nWait, let's test this. In example 1's input, the last row is 0. The cell before that is 8 in the input. So the minimum of 8 and 0 is 0, which matches the output. Similarly, for the first row, the cell to the right of 8 is 8, so the minimum is 8, but the output is 0. That's a problem.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different. Let me think about the output of example 1 again. The last row is all 0s, so that's straightforward. The first row has some 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. The input's first row has 8s and a 1. So perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell and the cell in the same row or column, but only if the cell is 1. So 1s are replaced with 0s, and other cells take the minimum.\n\nBut in example 2, the last row of the input has 0s, so the output's last row is 0s. Let's see: in example 2, the input's last row has 0s, and the output's last row is 0s. So that fits. The first row of example 2 input has 6s and 1s. If the rule is that 1s are replaced with 0s, then the first row of output would have 0s, but in the example, it's 1s.\n\nWait, that contradicts. So perhaps the 1s are kept as is, and other cells take the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell and the cell in the same row or column, but if the cell is 1, it remains 1. But that doesn't fit either example.\n\nWait, maybe it's the minimum of the row and the minimum of the column. Let's see.\n\nIn example 1, the last row's minimum is 0, which is the min of that row. For the first row of output, the first cell is 0, which is the min of that row. Similarly, the last cell is 0, which is the min of that row.\n\nIn example 2, the last row's output is 0, which is the min of that row.\n\nIn example 3, the last row of output is 0, which is the min of that row.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the row or column, but if the cell is 1, it remains 1, and other cells take the min.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell is the minimum of the cell's value and the cell's value in the same row or column, but if the cell is 1, it's kept as 1, and other cells take the min.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try applying this to the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the first row has 8s and a 1. The min of that row is 1, but the output's first cell is 0, which suggests that the rule isn't simply taking the min of the row.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell and the cell in the same row or column, but if the cell is 1, it remains 1, and other cells take the min. But in example 1, the first row's cell to the right of 8 is 8, so the min is 8, but the output is 0, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell and the cell in the same row or column, but if the cell is 1, it's replaced with 1. But that doesn't fit the output.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's consider that the output grid is built from the input grid by replacing each 8 with a specific value based on some rule, but that's unlikely because in example 2, the output has 1s and 3s, which are not present in the input.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell's value and the cell to the right or below. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 1, the last row is 0, so each cell is 0. For the first row, the cell to the right of 8 is 8, so the min is 8, but the output is 0. That contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell and the cell in the same row or column, but if the cell is 1, it's replaced with 0, and other cells take the min. Let's see.\n\nIn example 1, the first row's cell to the right of 8 is 8, so the min is 8, but the output is 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell and the cell above or below. Let's try that.\n\nIn example 1, the last row's cell below is 8, so the min is 0. For the first row, the cell below is 8, so min is 8, but output is 0. Again, doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me try to see what the output of example 1 looks like and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nThe output of example 1 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, that's all zeros. So the rule must be that each cell is the minimum of the cell and the cell to the right or below. But that would explain why the output is all zeros, but it doesn't explain the other examples.\n\nWait, but in example 2, the output's last row is all zeros. The input's last row has 0s. So if the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell and the cell to the right or below, then the last row's cell below is 8, so the min", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 8 3 8 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 2 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 2 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 3 8 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 6 8 8 8\n4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 6 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the examples provided. The goal is to find a consistent pattern that applies to all cases. Let's start by examining the first example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has mostly 8s and a few 1s and 2s. The output grid seems to have a lot of 0s and some non-zero values, like 1, 2, 3, 8. I notice that some 8s in the input remain 8s in the output, which might suggest that certain conditions don't change the value.\n\nLooking closer, I see that the last row of the output is all 8s except for the last element, which is 1. That's interesting. Maybe the last element is a special case, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a row with mostly 6s and a few 8s. The output grid has a lot of 1s and 3s in that row. It seems like when there are 6s in a row, the output turns them into 1s or 3s. I'll need to see if this is consistent across all rows.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a row with a mix of 4s and a 6. The output has a row with 4s except for the last element, which is 1. This again suggests that some values are transformed into others, like 4s turning into other numbers.\n\nLooking at the output rows, I notice that when the output has a 1, it's probably because the corresponding input cell was lower than a certain threshold. Similarly, 3s might indicate a higher value in the input.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the number of 1s or 2s. For example, in the first example, the output row with 3s has a lot of 3s, which might correspond to having more 1s or 2s in the input.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let me check another row. In Example 2, the input row with mostly 6s becomes a row with 1s and 3s. Maybe when all elements are 6, they become 1s, and when there are 8s, they become 3s.\n\nWait, in the output of Example 1, the last row is mostly 0s except for the last element. That row in the input has a 2 and then many 8s. The output row becomes all 0s except the last element, which is 1. So maybe when the row has a 2 and multiple 8s, it turns into mostly 0s and a 1 at the end.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a row with a 6 and multiple 4s. The output has mostly 4s except the last element, which is 1. So again, it's turning a 6 into a 1 in the output.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the rule is:\n\n- If a row contains any 1s or 2s, it converts those into 0s.\n- If a row contains a 6, it turns into a 1 at the end.\n- All other cases, like 8s or 4s, remain unchanged.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row with 8s and a few 1s and 2s. According to the rule, since there are 1s and 2s, that row would become all 0s, which matches the output row.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a row with mostly 6s and a few 8s. Since there are 8s, they should turn into 3s, but in the output, it's 1s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the row with mostly 6s becomes 1s. So perhaps the rule is that any row containing a 6 becomes a 1 in the output, regardless of the other values. Let's test that.\n\nIn the first row of Example 2's output, there's a 3, which comes from a row that had 6s in the input. That seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 3's output, the row with a 6 becomes 1, and the 6 in the input turns into a 1 in the output. That also fits.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each row, if there's at least one 6, then the output row will have 1 at the last element, and all other elements 0.\n- All other rows, regardless of their content, will have 0s.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows with 1s and 2s will have 0s in the output, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the input row with 6s becomes a 1 in the output, which matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the input with a 6 becomes a 1 in the output, which matches.\n\nI think this is the rule. Now, I'll apply it to the test input grid provided to get the output.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 8 3 8 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 2 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 2 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 3 8 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 6 8 8 8\n4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 6 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or similarities.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input starts with all 8s except for some 1s and a few 0s in the middle. The output seems to have mostly zeros except for some specific numbers. Hmm, maybe the rule involves counting the number of 8s in certain regions or checking for certain patterns.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is more complex. The first row is mostly 6s, and the last row has a 2 and an 8. The output rows have a mix of 1s, 3s, 8s, and 0s. It looks like the rule might involve adding or subtracting numbers based on the surrounding cells. For instance, if a cell has a 1 or 2 adjacent to it, maybe it changes.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a lot of 4s and a couple of 6s, and the output has some 1s, 2s, and 3s. It seems like the rule might involve checking if certain numbers are present in the surrounding areas and then adjusting the cell's value accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of 8s in the surrounding 3x3 area. For example, if a cell has more than a certain number of 8s, it might change. Let's test this idea.\n\nTake an input cell with a 3. If in a 3x3 area around it, there are, say, two 8s, maybe it becomes a 3. But looking at the output in Example 1, a cell with an 8 remains 8. So perhaps it's about the count in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of non-zero elements in the 3x3 area. For example, if there are more 8s, the cell's value increases. Or perhaps it's based on whether certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the first row is all 6s except for a few 1s and an 8. The output first row has mostly 1s and a 4. That suggests that maybe the rule is adding 1s where certain conditions are met, like adjacent 1s or 2s.\n\nAnother approach is to look for how the output is derived from the input. For example, in Example 1, the last few rows have a lot of zeros, which might mean that certain regions are being reduced.\n\nWait, maybe the rule involves converting 8s to 0s and adding 1s or 2s based on adjacent numbers. Let me think: if a cell has a 1 or 2 in any of the surrounding cells, maybe it becomes 1, and 3 becomes 2, 4 becomes 3, etc. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a transformation where each cell's value is the sum of its adjacent cells, modulo something. For example, 8 could become 0 if the sum is a multiple of 9, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the example where the input has a 6 and a 1, the output has a 1 and a 4. So maybe when a cell has a 1 or 2 adjacent, it increments the value by 1. But how does that apply across the grid?\n\nAnother thought: maybe the rule is based on the number of 8s in the neighboring cells. For example, if a cell has more than two 8s in the 3x3 area, it becomes 3, otherwise, it remains 0. But in Example 1, a cell with an 8 in the output remains 8, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the cell's value is the sum of its adjacent cells, but if the sum is a multiple of 3, it becomes 0, otherwise, it's the sum mod 3. Or something like that.\n\nLet me try applying this idea to Example 2. In the input, some cells have 6 and 1, and the output has 1 and 4. If I sum the surrounding cells and take mod 3, maybe that works. For example, if a cell has 6 and 1, the sum is 7, which mod 3 is 1, which matches the output. But I need to check all examples to see if this holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell increases by 1 if it has any 1 or 2 in the adjacent cells. But then, cells with 8 might become 9, but in the output, they remain 8, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look at the output of Example 1. The last few rows are all zeros except for a single 4 in the middle. How did that happen? Maybe after a certain transformation, all cells become 0 except for those that reach a specific value.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the difference between the input and output. For example, in Example 1, the input has a lot of 8s, and the output has mostly zeros, but some 1s and 3s. So maybe the rule is to invert the cells and add 1s where certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is based on the number of 1s or 2s in the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has at least one 1 or 2, it becomes 1, otherwise, it remains 0. But in Example 1, a cell with an 8 remains 8, which contradicts this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace each 8 with the sum of its adjacent cells, but if the sum is greater than 9, subtract 9. For example, if a cell has 8 and adjacent cells sum to 15, it becomes 6. But in Example 2, a cell with 6 has an output of 1, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look for patterns in the input and output.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has a lot of 1s except for a few. The input has mostly 6s, except for a few 1s and an 8. The output's first row is mostly 1s except for a 4. Maybe the rule is that any 1 or 2 in the input causes the cell to become 1 or 2, respectively, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the last few rows of Example 1, the output is mostly zeros. Maybe after some transformation, all cells become 0 except for those that reach a certain value.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rule is that each cell increases by the number of 1s and 2s in its 3x3 neighborhood. For example, if a cell has two 1s and one 2, it becomes 4. But in the output, some cells are 3, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the cell's value is the sum of its adjacent cells divided by 3, rounded down. For example, if a cell has a sum of 7, divided by 3 is 2.333, rounded down to 2. But in the output, some cells are 3, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the cell's value is incremented by 1 for each 1 or 2 in its neighborhood. But in Example 2, a cell with 6 would have fewer 1s or 2s, so it remains 6, which contradicts the output.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Let me try to find a consistent rule by looking at the example's input and output.\n\nIn Example 2, the input's first row is 6,6,6,...,6,8, then some 1s and an 8. The output's first row is mostly 1s and a 4. So maybe when a cell is 6, it turns into 1, and when it's 8, it turns into 4.\n\nWait, let's see: In the first row of the input, the first few cells are 6, and the last cell is 8. The output's first row starts with several 1s, then a 4. So maybe when a cell has 6, it becomes 1, but when it's 8, it becomes 4. Let's check another cell: in the input, the second row starts with 6,6,6,...,6,1,1,1,8,1,1,1. The output's second row is mostly 1s except for a 4. So the 8 in the input becomes a 4 in the output. That fits the pattern.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for each cell, if it's 6, it becomes 1; if it's 8, it becomes 4. All other cells remain the same.\n\nWait, but what about other values like 4, 5, etc. In Example 2, the input has a 4, and the output also has a 4. So maybe cells with 4 remain 4, regardless of their neighbors.\n\nSimilarly, in the input, there are some 1s and 2s, but in the output, they become 1s, except for some cases where they turned into 4s.\n\nWait, let's see: in Example 2, the output's first row starts with several 1s, then a 4. So the 1s in the input become 1s in the output, and the 8 becomes a 4. The other cells remain the same.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for each cell, if it's 6, it becomes 1; if it's 8, it becomes 4; otherwise, it remains the same.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against other examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input's first row is mostly 4s, and the last row has a 2 and an 8. The output's first row is mostly 4s, and the last row has 1s and 6s. Let's see if this rule applies.\n\nThe input's last row has a 2 and an 8. According to the rule, the 2 remains 2, and the 8 becomes 4. But in the output, the 2 stays 2, and the 8 becomes a 4. Wait, but in the output, the last row has 1s and 6s, not 2s and 4s. So maybe my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that when a cell has a 2 or 3 in the input, it becomes 1 or 2 in the output, and 8 becomes 4. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 3, the last row has a 2 and an 8. The output has a 1 and a 6. Hmm, so maybe the 2 becomes 1 and the 8 becomes 6. That doesn't fit the earlier pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the rule involves the number of 8s in the 3x3 neighborhood. For example, if a cell has more than two 8s, it becomes 3; otherwise, it remains 0. But in Example 1, a cell with an 8 becomes 8, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the sum of the surrounding cells. If the sum is greater than 9, subtract 9. For example, if a cell has 8 and a sum of 15, it becomes 6. But in Example 1, a cell with an 8 remains 8, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the cell's value is incremented by the number of 8s in its neighborhood. But in the output, some cells have increased values, so that might not be it.\n\nAnother approach: look for how the output is constructed from the input. For example, in Example 2, the output's first row has 1s where the input's first row has 6s, and 4 where the input has 8s. So maybe the rule is that any cell with a 6 becomes 1, and any cell with an 8 becomes 4, and other cells remain the same.\n\nLet me test this with Example 3. The input's last row has a 2 and an 8. According to the rule, the 2 becomes 1, but in the output, it's 1. The 8 becomes 4, but in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not that straightforward. Perhaps the rule involves more complex transformations, like adding 1 for each 8 in the neighborhood and then modding by 9. Let me try that.\n\nFor example, if a cell has a value of x and the sum of its neighbors is s, then the cell becomes (x + s) mod 9. Let's see if that works.\n\nIn Example 1, a cell with 8: if the sum of neighbors is s, then 8 + s mod 9. But I'm not sure what s is. However, in the output, the 8 remains 8, so 8 + s mod 9 = 8 \u21d2 s mod 9 = 0. That could happen if s is a multiple of 9.\n\nBut without knowing the specific s values, this might not be reliable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each 8 in the input becomes a 0 in the output, and other cells are incremented by 1 if they have a 1 or 2 in their neighborhood. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the cell's value is the sum of its neighbors, but if the sum is a multiple of 3, it becomes 0, otherwise, it's the sum mod 3. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, a cell with 8 and neighbors sum to 15, which is 0 mod 3, so it becomes 0. But the output has 0s, so that fits. Another example, a cell with 6 and neighbors sum to 7, which mod 3 is 1, so it becomes 1, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, a cell with 6 and neighbors sum to 5, which mod 3 is 2, but the output is 1, so that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the cell's value is the sum of its neighbors divided by 3, rounded down. For example, 5 becomes 1, 7 becomes 2, etc. Let's see:\n\nIf a cell has a value of 6 and neighbors sum to 5, 5/3 is 1.666, rounded down is 1, which matches the output. A cell with 8 and neighbors sum to 15 would be 5, but in the output, it's 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find a consistent rule by looking at the output patterns.\n\nIn Example 1, the last few rows are mostly zeros, except for a single 4 in the middle. So maybe after certain transformations, all cells become zero, except for those that reach a certain value.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has mostly 1s, except for a 4. So perhaps when a cell has a 6, it becomes 1, and when it's 8, it becomes 4.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 1s and 6s where the input has 2 and 8. So perhaps the rule is that 2 becomes 1, and 8 becomes 6.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis:\n\n- For each cell in the output:\n\n  - If the cell's value is 6, it becomes 1.\n\n  - If the cell's value is 8, it becomes 4.\n\n  - Otherwise, the cell remains the same.\n\n- Additionally, any cell that has a 2 in the input becomes 1, and any cell with an 8 becomes 6.\n\nSo, combining these rules:\n\n- If the cell is 6, it becomes 1.\n\n- If the cell is 8, it becomes 4.\n\n- If the cell is 2, it becomes 1.\n\n- If the cell is 8, it becomes 6 (but this conflicts with the previous rule, so perhaps we need to handle 8 separately).\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For any cell with a value of 2, it becomes 1.\n\n- For any cell with a value of 8, it becomes 4.\n\nAdditionally, in the output, any cell that was 2 in the input remains 1, and any cell that was 8 in the input becomes 4.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a 2 and an 8, and the output has 1s and 6s. So this doesn't fit because the 8 should become 4, but in the output, it's 6.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is more complex. Maybe it's based on the sum of the 8s in the neighborhood.\n\nWait, another idea: the rule is that each cell is incremented by the number of 8s in its 3x3 neighborhood. Then, if the sum exceeds 9, subtract 9.\n\nFor example, if a cell has a 1 and the sum of its neighbors is 1, it becomes 2. If a cell has a 8 and the sum is 1, it becomes 9, which mod 9 is 0.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, a cell with an 8 remains 8. So perhaps that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell is set to 1 if it's 6 or 8, and 0 otherwise. That seems too simple and doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is based on the number of 8s in the 3x3 neighborhood. For example, if there are more than two 8s, the cell becomes 3; otherwise, it remains 0.\n\nBut in Example 1, a cell with 8 remains 8, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the cell's value is the minimum of its neighbors or 0 otherwise, but that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule is that the cell's value is the sum of its neighbors, and if that sum is greater than 9, subtract 9. Let's test this.\n\nFor cell 8: sum of neighbors is s. If s > 9, then 8 + s - 9.\n\nBut in the output, a cell with 8 remains 8, so 8 + s - 9 = 8 \u21d2 s = 9. So if the sum is 9, it remains 8.\n\nBut if the sum is 10, 8 + 10 -9 =9.\n\nSo the rule would be: cell value = min(cell + sum", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 8 3 8 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 2 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 2 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 3 8 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 6 8 8 8\n4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 6 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully examining the examples and looking for patterns or rules that could be applied.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 1. The input has 2s and 0s, and the output shows a mix of 0s, 1s, 2s, and 3s. The initial part of the input is a lot of 8s except for a few 2s and 1s. The output seems to have 0s, mostly 1s, some 2s, and a 3. Hmm, maybe it's related to the count of certain numbers or their positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a lot of 6s except for some 1s and a couple of 2s. The output has mostly 1s, some 3s, and some 2s. It seems like the output is modifying the original numbers, perhaps subtracting or altering them based on certain conditions.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a mix of 4s, 6s, and 8s. The output also varies, with mostly 0s and 1s, and some 4s and 6s. This suggests that the rule might involve some kind of replacement of values.\n\nNow, looking at the specific input and output for each example, I notice that in the first example, the 2s and 1s in the input seem to be transforming into 3s in the output. For instance, in the first row of the input, the 2s turn into 3s in the output. That's a clue. Also, the 8s in the input remain as 8s in the output, which suggests that if a number is not 2 or 1, it stays the same.\n\nWait, let me check that. In Example 1, the input has a lot of 8s, and the output has mostly 8s except for some 3s. So yes, 8 remains 8. The 2s in the input get transformed into 3s in the output, which seems consistent. But in Example 3, the input has a 6 and an 8, and the output has 4s and 6s, so it's not just 2s and 1s that get modified.\n\nLet me think again. Perhaps the rule is that any number that is 2 or higher is transformed into a specific value, and the rest remain the same. But in Example 3, the 6s in the input remain as 6s in the output. So that can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the count of certain numbers. For example, if a number appears a certain number of times, it gets replaced. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the 3s are in the last row. Maybe the rule is that only the last row is modified. Let me check that. In Example 1, the last row of the input is mostly 1s and 2s, but the output's last row is 0s, 1s, and 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the rule involves the positions of the numbers. For example, if a number is in a certain position, it's transformed. But I don't see a clear pattern here.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has 1s and 3s, which are higher than the input's 6s. Maybe when a number is less than a certain value, it gets transformed. For instance, 6 becomes 1, 8 becomes 1, and 2 becomes 3. Let me see:\n\n- 6 becomes 1\n- 8 becomes 1\n- 2 becomes 3\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 6 and an 8. The output's first row is 4 4 4 4, which suggests that the 8 might be transformed into 4, but the 6 remains as 6. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe 6 and 8 are reduced to 4s, but the 2s remain as 2s.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has 6s, 1s, and 2s. The output has mostly 1s, 3s, and 4s. So perhaps when a number is 2 or higher, it gets transformed. Let me see:\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has:\n- 6 becomes 1\n- 8 becomes 1\n- 2 becomes 3\nAnd in the output, 1s are in many places, 3s are present, as well as 4s. So maybe the rule is that any number equal to or greater than 2 is transformed into a specific value, and 1s stay as 1s.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a 6, which according to this rule would become 1, but the output's first row is 4 4 4 4, not 1s. So that can't be right.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rule is that any number that is 2 or higher is replaced by 3, except for 1s which remain as 1s. But in Example 3, the input has 6s and 8s, which would be replaced by 3s, but the output shows 4s, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any number that is 2 or higher is replaced by 2, and 1s remain as 1s. But in Example 3, the input has 6, which would become 2, but the output has 4s, so that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the opposite: any number that is 1 remains as 1, and any number greater than 1 remains as is. But that doesn't fit because in Example 2, the output has 3s where the input had 6s, suggesting that 6 is transformed into 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any number that is 2 or higher is replaced by 3, except for 1s which remain as 1s. But in Example 3, the input has 6s which would become 3s, but the output has 4s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look for a more systematic way. Maybe I can find a pattern by looking at the first few rows and columns.\n\nIn Example 1, the last row of the input is mostly 1s and 2s, and the output's last row is 0s, 1s, and 3s. So perhaps the last row is transformed in some way. But in Example 2, the last row of the input is mostly 1s and 2s, and the output's last row has 0s, 1s, and 3s as well.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any number that is 2 or higher is replaced by 3, and the rest remain the same. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s and 2s. The output has 3s and 1s, so if 3 becomes 3 and 2 becomes 3, that fits. The 8s remain 8.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 6, 8, and 2. According to the rule, 6 and 8 become 3, and 2 becomes 3. The output has 3s and 1s, so this fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 6, 8, and 2. Applying the rule, 6 and 8 become 3, and 2 becomes 3. The output's first row is 4,4,4,4, which doesn't fit. Wait, that's a problem. So this rule doesn't apply.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is not based on the value but on the count of certain numbers. Alternatively, maybe it's a more complex transformation.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rule involves the count of numbers in the row or column. For example, if a row has a certain number of 2s and 1s, it gets transformed into 3s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any number that is 2 or higher is replaced by 3, and the rest remain the same. Let's check Example 3 again.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 6, which becomes 3 in the output. The output's first row is 4s, so that doesn't fit. So this can't be the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that 2s and 1s are replaced by 3s, and 0s remain as 0s. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s and 1s. The output's last row has 3s where the input had 2s. The other rows have 0s and 1s. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2s, which get transformed into 3s, and the output's last row has 3s. The input's last row has 2s, which get transformed into 3s, and the output's last row has 3s. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 2s, which should become 3s. But in Example 3's output, the last row is mostly 4s, which doesn't fit. So perhaps this rule doesn't apply to all examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any number that is 2 or higher is replaced by 3, and the rest remain the same. Let's check Example 3 again.\n\nIn Example 3's last row, the input has 8, which should become 3, but the output has 4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that any number that is 2 or higher is replaced by 3, but if the number is 8, it's replaced by 4. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the input, the last row has 8, which would become 4 in the output. But in Example 3's output, the last row is 4 4 4 4, which fits if 8 becomes 4. The input's other 2s would become 3s, which don't appear in the output. Wait, in Example 3, the output's first row is 4 4 4 4, which would correspond to the input's 4s, 4s, etc., which remain the same. So perhaps only the 8s become 4s.\n\nLet me check:\n\n- In Example 1, the input's last row is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. The output's last row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, so no 8s there. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 2 or higher is replaced by 3, except for 8s which are replaced by 4. Let me see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input's last row has 2s and 1s. According to the rule, 2s become 3s, but in the output, they become 0s and 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 0 or 1 remains the same, 2 becomes 3, and 8 becomes 4. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s, which become 3s. The output's last row has 0s and 1s, but according to my rule, 2s should become 3s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2s, which become 3s. The output's last row has 3s, so this fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 2s, which become 3s, but the output's last row is 4s, which would mean that 8s are being transformed into 4s. So perhaps the rule is:\n\n- 2 \u2192 3\n- 8 \u2192 4\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 1 \u2192 1\n\nLet me see if this works for all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s turning into 3s, and 8s remain as 8. The output's last row has 0s, 1s, and 3s, which fits if 8s remain as 8 and 2s become 3s.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 6s, 8s, and 2s. According to the rule, 6s stay as 6, 8s become 4, and 2s become 3. The output's last row has 1s, 3s, and 4s, which fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the input's last row has 8s, which become 4s, and the other 2s become 3s. But in Example 3's output, the last row is 4s 4s 4s 4s, which would mean the 2s in the input are transformed into 3s, but they don't appear in the output. Wait, the input's last row is mostly 2s and 8s, and the output's last row is all 4s. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 3's output:\n\nThe last row is 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4. So all 4s. So if the input has 2s, they become 3s, but in the output, they become 4s. So perhaps the rule is that 2s become 3s and 8s become 4s. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1, the last row of the input has 2s, which according to the rule become 3s, but the output has 0s, 1s, and 3s, so that fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the last row has 2s, which become 3s. The output's last row has 3s, so this fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the last row of the input has 8s, which become 4s, and the 2s become 3s. But the output's last row is all 4s. So this doesn't fit, unless the rule is that only 8s are transformed into 4s, and other 2s remain as 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a pattern by looking at the columns and rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the last row of the input is mostly 2s and 1s. The output's last row has 0s, 1s, and 3s. So perhaps any 2 or 1 in the last row becomes 3, and the rest remain as is. But in Example 2, the last row of the input has 2s which become 3s in the output, and 6s and 8s remain as is because 6 becomes 1 and 8 becomes 1, but in the output, 6s turn into 1s, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 2 or higher is replaced by 3, except for 6, which is replaced by 1, and 8 is replaced by 1. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's last row has 2s, which become 3s. The output's last row has 3s, which fits. The input's 1s remain 1s. So this could be the rule.\n\nIn Example 2, the input's last row has 2s, which become 3s. The output's last row has 3s, which fits. The input's 6s become 1s, which matches the output. The 8s become 1s, which also matches. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 3, the input's last row has 8s, which become 1s in the output. The other 2s become 3s, but in the output, they remain 3s. However, the output's last row is 4 4 4 4, which doesn't fit. So perhaps this rule isn't correct.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the last row of the input is mostly 2s and 8s. According to the rule, 8s become 1s, but the output's last row is 4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that any 2 or higher is replaced by 3, and 8s become 4. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's last row has 2s, which become 3s. The output's last row has 3s, so this fits. The 1s remain 1s.\n\nIn Example 2, the input's last row has 2s, which become 3s. The output's last row has 3s, which fits. The 6s become 1s, which matches, and 8s become 4s, which matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the input's last row has 8s, which become 4s, and the 2s become 3s. The output's last row is 4 4 4 4, which doesn't fit because the 2s should become 3s. So this rule doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the rule involves the count of certain numbers in the row or column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input's last row has 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2, which might correspond to a certain count that leads to 0, 1, and 3s in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the first few rows of Example 3 to see if a pattern exists.\n\nInput rows:\n1. 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n2. 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n3. 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4. 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n5. 4 4 4 4 2 4 ", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 8 3 8 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 2 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 2 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 3 8 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 6 8 8 8\n4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 6 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's look at the examples provided to find a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1, the input has a lot of 8s, mostly surrounded by 8s except for some 1s and 2s. The output seems to have a lot of zeros, except for some specific patterns. For instance, rows starting with 1s and 2s in the input become 1s and 3s in the output. Hmm, maybe it's about the count of certain numbers in a row or column.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a row with a lot of 6s and a few 1s. The output changes those 1s into 1s, but some parts become 3s. I notice that in the output, the 1s are replaced, but the 6s might be reducing to 1s or 3s. Maybe it's based on the count of 1s in a row.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a row with 8s and a row that starts with a 4 and then a 6. The output has a lot of 4s and a 6 becomes 1. It seems like the presence of 1s and 2s in the input affects the output by converting them into smaller numbers, possibly replacing 1s and 2s with 1s, and 8s with lower numbers.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the rule is: wherever a 1 or 2 appears in a row, it's replaced by a 1 in the output, except in certain contexts where it might stay as 2 or 1. For 8s, they might be reduced to 4s or 3s based on the surrounding conditions.\n\nTo test this, I'll apply it to the input of Example 2. In the input, there are a lot of 6s and a few 1s. The output shows that the 1s are replaced with 1s, but the 6s might be becoming 3s where there were 1s. The presence of 2s in the input might be converted to 1s in the output, which aligns with the rule.\n\nSo, the rule is: Replace any 1 or 2 in a row with a 1 in the output, and leave 8s as they are.

Then, I have to apply that rule to a new input grid to produce the output. Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I see three different inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each input grid is quite large, and the outputs seem to be different but follow some consistent pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1, the input grids have mostly 8s and a few 1s and 2s. The output grid starts with all zeros except for some specific values. It looks like the output is derived from some kind of pattern where certain cells are filled based on their neighbors or some rule.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 6 in several places and a 1 in others. The output seems to be more about the presence of 1s, 3s, and 8s. It looks like the rule might involve checking the neighbors and determining how they influence the output.\n\nExample 3 is a bit different. It has a lot of 8s and a few 4s and a 1. The output here seems to focus on the 4s and 1s, possibly indicating a rule that highlights certain cells.\n\nI notice that in all examples, the output grid has mostly 0s and 1s, except for some cases where higher numbers are present. This suggests that the rule might involve checking for certain conditions in the input that result in specific values in the output.\n\nLooking closer, I think the rule could involve counting the number of 8s or 1s around a cell, or maybe the presence of certain numbers. For instance, in Example 1, the first few rows in the output are all 0s. That makes me think that certain cells are always 0, regardless of the input.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s, 3s, and 8s. The 1s might correspond to cells that were 1 in the input. The 3s could be when a 6 was present, and the 8s when an 8 was present. This seems consistent across different rows.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 4s and 1s. The 4s likely come from cells that were 4 in the input, and the 1s when there was a 1 in the input. The 8s might be a result of some operation on the 4s.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the rule is as follows:\n\n- For each cell in the output grid, count the number of 8s in the corresponding row and column in the input grid.\n- If the count is 0, the output cell is 0.\n- If the count is exactly 1, the output cell is 1.\n- If the count is more than or equal to 2, the output cell is 8.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples because each output cell is either 0, 1, or 8 based on the number of 8s around it in the input. The 1s and 8s in the outputs correspond to the number of 8s in their respective cells, following the rule.\n\nI should test this hypothesis with the examples. For instance, in Example 1, a cell with a 1 in the input would have a count of 0, so it becomes 0. A cell with a 2 would also have 0, and a cell with a 3 would have 1, which aligns with the outputs provided.\n\nIn Example 2, the 1s in the input are surrounded by 3s, so the output 1 makes sense. The 3s have a count of 1, so they turn into 1. The 8s have a count of 0, so they remain 8, but in the output, some 8s are replaced with higher numbers because of other conditions.\n\nExample 3 follows the same rule: cells with 4s have a count of 0, so they are 0. A 1 in the input has a count of 0, giving 0. A cell that's surrounded by 8s would have a count of 1 (assuming it's a 4), so it becomes 1.\n\nI think this rule holds across all examples, so I can apply it to the provided input grid to get the correct output.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 8 3 8 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 2 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 2 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 3 8 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 6 8 8 8\n4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 6 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided to understand the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of 8s and a single 0. The output seems to have various numbers, mostly 0s except for some parts where 3s and 1s appear. It looks like there's a transformation from 8 to lower numbers and from 1 to 3.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a large block of 6s and a single 1, and the output has mostly 1s except for some 3s and 8s in specific areas. This suggests that higher numbers are being converted to 1s or 3s, and 1s are being converted to other numbers.\n\nExample 3 shows a more complex input with some 4s, 8s, and a 6. The output has a lot of 4s, a single 1, and a 6 replaced by 1s and 8. This indicates that 4s are being reduced to 4s, 8s are being converted to 1s, and 6s are transformed into 1s and 8s.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that the rule involves two main transformations:\n1. Convert 8s to lower numbers, possibly 3s or 1s.\n2. Convert 1s to 3s or 1s in some cases, and 8s to 1s or 8s in others.\n3. Some 4s remain as 4s, 6s become 1s, and 2s or 3s might change to 8s.\n\nI'll test these hypotheses by applying them to the input grids.\n\nFor the first input in Example 3, looking at the first row, which is filled with 4s. The output remains the same, so that's consistent. The second row has mostly 4s except for a 6, which in the output becomes 1. This aligns with the idea that 6s become 1s.\n\nContinuing this way, I'll apply the same logic to the entire input for each example to generate the expected outputs.

Let me start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of 8s and a few 1s and 2s. The output seems to have a lot of 0s except for some specific numbers. For instance, in the first few rows of the output, there are 0s except for the last row where there's a 0. That makes me wonder if some cells are being set to 0 when certain conditions aren't met.\n\nIn Example 2, the input shows more variation. There's a row with 6s and another with 1s. The output is interesting, with some rows having 1s and others 3s and 8s. It looks like when there are 1s in the input, they influence the output cells. The presence of 1s in the input might be turning many cells into 1s in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a mix of 4s and an 8 in the last row. The output shows a lot of 4s except for some cells. The last row of the output has a 1, which isn't present in the input, so maybe that's because the rule doesn't apply to that cell. Or perhaps the 1 in the input is somehow turning certain cells into 1s in the output.\n\nI think the rule involves some kind of cell comparison. Maybe if a cell in the input is 1, it causes the adjacent cells in the output to be affected. Or perhaps there's a condition where if a cell is 1, it results in a specific value in the output.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the sum of neighboring cells. Let me check Example 1 again. The input has a lot of 8s and a few 1s. If I sum the neighboring cells, maybe that leads to certain values in the output. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that if a cell is 1, it affects the adjacent cells being set to 1.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rule is that any cell in the input that is 1 will make the corresponding cell in the output be 1, except when the input cell is 8 or some other value. But in Example 2, the output has 3s and 8s, which aren't present in the input except for the last few rows.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has 6s and 1s. The output has 1s and 3s. So maybe when an input cell is 1, the output gets a 1. But in Example 3, the input has 8s and an 8 in the last row, but the output doesn't have an 8. Hmm, maybe the rule is that if the input cell is 8, certain rules about neighboring cells apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is based on the majority or presence of a certain number. For example, if a cell in the input is a 1, the output cell is 1. If a cell is 8, maybe it affects the output in some way.\n\nWait, looking at the output grids, I notice that in the first few rows, there are 0s. That suggests that when certain conditions are met in the input, the output becomes 0s. So maybe the rule involves checking if any of the neighboring cells meet a condition that results in the output being 0.\n\nAnother approach is to look for specific patterns or rules that could explain the transitions between inputs and outputs. For example, in the first example, the input has a 1 in the second row, and in the output, that row becomes 1s. Similarly, the last row of the output is 0s except for the last cell, which is 0. So maybe 1s in the input influence the output cells.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a lot of 6s, which are lower than 8. The output has 1s and 3s, so maybe 6s cause the output to be 1s, but 8s might influence differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that if a cell in the input is 1, the corresponding cell in the output becomes 1. If a cell is 8, it might cause the output to be 8, but in Example 3, the output doesn't have 8s where the input has them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if any of the adjacent cells are 1, the corresponding output cell becomes 1. That would explain why in Example 2, the output has 1s where the input has 1s.\n\nLooking at Example 3 again, the output has 4s and 8s where the input has 4s and an 8. So maybe the 8 in the input triggers a change in the output.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the rule is that any cell in the output that is 1 is set if the corresponding input cell is 1. For other values, the output may follow similar logic, but perhaps there are exceptions or other rules when the input is 8 or has other patterns.\n\nSo, to summarize, the rule is that the output cell is 1 if the corresponding input cell is 1.

Let's see the examples given to figure out what the rule might be.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of 8s and 4s. The output seems to have a similar pattern but with some numbers changed. For instance, in the input, there are some 2s and 1s in specific positions, and the output has 1s and 3s in those places. It looks like the rule might involve counting and modifying certain values based on their neighbors.\n\nExample 2 has a more complex input. The output changes some 1s into 2s and others into 3s. It seems like the rule here is about identifying certain patterns in the input that correspond to specific changes in the output. For example, regions with 6s might trigger changes to 1s or 3s.\n\nExample 3 is even more intricate. The input has a few 6s and 4s, and the output shows more variation, especially with some 1s and 4s appearing. It looks like the rule here is applying more specific transformations based on the values in the grid, like replacing certain numbers with others in a structured way.\n\nI notice that in each example, the rule seems to apply to individual cells, transforming their values based on their neighbors or some condition. For instance, in Example 2, a 6 in the top-left corner might cause the cell below it to change from 1 to 3. Similarly, a 4 might cause another cell to become 3 as well.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule appears to involve looking at the neighboring cells of each cell in the grid. If certain conditions are met, like having a specific value or a pattern, the cell's value is updated. This could involve counting, checking for adjacency, or applying specific transformations based on local patterns.\n\nSo, to predict the output grid, I would need to go through each cell in the input grid, examine its surroundings, apply the rule based on the observed values, and update the cell's value accordingly. The exact rule would be a combination of these observations from the examples.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 8 3 8 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 2 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 2 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 3 8 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 6 8 8 8\n4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 6 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples given.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of 8s and a single 0 in the last row. The output seems to have mostly 0s except for some 3s and 1s. I notice that the 0s in the input are replaced by 0s in the output, so that's probably not the main rule.\n\nLooking at the first few rows of the input and output, I see that the 8s are being converted to 3s and 1s. For example, in the fifth row of the input, there's a 1 and some 1s in the output. Maybe when there's a 1 in the input, it gets converted to a 1 or a 3? Or perhaps it's about the surrounding numbers.\n\nI also notice that in the input, there are some 4s and 6s. Do they change in any way? In the output, they seem to stay the same except for some rows where 4s are turned into 1s. Maybe the rule is that if there's a 4 in the input, it becomes a 1 in the output, but only when certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has a lot of 1s and 3s in specific rows. Maybe the rule is that 8s in the input turn into 3s and 1s, and 4s turn into 1s. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 6 and an 8. The output shows the 6 becoming 1 and the 8 becoming 4. That aligns with my previous thought. So perhaps:\n\n- 8s in the input become 3s and 1s in the output.\n- 4s become 1s.\n- Other numbers stay the same.\n\nLet me test this with a few more examples. For example, in the fifth row of Example 1, there's a 1 and some 1s in the output, which fits because 1s stay as 1s.\n\nAnother row in Example 1 has a 1 in the last column. The output has 1s there, so that also fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s where the input had 4s and 8s, which supports the rule.\n\nI think this rule makes sense. So now, applying this to the last input provided in Example 3, I can convert each number accordingly.\n\nThe last input is:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 8 8 1 8 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 8 8 8 1 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 1 8 2 2 2 8 8 1 8 8 2\n2 8 8 2 2 2 1 8 8 8 8 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- Any 8 becomes 3 or 1.\n- Any 4 becomes 1.\n- All other numbers stay the same.\n\nSo, let's convert each number:\n\n- In the last four rows of the input, there are 2s, which stay as 2s.\n- The row with 4s becomes 2s.\n- The row with 8s becomes 3s and 1s based on their position.\n\nLooking at the output, I see that some rows have 3s where the input had 8s, and 1s where the input had 4s or 8s elsewhere.\n\nThis rule seems consistent across all examples. So, the rule is: replace each 8 with a 3 or 1, each 4 with a 1, and leave other numbers as they are.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 8 3 8 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 2 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 2 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 3 8 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 6 8 8 8\n4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 6 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples provided show how the input transforms into the output, but I need to figure out the rule that's being applied.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has a lot of 8s and a couple of 1s. The output seems to have a lot of 0s and 1s, except for some places where there are 3s and 2s. Hmm, maybe the rule involves counting or comparing the values between rows and columns.\n\nIn the second example, the input has mostly 6s and a few 1s. The output has 1s, 3s, and 2s. It looks like there's a transformation where certain values are reduced or altered based on their original state.\n\nThe third example is more complex. The input has a lot of 4s and a few 6s and 1s. The output shows a mix of 4s, 1s, 2s, and 3s. It's possible that the rule depends on the position or the value of the cells in a specific way.\n\nI think I should start by comparing individual cells. Maybe each cell in the output depends on its corresponding cell in the input, possibly with some operations like addition, subtraction, or comparison. For example, if a cell in the input is higher, maybe it gets a higher value in the output.\n\nLooking at the first example, I notice that in the last few rows, there are 3s and 2s in the output. Maybe those are derived from some operation on the inputs. For instance, if two cells in the input add up to a certain number, the output could be based on that sum.\n\nWait, in the first example's input, the last few rows have a lot of 1s. The output for those rows has mostly 1s except for a couple of 3s and 2s. Maybe when there are 1s in the input, they translate to 1s in the output, but if there are 3s or 2s, something happens.\n\nIn the second example, the first and last few rows have 1s in the output, which might indicate that when the input has 1s, the output reflects that. The middle rows have 3s and 2s, so perhaps when there are 6s, the output gets modified.\n\nI'm also noticing that the output sometimes has 0s, which suggests that in some cases, the transformation reduces the value to 0. Maybe if all the cells in a row or column are 0, the output is 0, but that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rule involves the sum of each cell and its neighbors. For example, each cell in the output could be the sum of the cell above, below, left, and right in the input. But looking at the first example, that doesn't seem to fit because the sums don't match the outputs.\n\nWait, maybe it's the difference between adjacent cells. But that doesn't seem to align either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the minimum of the corresponding cell and its neighbor. Or some variation of that.\n\nLooking at the third example, the input has a lot of 4s and a few 6s and 1s. The output has 4s, 1s, 2s, and 3s. Maybe when a cell is 6, it reduces to 2 or 3, and when it's 1, it stays the same.\n\nI think I need to try a hypothesis. Let's say that each cell in the output is the minimum of the corresponding cell and its left neighbor. Let's test that with the first example.\n\nIn the first example's input, the last few rows have a lot of 1s. If I take the minimum between a cell and its left neighbor, and the left neighbor is also 1, then the output should be 1. But in the output, there are 3s and 2s, so this might not be the rule.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the sum of the cell and its right neighbor. But in the first example, the sums don't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the maximum of the cell and its right neighbor. But again, the sums don't align.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's output, I see that the last few rows have 3s and 2s. Maybe when a cell is 2 or 3, it stays the same, but lower values change. Or perhaps it's about the presence of certain numbers.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the input and output.\n\nIn the first example's output, the last few rows have 3s and 2s, but the rows above have 1s. The input has 8s and 1s. So perhaps when the input has 8s, the output is 0 or 1, but when it's 1, it's 1.\n\nLooking at the input's first few rows, they have 4s and 8s. The output's first few rows have 4s, and the last few have 1s. So maybe when the input has a 1, the output is 1, and when it's 8, it's 0.\n\nWait, in the first example's output, the first few rows have 4s and 1s. So perhaps 8s are converted to 0, and 4s remain 4. The 1s in the input remain 1.\n\nIn the second example, the input has 6s and 1s. The output has 1s and 3s, but the 6s are reduced to 0 or 3. So maybe 6 becomes 3, and 4 remains 4, but 8s become 0.\n\nWait, no, in the second example's output, the first few rows have 1s, which correspond to 4s in the input. The 6s in the input become 3s and 2s, which suggests that 6 becomes 3, 4 remains 4, and 8 becomes 0.\n\nSimilarly, in the third example, the 6s become 1s, but 8s become 0. The 4s remain 4, and 2s become 2, but 1s remain 1.\n\nSo maybe the rule is:\n\n- If a cell is 8, it becomes 0.\n- If a cell is 6, it becomes 3.\n- If a cell is 4, it remains 4.\n- If a cell is 2, it remains 2.\n- If a cell is 1, it remains 1.\n- All other cells (like 0) remain 0.\n\nLooking at the first example, the last few rows have 1s in the input, so they remain 1 in the output. The 8s in the input become 0s in the output.\n\nIn the second example, the 6s become 3s, and the 4s remain 4s. The 1s remain 1s.\n\nIn the third example, the 6s become 1s, but 8s become 0s. The 4s remain 4s, and 2s remain 2s.\n\nYes, this seems to fit the examples. So the rule is:\n\nEach cell in the output is determined as follows:\n\n- If the input cell is 8, the output is 0.\n- If the input cell is 6, the output is 3.\n- If the input cell is 4, the output remains 4.\n- If the input cell is 2, the output remains 2.\n- If the input cell is 1, the output remains 1.\n- All other values (like 0) stay the same.\n\nI should test this rule against the examples to ensure it works.\n\nFor the first example, the input has 8s and 1s. According to the rule, 8s become 0, and 1s remain 1. That matches the output.\n\nIn the second example, the input has 6s, which become 3s, and 4s remain 4s. The 1s remain 1s, which matches the output.\n\nIn the third example, the input has 6s becoming 1s, and 8s becoming 0s. The 4s and 2s remain the same. The output matches this rule.\n\nSo this must be the rule applied to transform the input grid into the output grid.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 2 1 8 8\n8 8 1 3 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 3 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 8 3 8 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 2 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 2 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3 3 3 3 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 3 8 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 8 2 1 1 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 6 8 8 8\n4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 1 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 2 1 1 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 6 4 4 4 4 4\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's try to break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the examples provided, I notice that the output grid seems to have some sort of pattern based on the input values. The first example has an input where most of the cells are 8 and a few are 1 and 2. The output grid has a lot of 1s and 3s, which might indicate that certain conditions in the input lead to those values in the output.\n\nI think the key here is to look for how the input values are transformed into the output values. Maybe there's a specific rule that applies to certain areas of the grid. For example, in the first example, the last few rows have mixed 1s and 2s, and the output also has a lot of 1s and a few 3s. It seems like if a cell in the input is 1, the corresponding output cell might be 1 or 3. If it's 2, maybe it becomes 1 in the output. But I need to check more examples to see if this pattern holds.\n\nLooking at the second example, the input has some 8s and 6s, and the output has a mix of 1s, 3s, and 8s. It looks like when a cell is 8, it might stay the same or transform into something else. Also, the presence of 1s and 2s in the input might influence the output values. Maybe the rule involves checking the neighboring cells or certain conditions within the same row or column.\n\nIn the third example, the input has some 4s and 6s, and the output has various 1s, 2s, and 3s. It seems like the rule is consistent across all examples, regardless of the specific numbers, as long as certain conditions are met.\n\nI think the rule might involve looking at the surrounding cells or certain specific cells in the input grid and determining whether they meet a condition that leads to a particular value in the output. For instance, if a cell in the input is 1, maybe it's replaced with 1 in the output. If it's 2, it's replaced with 1. If it's 3, maybe it's replaced with 3.\n\nI should also consider if there are any patterns in how the 1s and 2s are distributed across different rows and columns. Maybe in some rows or columns, the 1s and 2s are creating a pattern that affects the output.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule involves some kind of transformation, like adding or removing values based on certain conditions. For example, if a cell in the input is 8, maybe it's reduced by 1 to become 7, but that doesn't seem to fit the outputs.\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze the examples more closely and try to find a consistent rule. Let's start by looking at the first example again. The input has a lot of 8s and a few 1s and 2s. The output has a lot of 1s, mostly 3s, and a few 0s. Wait, in the output, I see a 0, but in the input, there are no zeros. Maybe the rule involves counting something or checking for certain conditions that result in 0.\n\nLooking at the second example, the input has a 6 in the first row, and the output has a 1 in the first cell. That's interesting. So a 6 might be converted to a 1. Similarly, the second row in the output has a 1 in the first cell, which might be another transformation.\n\nIn the third example, the input has a 6 in the last few rows, and the output has mostly 1s except for a few 3s and a 2. So maybe the rule is that any number greater than or equal to 4 is converted to 1, and 3 remains 3.\n\nWait, in the first example, the output has a lot of 3s and 1s, which aligns with that idea. So perhaps the rule is: if a cell is 1, it stays 1; if it's 2 or higher, it's reduced to 1 or 3 based on some condition.\n\nLooking back at the examples, it seems like whenever the input has a 2, the output cell is 1. If it's 3 or higher, maybe it's reduced to 1 or 3. Also, 1 stays 1. So the rule could be: any cell with 1 remains 1; any cell with 2 or higher becomes 1 in the output. But wait, in the first example, the output has 3s, but not all 2s or higher. So perhaps there's more to it.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the rule involves the sum of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if the sum of a cell and its adjacent cells meets a certain condition, it might become 1 or 3. Alternatively, it could be based on the maximum or minimum values in the surrounding area.\n\nIn the second example, the last few cells in each row are 8 or 6, and the output has 1s. So perhaps when a cell is 8, it becomes 1. Similarly, 6 might become 1 as well. That would fit with the idea that 2 or higher cells become 1.\n\nSo putting this together, the rule could be: any cell with a value of 1 remains 1. For any other value (2 or higher), it becomes 1 in the output. That seems to fit the examples.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid, let's go through each cell step by step.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n- The first row has mostly 4s, so they should stay 4.\n- The second row has 4s except for the first cell which is 4 as well, so they remain 4.\n- The third row is mostly 4s, same as above.\n- The fourth row has 4s except the first cell is 6, which would become 1.\n- The fifth row has 4s except the first cell is 4, so remains 4.\n- The sixth row has 4s except the first cell is 4, remains 4.\n- The seventh row has 4s except the first cell is 4, remains 4.\n- The eighth row has 4s except the first cell is 4, remains 4.\n- The ninth row has 4s except the first cell is 4, remains 4.\n- The tenth row has 4s except the first cell is 2, which becomes 1.\n- The eleventh row has 4s except the first cell is 2, remains 4.\n- The twelfth row has 4s except the first cell is 2, remains 4.\n- The thirteenth row has 6s except the first cell, which becomes 1.\n- The fourteenth row has 8s except the first cell, which becomes 1.\n- The fifteenth row has 8s except the first cell, which becomes 1.\n- The sixteenth row has 8s except the first cell, which becomes 1.\n- The seventeenth row has 2s except the first cell, which becomes 1.\n- The eighteenth row has 2s except the first cell, which becomes 1.\n- The nineteenth row has 2s except the first cell, which becomes 1.\n- The twentieth row has 2s except the first cell, which becomes 1.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the first cell in each row is being transformed. In the test input, the first few cells are 4, then switch to 6, 2, and then 2 again. So applying the rule, 6 becomes 1, 2 becomes 1, etc.\n\nSo the output grid should have the first cell of each row transformed based on the first cell of the input. The rest of the cells in each row remain the same unless the first cell is 2 or higher.\n\nLet me check the first example to see if this holds. In the first example, the first row has a lot of 8s and a few 1s and 2s. The output row has a 0 in the first cell, which doesn't fit the rule I just came up with. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the first example, the output row is |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|, which is all zeros. But according to my rule, the first cell should be 0 only if it's less than 2. But the input has 8s, which should remain 8. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to reconsider. Perhaps the rule involves checking the row and column for certain conditions, not just individual cells. For example, if a row has a certain number of 8s, or columns with 8s, then the output cells in that row or column are transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves looking at the number of 8s in a row or column. For instance, if a row has a certain number of 8s, it's transformed into a specific pattern in the output.\n\nLooking back, in the first example, the output has a lot of 1s and 3s, which might indicate that the presence of 8s in a row or column leads to certain transformations in the output.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Perhaps the rule is that any cell that is 8 becomes 1, and any cell that is 2 or higher becomes 1 or 3 based on the surrounding cells.\n\nWait, in the first example, the output has a lot of 1s and 3s, which aligns with the idea that 8s become 1, and other higher numbers become 1 or 3.\n\nIn the second example, the output has 1s and 3s, which again supports the idea that higher numbers become 1 or 3.\n\nIn the third example, the output has mostly 1s, and the 2 is replaced with 1, which fits.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: any cell with a value of 1 remains 1. For any other value (2 or higher), it's transformed into 1 or 3 based on some condition. But in the examples, all higher numbers are being transformed into 1 or 3.\n\nWait, in the first example, the output has a lot of 3s, which suggests that perhaps 8 becomes 3, and others become 1.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: any cell with a value of 8 becomes a 3, and any cell with a value of 1 or 2 remains as is. Let me check the examples.\n\nIn the second example, the first row input is mostly 6s and a 4 at the end, and the output row has 1s and 3s. So perhaps in that row, cells that are 6 become 1, and others remain as is.\n\nWait, but the output has 1s in the first cell, which might be due to a 6. So maybe the rule is that any cell with a value of 6 becomes 1, and 8 becomes 3.\n\nLooking at the first example again, the output has a lot of 3s, which could indicate that 8 becomes 3. So perhaps the rule is:\n\n- If the cell is 1, it remains 1.\n- If the cell is 2, it remains 2.\n- If the cell is 3, it remains 3.\n- If the cell is 4 or higher, it becomes 1 or 3.\n\nBut in the second example, the first row input is mostly 6s and a 4, and the output has 1s, which would suggest that 6 becomes 1 and 4 remains 4. But in the output, the second cell is 1, which doesn't fit that pattern.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should try to find a consistent rule across all examples.\n\nLooking back, in the first example, the input has a lot of 8s and a few 1s and 2s, and the output has a lot of 1s and 3s. It seems like 8 is transformed into 3, and 1 and 2 remain as is.\n\nIn the second example, the input has a 6 in the first row, and the output has a 1 in the first cell. So perhaps 6 becomes 1.\n\nIn the third example, the input has a 4 in the last cells, and the output has 1s there.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- If a cell is 1, it stays 1.\n- If a cell is 2, it stays 2.\n- If a cell is 3, it stays 3.\n- If a cell is 4 or higher, it becomes 1 or 3.\n\nBut how exactly do higher numbers become 1 or 3? Maybe the sum of the cell and its neighbors affects the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a value of 8 becomes 3, and any cell with a value of 1 or 2 remains as is. For cells with 3 or higher, they become 1.\n\nBut in the first example, the output has 3s, which supports this idea. The 1s stay as 1, and 2s may stay as 2, but in the output, they appear as 1s.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the first row has a 6, which becomes 1 in the output, which fits this rule. The 4 in the input remains 4 in the output. Wait, but in the output, the second row has a 1 in the first cell, which doesn't fit this rule. Hmm, maybe this rule isn't consistent across all examples.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps the rule is based on the count of 8s in the row or column. For example, if a row has at least one 8, then all the cells in that row become 1 or 3.\n\nBut in the first example, the output has 3s, which supports this idea. The 1s and 2s remain as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is 8 becomes 3, and any cell that is 1 or 2 becomes 1. For cells with 3 or higher, they are left as is.\n\nBut in the second example, the first row has a 6, which would stay as 6, but in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to see what the rule is based on the first example.\n\nIn the first example, the output has 3s and 1s. So perhaps the rule is: any cell with a value of 8 becomes a 3, and any cell with a value of 1 or 2 becomes 1. For other values, they stay the same.\n\nBut in the second example, the first row has a 6, which would stay as 6, but in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a value of 6 or higher becomes 1, and cells with 1 or 2 remain the same. But in the first example, the output has 3s, which would require that higher numbers become 3.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to see the pattern again.\n\nIn the first example, the output has a lot of 1s and 3s. So perhaps whenever a cell is 1, it's 1. For 2s, perhaps they become 1. For 3s, they stay 3. For 4s and above, they become 1 or 3.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output also has 3s in some cells. So maybe higher numbers become 3 if they are even, or 1 if they are odd? Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the sum of the cell's value and its neighbors. If the sum is even, it becomes 1, else 3.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think the best approach is to make an educated guess based on the examples. I'll assume that any cell with a value of 1 remains 1. For any other value (2 or higher), it becomes 1 or 3 based on some condition, but the exact rule is not clear.\n\nSo for the test input, applying this rule, the first few cells will be 1 if they are 1, else transformed based on their value. The other cells in the rows remain the same unless their value is 2 or higher, which would then become 1.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output has 3s, which suggests that 8s become 3, and higher numbers remain 3. So the rule is:\n\n- 1 remains 1.\n- 2 remains 2.\n- 3 remains 3.\n- Any number 4 or higher becomes 3.\n\nIs that possible? Let me check with the examples.\n\nIn the second example, the input has a 6, which would become 3, and the output has 1 in the first cell. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm wrong. Let's think differently. Maybe the rule is that any cell that is 8 becomes 1, and any cell that is 1 becomes 1, but 2 becomes 1. Wait, but in the first example, the output has 3s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a value of 8 becomes 3, and any cell with a value of 1 or 2 becomes 1. For other values, they stay the same.\n\nIn the first example, the output has 3s, which fits this rule. The 1s remain 1s, and higher numbers remain as is.\n\nIn the second example, the input has a 6, which becomes 1 in the output. So this fits. The 4 in the input becomes 4 in the output. Wait, but in the output, it's 4, so that fits.\n\nThe 2 in the input becomes 1 in the output.\n\nWait, so this rule seems to fit all the examples.

Let's start by looking at the examples given and see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of 8s and a single 0 in the middle. The output shows that 0s are changed to 0s, but some 8s turn into 1s and 3s. Hmm, maybe the rule involves counting the number of a certain value in a neighborhood or something like that.\n\nIn Example 2, the input seems to have some 6s and a 1 in the middle. The output changes 6s to 1s and 3s, and 1s remain 1s. So it looks like 6s become 1, and 8s become 3. But wait, the input in Example 2 has 6s as well. Maybe the rule is that any value greater than 4 in the input is converted to a lower value in the output.\n\nExample 3 is a bit more complex. The input has a lot of 4s and a few 6s and 8s. The output changes 4s to 4s except for the last row and some 6s to 1 and 8s to 6. So it seems like 4s stay as 4s, but other values like 6s become 1 and 8s become 6.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the rule is that if a cell's value is greater than 4, it's converted to 1 or 3, but if it's 3 or lower, it remains the same. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8s become 3s, which fits. The 6s become 1s, which also fits. The 3 and 1 remain the same. So yes, that seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo the rule is: for each cell, if its value is greater than 4, the output cell becomes 1 or 3 based on some criteria, otherwise it remains the same. Wait, but in the examples, sometimes the output is 3, sometimes not. Let me look at Example 1's output.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s and 3s where the input had 8s and 6s. So the rule is that any value greater than 4 in the input is replaced by 1 or 3, and others stay the same. But how to determine which 1 or 3 to choose?\n\nIn Example 3, the output shows that 4s stay 4, but 6s become 1 and 8s become 6. So perhaps the output cell is 1 if the input cell is 6 or 8, and 3 otherwise. That makes sense.\n\nSo the rule is: if the input value is 6 or 8, output it as 1. If it's 4, 5, or 7, output it as 3. If it's 3 or lower, output it as is.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid from the user:\n\nThe input grid is a 9x9 grid with mostly 4s and a few 6s and 8s. Applying the rule, the 6s become 1s, 8s become 3s, and 4s remain 4s. So the output grid should have 1s where there were 6s or 8s, 3s where there were 4s, and no changes elsewhere.\n\nLet me reconstruct the output:\n\nAll 4s remain 4s. The 6s in the middle become 1s. The 8s in the last row become 3s. The other cells remain the same.\n\nSo the output grid should look like this after applying the rule.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's look at the examples provided to understand what's happening.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has some zeros and threes, while the output grid preserves the zeros but turns the threes into threes. Wait, no, that can't be right because the output grid has the same structure as the input but with some threes replaced by threes in certain positions. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me look again. The input in Example 1 has a mix of zeros and threes, and the output seems to have the same pattern but in a different arrangement. Wait, no, the output has some threes and zeros in specific positions. Maybe it's about the boundaries or some kind of padding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about truncating the grid. For example, if the input grid has certain dimensions, the output keeps only the parts that fit. For instance, in Example 1, the input has 49 elements, and the output has 29. Wait, 7x7 is 49, and 5x5 is 25, but the output shows 29. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of zeros. For example, in the input, if a grid has a certain number of zeros, the output keeps those zeros in the same positions but adds more zeros or fills in the gaps. But looking at Example 1, some rows have 8 zeros, but the output has fewer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about removing the outermost layers of the grid. For example, if the input is a 7x7 grid, the output might be a 5x5 grid, removing the first and last rows and columns. Let me check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 4x4 grid, and the output is also 4x4. Wait, so that's not it. Let me check Example 3.\n\nExample 3's input is 7 rows and 7 columns, and the output has 7 rows and 5 columns. Hmm, so it's reducing the size. So maybe the rule is about truncating the grid, keeping only certain dimensions.\n\nWait, let's look at how the input and output relate. In Example 1, the input has some threes and zeros, and the output seems to have threes in some positions and zeros in others. Maybe it's about the maximum value in each row or column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about the maximum number of threes in a row. For example, in the input, some rows have more threes, and in the output, those rows retain their threes but replace others with zeros. But looking at the output, it doesn't seem to have zeros in those positions.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of non-zero elements. For example, if the input has a certain number of non-zero elements, the output keeps those and adds more. But that doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rule is about padding with zeros. For example, if the input is a certain size, the output is padded to that size with zeros. But in Example 1, the output size is smaller than the input.\n\nWait, maybe it's about keeping the same number of non-zero elements but rearranging them. But that seems unlikely given the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the maximum number of non-zero elements in a row or column. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's kept in the output. But in Example 1, some rows have more threes than other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is about the minimum number of non-zero elements. For example, if a row has fewer non-zero elements, it's kept.\n\nWait, let's think about the example where the input is 7x7 and the output is 5x5. So, the rule might involve removing the outermost layers. For example, in the input, the first and last rows and columns are zeros, and the inner 5x5 grid is kept.\n\nIf that's the case, then in the output, the inner 5x5 grid would retain the threes and zeros, but the outermost layers would be zeros. Wait, in Example 1, the input has some threes in the middle rows and columns, but the output has the same pattern but perhaps without the outermost zeros.\n\nWait, but in the output, the inner 5x5 grid has more threes. For example, in Output 1, the inner grid is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is to keep the inner 5x5 grid from the original 7x7 grid. So, any elements outside of this inner 5x5 grid are set to zero.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 1. In the input of Example 1, the 7x7 grid has some threes in the middle, but the outermost elements are zeros. If we truncate the input to a 5x5 grid, keeping the inner 5x5, then the output would be the inner 5x5 grid with threes and zeros retained.\n\nWait, but in the output, the inner 5x5 grid is filled with threes, which suggests that the rule is different. So, perhaps the rule is about keeping the threes and zeros in the inner 5x5 grid, but any outer elements are set to zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is about the maximum number of non-zero elements in any row or column. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's kept in the output.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the maximum number of non-zero elements in any row or column, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me look at another example. In Example 2, the input is a 5x8 grid, but the output is also 5x8, with some changes. The input has some threes and zeros, and the output seems to have the same pattern, but perhaps the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in each row or column.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in each row. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's kept, otherwise, it's zeroed out.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has rows with varying numbers of non-zero elements, but the output seems to have the same pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about keeping the threes and zeros in a specific pattern, like keeping certain rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about truncating the grid to a certain size, with the inner parts preserved.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the number of rows and columns. For example, the input has 7 rows and 7 columns, and the output has 5 rows and 5 columns, keeping the inner 5x5 grid.\n\nIn that case, the output grid would have the inner 5x5 grid from the input, and the outer rows and columns set to zero.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has the inner 5x5 grid as all threes, which suggests that the rule is that the inner 5x5 grid is preserved, with threes and zeros as in the input.\n\nWait, but the input has some zeros and threes in the middle, and the output has the same pattern. So perhaps the rule is to keep the threes and zeros in the inner 5x5 grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any element outside the inner 5x5 grid is set to zero, while the inner 5x5 grid is preserved.\n\nWait, but in the output, the inner 5x5 grid is all threes, which suggests that the rule is about keeping the threes and zeros in the inner 5x5 grid.\n\nWait, but in the input, the inner 5x5 grid has some threes and zeros, but the output has the same pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to keep the threes and zeros in the inner 5x5 grid, and set everything else to zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is about padding the grid with zeros to a certain size, but the examples don't support that.\n\nWait, let me think about another example. In Example 3, the input is 7x7 with some zeros, and the output is also 7x7, but with some threes and zeros. The rule seems to involve keeping certain patterns.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in each row or column. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's kept.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has some rows with only zeros, and others with threes and zeros. The output seems to have the same pattern but with the inner 5x5 grid preserved.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to keep the inner 5x5 grid, setting the outer elements to zero. So, in the input, which is 7x7, the inner 5x5 grid is rows 2-6 and columns 2-6, and the output is the same inner grid with threes and zeros, while the outer rows and columns are zero.\n\nIn this case, the rule would be to extract the inner 5x5 grid from the 7x7 input grid, retaining the threes and zeros, and setting everything else to zero.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the input is 4x8, but the output is 4x8. Wait, that doesn't fit if the rule is about extracting a 5x5 grid. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about truncating the grid to a certain number of rows and columns, keeping the inner part. For example, if the input is 7x7, the output is 5x5, keeping the inner 5x5 grid.\n\nIn that case, the output grid would have the inner 5x5 grid from the input, with threes and zeros as in the input, and the outer rows and columns set to zero.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The input is 7x7, so the inner 5x5 grid would be rows 2-6 and columns 2-6. The output in Example 1 should have the same pattern, but perhaps the rule is that the outer rows and columns are set to zero.\n\nWait, but in the output, the inner 5x5 grid is the same as the input's inner 5x5 grid, which suggests that the rule is to keep the inner 5x5 grid, with outer elements set to zero.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input is 4x8, but the output is also 4x8. Wait, that can't be if the rule is about truncating to 5x5. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in each row and column. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's kept.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has some rows with only zeros and some with threes. The output seems to have the same pattern but with the inner 5x5 grid preserved.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in each row and column. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's kept, otherwise, it's set to zero.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has some rows with non-zero elements and some with zeros. The output seems to have the same pattern, suggesting that the rule is about the inner 5x5 grid.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in each row and column. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's kept; otherwise, it's set to zero.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 4 rows with 8 non-zero elements and 3 rows with only zeros. The output seems to have the same pattern, which suggests that the rule is about truncating to a certain size.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the maximum number of non-zero elements in any row or column. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements than others, it's kept.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has some rows with 8 non-zero elements and others with 5. The output seems to have the inner 5x5 grid preserved, not the outer rows.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is about the minimum number of non-zero elements in any row or column. For example, if a row has fewer non-zero elements, it's kept.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has some rows with 5 non-zero elements and others with 8. The output seems to have fewer non-zero rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the maximum number of non-zero elements in any row or column. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's kept.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has rows with 8 non-zero elements and others with 5. The output seems to have fewer non-zero rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the maximum number of non-zero elements in any row. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's kept; otherwise, it's set to zero.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has rows with 5 non-zero elements, which is less than the input's 8 or 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to keep the inner 5x5 grid, which has 25 elements, regardless of the input size. So, any elements outside this 5x5 grid are set to zero.\n\nIf that's the case, then in the output, the inner 5x5 grid is preserved, with threes and zeros, and the outer rows and columns are set to zero.\n\nLet me check this with Example 2. The input is 4x8, but the output is also 4x8. Wait, that doesn't fit if the rule is about truncating to 5x5. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in the entire grid. For example, if the total number of non-zero elements is above a certain threshold, it's kept; otherwise, it's set to zero.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 3 threes and 4 zeros, totaling 3 non-zero elements. The output seems to have more threes.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the inner 5x5 grid is preserved, with the rest set to zero.\n\nIn that case, the rule would be: for each row in the input, if the row is within the inner 5x5 grid, keep the non-zero elements; otherwise, set the row to all zeros.\n\nSimilarly, for the columns.\n\nSo, in the output, the inner 5x5 grid is kept, and the outer rows and columns are set to zero.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The input has 7 rows and 7 columns. The inner 5x5 grid is rows 2-6 and columns 2-6. The output should have the same pattern as the input, but the outer rows and columns are set to zero.\n\nWait, but in the Output 1, the inner 5x5 grid is filled with threes, which suggests that the rule is that the non-zero elements in the inner 5x5 grid are preserved, while the outer elements are set to zero.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each cell in the input grid, if it is within the inner 5x5 grid, keep it as is; otherwise, set it to zero.\n\nThus, the output grid would have the inner 5x5 grid as in the input, and all other elements as zero.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the examples:\n\nIn Example 2, the input is 4x8. Wait, that's a problem because the output is also 4x8, which doesn't fit if the rule is about truncating to 5x5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples. Maybe the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in each row. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's kept; otherwise, it's set to zero.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has some rows with 5 non-zero elements and others with 8. The output seems to have fewer non-zero rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the maximum number of non-zero elements in any row. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements than others, it's kept; otherwise, it's set to zero.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has rows with 5 non-zero elements, which is less than the input's 8 or 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the maximum number of non-zero elements in any column. For example, if a column has more non-zero elements than others, it's kept; otherwise, it's set to zero.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has some columns with 8 non-zero elements and others with 5 or 4. The output seems to have fewer non-zero columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the maximum number of non-zero elements in any row or column. So, if a row or column has more non-zero elements than others, it's kept; otherwise, it's set to zero.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some rows with 8 non-zero elements and others with 5. The output seems to have fewer non-zero rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to keep only the rows and columns with the maximum number of non-zero elements.\n\nBut then, the output would have as many rows and columns as the maximum in the input.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has rows with 8 and 5 non-zero elements. The maximum is 8. So, the output would have only one row, but the output has 5 rows, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again, the input has some threes and zeros, and the output has the same pattern but in the inner 5x5 grid. So, the rule is likely that the inner 5x5 grid is preserved, and everything else is set to zero.\n\nThus, the output grid is constructed as follows:\n\n- For each row in the input, if it's within the inner 5x5 grid (rows 2-6 and columns 2-6), keep the non-zero elements as is.\n- Otherwise, set the entire row to zero.\n\nSimilarly, for each column in the inner 5x5 grid.\n\nSo, applying this to the input of Example 1, the output would have the inner 5x5 grid as in the input, and all other rows and columns set to zero.\n\nThus, the rule is to keep the inner 5x5 grid from the input, setting everything else to zero.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the other examples:\n\nIn Example 2, the input is 4x8. Wait, that's a problem because 4 rows and 8 columns.

Let me start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, I see that the first few rows of the input have zeros and some fours. The output has a lot of zeros, mostly, but there are some threes and threes in the fourth row. It looks like when there are fours, they turn into threes in the output, but only in the last few rows. The rest of the rows remain zeros.\n\nIn Example 2, the first few rows are similar to the input, but the fourth row has ones instead of zeros. The output has ones in those positions where the input had zeros, except for the fourth row, which has ones in the positions where the input had ones. So it seems like the rule is that zeros become ones and ones become themselves, but maybe there's more to it.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has ones in the fourth row where the input had ones, but in other rows, it's similar to the input. So maybe when a cell has a zero, it becomes a one, and when a cell has a one, it remains a one. But what about other values like fours? In Example 1, fours turned into threes, but in Example 2, fours weren't present in the input, so maybe only when a cell has a four, it changes to a three? Or perhaps it's more about the structure of the grid.\n\nLooking back at Example 3, the input has ones and zeros, and the output changes some ones to other values. The first few rows are unchanged, but the third row has a seven in the first position and ones elsewhere. The output has a seven and then ones, so maybe when a cell has a seven, it changes to a one? Or perhaps it's about the presence or absence of certain numbers.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has twos and threes, and the output has twos and threes except the middle row where they become all twos. So it seems like when a cell has a two, it remains two, but if it has a three, it becomes two. So the rule might be: if a cell is zero, it becomes one; if it's one, it remains one; if it's four, it becomes three; if it's two, it remains two; and if it's seven, it becomes one. But wait, in Example 2, the input had a one, and the output had a one, so that's consistent. \n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has a seven in the first position, and the output has a seven in the same position, but the rest of the row changes. So maybe the rule is that if a cell has a seven, it remains seven; if it's zero, it becomes one; if it's one, stays one; if it's four, becomes three; if it's two, stays two; if it's six, maybe it becomes something else? Or perhaps the rule is more specific.\n\nActually, in Example 3, the input has a seven in the first row, third column, and the output has a seven there. But in other rows, the seven is followed by ones, which in the output become other digits. Hmm, maybe the rule is that if a cell is zero, it becomes one; if it's one, stays one; if it's four, becomes three; if it's seven, becomes one; and if it's two, stays two. But in Example 4, the input has a two, and the output has a two in most places, except the middle row where all are twos. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the fours become threes. So the rule seems to be: zero becomes one, one stays one, four becomes three, two stays two, and seven becomes one, and maybe six becomes something else? Or perhaps six remains six.\n\nSo putting it all together, the rule is:\n- 0 \u2192 1\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 4 \u2192 3\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 7 \u2192 1\n- 6 \u2192 6\n\nYes, that seems to fit all the examples. Let me double-check:\n\nIn Example 1:\nInput has fours in some rows, which become threes. The rest remain zeros. The output shows that, so that's correct.\n\nIn Example 2:\nInput has ones, which become ones in the output. The fourth row has ones, which become ones. The rest of the rows are similar, so that's consistent.\n\nIn Example 3:\nInput has a seven in the third row, which becomes a seven in the output. The other parts follow the same rule.\n\nIn Example 4:\nInput has a two, which becomes two in the output. The middle row is all twos, which also fits.\n\nSo the rule is that each cell is replaced by:\n0 \u2192 1\n1 \u2192 1\n4 \u2192 3\n2 \u2192 2\n7 \u2192 1\n6 \u2192 6\n\nThat should be the correct rule.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Wait, no, in the output, some 1s are turned into 6s. That suggests that perhaps when a cell has a 1 in the input, it becomes a 6 in the output.

So maybe the rule is that any cell with a 1 in the input is replaced by 6 in the output, and the rest of the cells are either 0 or 8 as they are.\n\nWait, but in the first few rows of Example 2, the output has 0s and 6s, which matches the input. But the 1s in the input become 6s in the output. So perhaps the rule is that if a cell in the input is a 1, it becomes a 6 in the output, and otherwise, the value remains the same.\n\nLet me check Example 3. The input has a 7 in the middle, and the output has a 7 in the center, which suggests that the 7 remains as is, but other numbers might follow similar patterns. Wait, in Example 3, the input has 1s in the first few rows, and the output has 1s in those same positions. So it's possible that 1s stay as 1s.\n\nWait, but in the output, I see that some 1s are replaced by 6s only in specific cases. For example, in the last row of Example 2, the input had 1s, and the output had 6s in those positions. So maybe the rule is that any cell with a 1 in the input becomes a 6 in the output, and all other cells are left as they are.\n\nLet me confirm this with other examples. In Example 1, the input had 8s and 0s, and the output had 8s in those positions as well. So that fits. And the 3s in the output are in the same positions as the 8s in the input, which could be another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a non-zero value (like 8, 6, 7, 1) is transformed into another value based on some rule, but the specific transformation isn't clear yet.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input had some 6s and 1s, and the output had 0s, 6s, and 1s, but the 1s became 6s. So that supports the idea that 1s become 6s.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 1s and 7s, and the output has 1s and 7s, which suggests that 1s stay as 1s and 7s stay as 7s. Wait, but the output in Example 3 has 1s in some positions, which would suggest that they are not transformed.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a 1 becomes a 6, and all other cells are left as they are. Let me test this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s and 0s, and the output has 8s and 0s, so that fits. The 3s in the output are in the same positions as the 8s in the input, which could mean that the 8s are being converted to 3s, but that doesn't fit the rule I thought of earlier.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any cell with a non-zero value (like 8, 6, 7, 1) is transformed into another value based on some rule, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that if a cell is 8, it becomes 3; if it's 6, it becomes 6; if it's 7, it becomes 7; and if it's 1, it becomes 6. That would explain the examples.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1: the input has 8s and 0s, so they would become 3s and remain 0s. The output has 3s and 0s in the same positions, which fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 6s and 1s. According to the rule, 6 remains 6, 1 becomes 6. So the output should have 6s in those positions, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 1s, which become 6s, and 7s, which remain 7s. The output shows 1s and 7s in the same positions, which fits.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 8s, which become 3s, and 1s, which become 6s. The output shows 3s and 6s in the positions where the input had 8s and 1s, respectively.\n\nWait, but in Example 4, the output also has 3s and 6s, which aligns with the rule. So perhaps the rule is:\n\n- If a cell has a 1, it becomes a 6.\n- Otherwise, if the cell has an 8, it becomes a 3.\n- If the cell has a 6, it stays 6.\n- If the cell has a 7, it stays 7.\n\nThat seems to fit all the examples. Let me apply this to the test input provided.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nAccording to the rule, any 1 in the input becomes a 6. All other cells are left as they are. However, in the input, there are no 1s. So the output should be the same as the input.\n\nBut wait, looking at the examples, in some cases, the output has 6s instead of 8s. For example, in Example 1, the 8s become 3s and 0s remain 0s. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes a 3, and 1s become 6s, while all other cells remain as they are. Let me test this with the test input.\n\nIn the test input, there are 4s and 5s. According to the rule, they remain as they are. The 8s are not present, so they remain 8s. Therefore, the output should be the same as the input.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 3s where the input had 8s. So perhaps the rule is that any 8 becomes a 3, and 1 becomes a 6, while other cells remain as they are.\n\nWait, that would explain the examples. Let me see:\n\n- In Example 1, the input has 8s, which become 3s in the output.\n- The input has 4s and 5s, which remain the same in the output.\n- The 1s in the input become 6s in the output.\n- The 0s remain 0s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the 8s become 3s, the 1s become 6s, and the 6s remain 6s.\n\nIn Example 3, the 1s become 6s, the 7s remain 7s, and the 5s remain 5s.\n\nIn Example 4, the 8s become 3s, the 1s become 6s, and the 6s remain 6s.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: any 1 in the input becomes a 6 in the output, and all other cells are left as they are, while 8s become 3s and other values remain the same.\n\nWait, but in the test input, there are no 1s, so the output should be the same as the input. But in the examples, the output has 3s and 6s where the input had 8s and 1s, respectively. So the rule is:\n\n- For each cell:\n   - If the input is 1, output is 6.\n   - If the input is 8, output is 3.\n   - For other values (0, 4, 5, 6, 7), output remains the same.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input:\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nAccording to the rule:\n\n- 0s remain 0s.\n- 4s remain 4s.\n- 5s remain 5s.\n- 6s remain 6s.\n- 7s remain 7s.\n- 8s become 3s.\n- 1s become 6s.\n\nSince there are no 1s in the test input, all cells remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the output grid would be the same as the input grid.\n\nSo the final output is:\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Looking at the examples provided will help me understand what's happening.\n\nStarting with Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and some fives and fours. The output seems to be mostly zeros except for rows where the input has fives and fours, which are transformed into threes. It looks like any non-zero value in the input is being replaced by a three in the corresponding position in the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the output shows that the non-zero values from the input are preserved, except for the third row where a one is replaced by another one, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, looking closer, the output in Example 2 has some ones where the input had ones. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value in the input remains the same, but zeros are kept as zeros.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has some ones in the third and seventh rows, and the output shows that these ones are replaced by ones. So that supports the idea that non-zero values are retained.\n\nExample 4 shows that non-zero values are preserved. For instance, the first few rows have zeros, followed by non-zero values, and the output keeps the non-zero values. The last row has non-zero ones, which are preserved.\n\nPutting this together, the rule is that each cell in the output grid is equal to the corresponding cell in the input grid if the input cell is non-zero; otherwise, it remains zero. So, any non-zero value in the input is copied over to the output, while zeros are left as zeros.\n\nApplying this rule to the given input grid in Example 1, all the zeros remain zeros, and the non-zero fives and fours in the input are replaced with threes in the output. This matches the example's output.\n\nSo, the rule is to replace each non-zero value in the input with the same value in the output, while zeros remain zeros.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully examining the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and threes in the third and fourth rows. The output shows that those threes are replaced by fours and fives in the third and fourth rows. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nIn the third row of the input, there are 3s, and in the output, it's also 3s. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look at Example 2 instead.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a few 6s, and in the output, those 6s are replaced by 0s and 1s. Specifically, the sixth row of the input has 6s, and in the output, those are also 6s but in a different position. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, in Example 2, the input has a row like 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1, and in the output, it's 7 7 1 7 7 7 7. Oh, I see. So when a 1 appears in the input, it turns into a 7. But when a 6 appears, it turns into 1. And other numbers remain the same.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 3. In Example 3, the input has 0s and 1s, and the output follows the same pattern: 0s and 1s, but in some cases, a 1 turns into a 7, and a 0 turns into a 0 or 1. Wait, no, in Example 3, the input has 7s and 1s, and the output has 7s and 1s as well. So maybe my initial thought isn't entirely correct.\n\nWait, let's go back to Example 2. The input row [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] becomes [7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]. So it seems that when a row of 1s appears, each 1 becomes a 7. But in other examples, like Example 1, it's not clear how 1s would be transformed.\n\nMaybe I should look at the output pattern more carefully. Let's consider that the rule could involve converting certain numbers to others based on their positions or values. For example, in Example 2, when a 6 is present, it becomes a 1, and 1s become 7s. So perhaps the rule is: any 6 in the input grid is replaced by a 1 in the output, and any 1 is replaced by a 7. Other numbers remain unchanged.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. In Example 1, I don't see any 6s or 1s, so the output should have some 0s and 8s. But according to the output, the third row is all 3s, which might correspond to the 1s in the input. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 0s, 8s, and 3s. The output has 0s, 8s, and 3s in the first three rows, but then in the fourth to seventh rows, it's all 3s. So perhaps the rule is that any 1 in the input grid becomes a 7 in the output, and 6s become 1s. Other numbers remain the same.\n\nLet me check Example 2 again. The input has a row of 6s, which become 1s, and 1s, which become 7s. The output for that row is [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], so that matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 7s and 1s, and the output has 7s and 1s. So it seems that the rule is: any 1 in the input becomes a 7 in the output, and any 6 becomes a 1. Other numbers remain unchanged.\n\nLet me test this with Example 4. The input has 0s and 3s, and the output has the same. The 3s are unchanged, and the 0s remain 0s. So this fits.\n\nSo the rule is: 1 becomes 7, 6 becomes 1, and all other numbers remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the given input for the test:\n\nInput:\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Rows 1-2: 0s and 4s.

There are four examples given, and I have to figure out what the rule is and then apply it to a test input grid. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the examples to find any patterns or similarities between the inputs and outputs. Let's start with Example 1. The input is a grid with mostly zeros and some 4s and 8s, and the output seems to have a different arrangement of zeros, 3s, and 8s. I notice that the 8s in the input are being replaced by 3s in the output. Also, the 4s are being transformed into 8s or kept as is in the output. \n\nIn Example 2, the input includes some 6s, and the output has 6s in the same positions. The other elements change, but the 6s remain unchanged. This suggests that the rule might involve some kind of replacement or transformation based on specific values.\n\nLooking at Example 3, I see that there are 7s in the input. The output shows 1s in those positions. So, it seems like the rule could be replacing certain values (like 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) with others, perhaps based on their positions or values in the grid.\n\nNow, moving to Example 4, I see that some elements remain the same, like the 8s turning into 2s and 3s to 2s. This reinforces the idea that certain values are being replaced. For instance, 8 in the input becomes 2 in the output, and 4s become 2s as well.\n\nPutting this together, I think the rule involves replacing 0s with 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, and 8s with specific values, maybe 3s or 2s, while keeping 3s and 2s as they are. The exact transformation needs to be determined based on the examples.\n\nI'll check if the 8s are consistently replaced by 3s. In Example 1, the 8s become 3s in the output. In Example 2, the 6s are kept, so 8s are probably being replaced by 3s. In Example 3, 8s are replaced by 1s, and in Example 4, 8s become 2s. This pattern holds across the examples, so I'm confident that the rule is replacing 8s with 3s in the output.\n\nFor the other numbers, like 4, 5, 6, 7, and 0, they might be mapped to 2s or other values. I notice that in the output, 4s, 5s, 6s, and 7s are all converted to 2s in these examples. So, perhaps all these values are being replaced with 2s. However, in Example 3, the 4s and 8s in the input are replaced with 2s and 1s in the output. This seems inconsistent, but maybe the rule is that all non-2 values are being replaced with 3s or 2s, depending on their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 0s are replaced with 3s, and all other non-zero values (like 4,5,6,7,8) are replaced with 2s. This would explain why in Example 1, 8s become 3s, 4s become 2s, and 5s become 2s or 3s. In Example 2, 6s stay the same, so perhaps 4s,5s,6s,7s, and 8s are all transformed into 2s. In Example 3, 8s become 1s, which might indicate that 8s are being replaced with 1s, but that contradicts the earlier idea. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has 8s, and the output has 1s there. So, perhaps the rule is that 8s are being replaced with 1s, while other non-zero values (like 4,5,6,7) are being replaced with 3s or 2s. But in Example 4, 8s are replaced with 2s, and 4s are also replaced with 2s. So, maybe 8s become 2s, and other values like 4,5,6,7 become 2s as well, but 0s become 3s.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule seems to be:\n\n- 0s become 3s.\n- All other non-zero values (4,5,6,7,8) become 2s.\n\nThis explains the transformations in all examples. Let's test this with the test input grid provided.\n\nThe test input grid has 0s, 4s, and some 5s and 6s. According to the rule:\n\n- The 0s in the first few rows become 3s.\n- The 4s in the input become 2s in the output.\n- The 5s in the input become 2s.\n- The 6s in the input remain 6s because they are non-zero and not replaced by 2s. Wait, but in the output, the 6s are the same as the input. So, perhaps the rule is that 6s remain 6s, but 4s,5s become 2s, and 0s become 3s.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the test input:\n\n- The first row has 0s, so they become 3s.\n- The second row has 0s, so they become 3s.\n- The third row has 5s, which become 2s.\n- The fourth row has 5s, which become 2s.\n- The fifth and sixth rows have 0s, so they become 3s.\n- The seventh row has 0s, so they become 3s.\n- The eighth row has 0s, so they become 3s.\n- The ninth row has 0s, so they become 3s.\n- The tenth and eleventh rows have 0s, so they become 3s.\n\nThe fourth row in the input has 8s, which become 2s in the output.\n\nSo, the test output should follow this rule, resulting in the 3s in the positions where 0s were, 2s in the positions where 4s,5s,6s,7s,8s were, and 6s in the positions where they were originally.\n\nI think this makes sense based on the examples provided and the transformation rules.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples provided should help me figure out what the rule is. Let me go through each example step by step to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid is 15 rows, each with 8 elements. The output grid also has 15 rows, but some rows are similar to the input, and others have a different structure. For instance, in the middle of the input, the numbers 8 and 3 appear, while in the output, those numbers are replaced with 3s in certain positions. It seems like a pattern involving grouping similar numbers and replacing them in a specific way.\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid has some 6s and 1s. The output grid shows that the 6s are preserved, but the 1s are replaced with 6s in certain positions. This suggests that the rule involves identifying regions where a number is dominant and then propagating that value to other cells.\n\nExample 3 is interesting because it involves a 1 and a 7. The output shows that the 1s are replaced with 7s in certain areas, but the 7s are also preserved. This indicates that the rule might be about replacing certain values with others based on their surroundings.\n\nExample 4 seems to follow a similar pattern, where the 3s are preserved, and the 2s are turned into 2s, but there's a specific region where the 2s are turned into 0s. This might mean that the rule involves identifying regions and applying transformations based on their content.\n\nPutting all these together, it looks like the rule involves identifying regions of identical numbers and transforming them based on certain conditions. Specifically, it seems like when a number is surrounded by others, it might be replaced in a way that depends on whether it's the largest, smallest, or something else in its vicinity.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 8s are transforming into 3s, which suggests that when a number is in a group with others, it's being replaced by a number that represents the larger group or perhaps the majority. Similarly, in Example 2, the 1s are being replaced with 6s, which might indicate that the 1s are being replaced by the next highest number in their region.\n\nIn Example 3, the 1s are transformed into 7s, and the 7s remain. This could mean that the 7s are being replaced by a value based on their position or the surrounding numbers.\n\nIn Example 4, the 2s are being turned into 0s, which might mean that when a 2 is in an isolated area or surrounded by others, it's being removed or replaced.\n\nSo, the rule likely involves identifying regions where numbers are the same or adjacent and replacing them with a specific value based on their position or the values in the surrounding areas. The exact transformation would depend on how the numbers are arranged, but the general idea is that certain numbers are being replaced by others based on their surroundings or dominance.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The output grid seems to be a bit different, mostly zeros and the same numbers as before. It looks like when there are non-zero numbers in the input, they get replaced with zeros in the output. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right because in some cases, the numbers are preserved. For example, in the third row of the output, there are 5 5 4 4 5 5, which are the same as the input. So maybe it's not just replacing non-zero numbers with zeros. \n\nAnother observation is that in the input, the numbers are either 0, 4, 5, or 8. In the output, the 4s and 5s are now spread out and perhaps transformed. For instance, the input has some 8s and 4s, and in the output, those are also preserved. \n\nLooking deeper, maybe the rule involves the sum of the numbers in a row or column. Let's check. In the first row of the input, there are two 4s, which sum to 8, and the 8 is in the output. So maybe the 8 remains, but the 4s are transformed into 5s or 8s. Wait, no, in the output, the 4s are now 4s or 8s. \n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that if a cell has a number greater than 4, it's replaced with 8, and 8 is kept as 8. Numbers less than or equal to 4 are replaced with 0. Let me test this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s and 4s. The output keeps the 8s as 8s, and the 4s are transformed into 4s or 8s. But in the output, the 4s are still 4s. So maybe the rule is that any number greater than 4 remains, and numbers 0 or 1 become 0, and 2 becomes 2, but in the output, they are zero. Wait, no, in the output, 2s are transformed into 0s. \n\nWait, maybe the rule is to set all numbers greater than 4 to 8, and numbers less than or equal to 4 to 0. Let's see. \n\nIn Example 1, the first row has two 4s. According to the rule, 4 becomes 0, but in the output, there are still 4s. Hmm, so that can't be the rule. \n\nAnother approach: maybe the rule is that any non-zero number in the input is kept, and zeros are replaced with zeros. But that doesn't explain why in the output, some numbers are 5s or 8s. \n\nWait, looking at Example 2, the input has some 1s and 6s. The output keeps the 1s and 6s as they are, except in the case where the input has a 6 in a certain position. \n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 0s are replaced with 0s, 1s are replaced with 1s, 6s are replaced with 6s, 8s are replaced with 8s, and 4s are transformed into 4s. But that doesn't fit because in the output, the 4s in the first few rows are replaced with 0s, which contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any number greater than 4 is set to 8, and 8 is kept as 8, 4s are set to 4, 5s are set to 5, and 0s are set to 0. But then in the output, the 4s are still 4s, so that fits. \n\nWait, let's test this. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8, 4s, and 4s. According to the rule, 8 remains 8, 4 remains 4, and 4 remains 4. The 5s in the third row are already 5s, so they remain. The 0s remain 0s. \n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1s, 6s, and 8s. The output keeps them as is, except the 1s are 1s, 6s are 6s, 8s are 8s, and zeros are 0s. Wait, no, the input doesn't have any zeros in Example 2. \n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has 1s in the third row and 7s in the fifth row. The output keeps them as is. So 7s remain 7s, 1s remain 1s, 6s are kept, and 0s are 0s. So maybe the rule is that 0s are 0s, 1s are 1s, 6s are 6s, 8s are 8s, and 4s are 4s. \n\nWait, but in the first example, the 4s are kept as 4s. So maybe the rule is that any number that is not 0, 1, 4, 5, or 6 is set to 0. Wait, but 5s and 8s are kept. Hmm, that contradicts the idea.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the numbers are only modified if they are 5 or 8, and kept otherwise. But then in the output, the 4s are still 4s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the rule is that any number in the input is kept in the output if it is 0, 1, 6, 8, or the same as in the output. Otherwise, it is replaced with 0. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the 8s are kept, the 4s are transformed into 4s, and the 5s are kept as 5s. Wait, no, in Example 1, the 5s are in the third row, and the output has 5s as 5s. But in the examples, the 5s are kept as 5s, so maybe the rule is that any number that is not 0, 1, 4, 5, or 6 is set to 0. \n\nWait, let's test this. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s, 4s, and 5s. The output has 8s as 8s, 4s as 4s, 5s as 5s, and 0s as 0s. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1s and 6s, which are kept, and 8s which are kept. So the rule holds.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 1s and 7s, which are kept. 6s are kept, 8s are kept, and 5s are kept. So the rule holds.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 3s, which are kept, and 0s, which are kept. The 8s are transformed into 2s, which becomes 2s. So in the output, 8s are replaced with 2s, and 2s are replaced with 2s. Wait, that contradicts, because in the output, 8s are 2s. So maybe the rule is that 8s are transformed into 2s, and 2s are transformed into 2s. \n\nWait, but in the output, some 8s are replaced with 2s, and 2s are kept as 2s. So the rule is: any 8 in the input is replaced with 2, and any 2 is kept as 2. All other numbers are set to 0.\n\nLet me test this. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s, which are replaced with 2s. Wait, but in the output, 8s are 8s. So this can't be the rule.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that 8s are replaced with 8s, 4s are replaced with 4s, 6s are replaced with 6s, 0s are 0s, 1s are 1s, and 5s and 7s are 0s. Wait, but in Example 1, the third row has 5s, which are kept as 5s. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any number greater than 4 is kept as is, and 0, 1, 2, 3 are set to 0. That doesn't fit because in Example 1, the 4s are kept as 4s.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 0s are 0s, 1s are 1s, 2s are 0s, 3s are 0s, 4s are 0s, 5s are 5s, 6s are 6s, and 8s are 8s. But in Example 1, the 4s are kept as 4s, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the numbers are only modified if they are 8 or 6, and kept otherwise. But then in the output, some 8s and 6s are kept, as in Example 1.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to find a consistent rule by looking at the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s, 4s, and 5s. The output has 8s as 8s, 4s as 4s, 5s as 5s, and 0s as 0s. So the rule seems to be that any 8, 4, or 5 is kept as is, and 0s are 0s.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 1s, 6s, and 8s. The output keeps them as is, except 8s are kept as 8s, 6s are kept as 6s, and 1s are kept as 1s. So the rule holds.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 1s, 7s, and 6s. The output keeps them as is, except 1s remain 1s, 7s remain 7s, and 6s remain 6s. So the rule holds.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 3s, 0s, and 8s. The output keeps them as is, except 8s are replaced with 2s, 2s are kept as 2s, and 3s remain 3s. So the rule is: any 8 is replaced with 2, and any 2 is kept as 2. All other numbers are set to 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 4s are kept as 4s. So the rule isn't just replacing 8s with 2s and 2s with 2s. It's also keeping 4s as 4s, 5s as 5s, and 0s as 0s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: any number that is 0, 1, 2, 3 is set to 0, any 4, 5, 6, 7 is kept as is, and 8 is set to 8.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 4s and 5s are kept as they are, so that fits. In Example 2, the 8s are kept as 8s, 6s as 6s, and 1s as 1s. In Example 3, the 1s remain 1s, 7s remain 7s, and 6s remain 6s. In Example 4, the 8s are replaced with 2s, 2s remain 2s, and 3s remain 3s. 0s and 1s, 2s, 4s are set to 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 4s are kept as 4s, so the rule can't be just setting numbers below 4 to 0. It also keeps 4s and 5s as they are. So the rule is: 0s stay 0, 1s stay 1, 2s stay 2, 3s stay 3, 4s stay 4, 5s stay 5, 6s stay 6, 7s stay 7, and 8s stay 8.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 5s are kept as 5s, so that fits. But in Example 2, the 8s are kept as 8s, which fits. In Example 3, the 7s are kept as 7s, which fits. In Example 4, the 8s are replaced with 2s, which fits.\n\nSo the rule is: any number in the input is kept as it is in the output. So the rule is simply that the numbers are not modified; they are the same as in the input. \n\nBut that can't be, because the examples show that in some cases, the numbers are transformed. For example, in Example 2, the input has a 1, which is kept as 1; a 6, kept as 6; an 8, kept as 8; and zeros are zeros. So the rule is that the numbers are not modified; they are the same as in the input.\n\nBut that doesn't explain why in Example 1, the 4s are kept as 4s. Wait, no, in Example 1, the 4s are kept as 4s, so the rule is that numbers are not modified. \n\nWait, but in Example 4, the 8s are replaced with 2s, which suggests that the rule is different. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nWait, let me look at Example 4 again. The input has 8s and 3s. The output keeps them as 8s and 3s. But in the output, some 8s are replaced with 2s. Wait, no, in the output, the 8s are in the third row and are 2s. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, looking at Example 4's output, the third row has 2s, which are in the fourth column. So it seems that 8s are being replaced with 2s. So the rule is: any 8 in the input is replaced with 2, and any 2 is kept as 2, while all other numbers are set to 0.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 8s are kept as 8s, so that contradicts the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that 0s are 0s, 1s are 1s, 2s are 0s, 3s are 0s, 4s are 0s, 5s are 5s, 6s are 6s, 7s are 0s, and 8s are 8s. But then in Example 1, the 4s and 5s are kept as they are, which fits. \n\nBut in Example 4, the 8s are replaced with 2s, which fits. So maybe the rule is: any 8 is replaced with 2, any 2 is kept as 2, and other numbers are set to 0.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The input has 8s, 4s, and 5s. According to the rule, the 8s are replaced with 2s, the 4s remain 4s, the 5s remain 5s, and 0s remain 0s. So the output would have 2s where 8s were, 4s as 4s, and 5s as 5s. \n\nBut in Example 1's output, the 8s are 8s, which doesn't fit this rule. So this can't be the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the numbers are only modified if they are 8 or 6, and kept otherwise. But then in Example 1, the 4s and 5s are kept as they are. \n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 1s in the third row, and the output has 1s in the first, second, and third rows. So the 1s are retained. The 7s in the input are kept as 7s, and 6s remain 6s. The 0s remain 0s. So the rule is that 0s, 1s, 6s, and 7s are retained, and 4s, 5s, and 8s are set to 0. \n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 8s are kept as 8s, so that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any number greater than 4 is set to 8, and 8 is kept as 8. Numbers less than or equal to 4 are set to 0, except 5, which is kept as 5. But then in Example 1, the third row has 5s, which are kept as 5s, which fits. The 8s are kept as 8s, which fits. 4s are set to 0, but in Example 1, the 4s are kept as 4s, which contradicts this rule.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to look for a pattern in the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s, 4s, and 5s. The output has 8s as 8s, 4s as 4s, 5s as 5s. So the rule is that any 8 is kept as 8, 4s are kept as 4s, 5s are kept as 5s, and 0s are 0s.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 8s, 6s, and 1s. The output keeps them as is, so 8s are 8s, 6s are 6s, 1s are 1s, and 0s are 0s.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are four examples provided, so I'll start by analyzing those to figure out what the rule might be.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a grid with mostly zeros and a few 4s and 8s. The output seems to have the same structure but with all the 4s turned into 8s. So, maybe the rule is that wherever there's a 4 in the input, it becomes an 8 in the output. But I should check the other examples to make sure this isn't just a coincidence.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has some 6s and 1s in the third row, and the output seems to have those converted. For instance, the third row of the input has three 6s, and in the output, those same positions are also 6s. Wait, but looking closer, the 6s are unchanged, but the 1s elsewhere are turned into 6s. So maybe the rule isn't just about converting 4s to 8s, but perhaps there's a more complex transformation happening.\n\nWait, no, in Example 2, the output seems to have a different structure. The first few rows are the same as the input, but then there's a row where the 1s in the third column are turned into 6s. This suggests that perhaps the rule is about converting 1s to 6s and 4s to 8s, but I need to verify this with the other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 7 in certain positions, and the output has 7s and 1s. The output seems to keep the 7s as they are and only change the 1s in the input to 7s. So, the rule here is that any 1 in the input becomes a 7 in the output, but other numbers remain the same.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 2s and 3s in the upper rows, and the output seems to replace them with 2s or 6s. Specifically, the 2s in the first few rows stay the same, but in the last row, the 2s are converted to 2s again, but wait, the output shows 2s in the last row, same as the input. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in Example 4, the input has 2s and 3s, and the output seems to have 2s and 6s. So perhaps the rule is that any 2 in the input remains a 2, and any 3 becomes a 6. Also, the 7s become 7s as in Example 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule seems to be:\n\n- 1s in the input are converted to 7s in the output.\n- 4s in the input are converted to 8s in the output.\n- 2s and 3s are converted to 2s and 6s, respectively.\n- All other numbers remain unchanged.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid provided, let's go through each row and apply the transformations.\n\nFirst row: 0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 8 8 0 0\nSecond row: 0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 8 8 0 0\nThird row: 5 5 4 4 5 5 \u2192 5 5 8 8 5 5\nFourth row: 5 5 4 4 5 5 \u2192 5 5 8 8 5 5\nFifth row: 0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 8 8 0 0\nSixth row: 0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 8 8 0 0\nSeventh row: 0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 8 8 0 0\nEighth row: 0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 8 8 0 0\nNinth row: 0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 8 8 0 0\nTenth row: 0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 8 8 0 0\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 4s became 8s, which fits. But in the test input, in the output, the 8s are in the same positions as the input's 4s, but according to the examples, the output for the test input is given as:\n\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent because in the test input, the third row has 0 0 4 4 0 0, which should become 0 0 8 8 0 0, but in the output, it's 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which doesn't match. Maybe I misunderstood the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Example 1, the 4s become 8s, but in the test input, the 4s are in multiple places. Wait, looking back at Example 1, the input has 0s and 4s, and the output has 0s and 8s in the same positions. So, perhaps the rule is that any 4 becomes 8, and 1 becomes 7, and 2 becomes 2, 3 becomes 6, etc.\n\nBut in the test input, the 4s are in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth rows, so they should turn into 8s. However, in the output given, many rows have 0s in the first three and last three positions. That suggests that perhaps the 4s and 1s are being converted to 8s and 7s, but other numbers are left as is.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that all 1s become 7s, all 4s become 8s, and other numbers remain the same. Let me test this with the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n- 4s become 8s.\n- 1s become 7s. But in the test input, there are no 1s, so no change.\n- 5s remain 5s.\n- 0s remain 0s.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n5 5 8 8 5 5\n5 5 8 8 5 5\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n\nBut according to Example 1, the 4s turn into 8s, which matches this. Also, in Example 2, the 1s in the third row become 6s, but in the test input, there are no 1s, so that doesn't apply.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has 1s in the third row, and the output converts them to 6s. But in the test input, there are no 1s, so the rule about 1s and 7s doesn't apply here.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be:\n\n- Any 1 in the input becomes a 7 in the output.\n- Any 4 in the input becomes an 8 in the output.\n- Any 2 in the input becomes a 2 in the output.\n- Any 3 in the input becomes a 6 in the output.\n- All other numbers remain unchanged.\n\nLet me test this with Example 4:\n\nInput:\n\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, in the output, the 2s remain as 2s, and the 3s become 6s. So, according to the rule, 3s become 6s, which matches the output. So, the rule seems to hold.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- 4s become 8s.\n- 1s become 7s. No 1s here.\n- 5s remain 5s.\n- 0s remain 0s.\n- 2s remain 2s.\n- 3s become 6s. No 3s here.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n5 5 8 8 5 5\n5 5 8 8 5 5\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n\nBut wait, in the test input, the 5s are in the third, fourth, fifteenth, and sixteenth rows. In the output, these 5s remain the same, which is correct.\n\nSo, that should be the output for the test input.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Looking at the examples provided, I'll start by comparing a few cells from the input and output to see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn the first example, the input grid has some zeros and some numbers like 4 and 8. The output grid seems to have more zeros and 8s where the input had 4s, but there's also some 3s in the third example. That might mean the rule isn't just a simple transformation of the numbers themselves.\n\nLooking closer, in example 1, the input has 0s and 8s, and the output has 0s and 8s in the same positions. Wait, but in example 3, the input has 1s and 8s, and the output shows some 1s and 8s as well, which suggests that the rule involves both the positions and the values.\n\nAnother observation is that in some rows of the input, there are 4s and 8s, and in the output, those values translate to 0s and 8s. For example, the cell with 4 becomes 0 in the output, and 8 remains 8. Similarly, 5 becomes 3, which affects certain cells.\n\nWait, in example 1, I notice that in the first few rows, there are 0s and 4s, and the output retains those 0s but changes the 4s to 8s. However, in the later rows of example 1, there are 5s and 8s, which in the output become 3s and 3s. This suggests that the rule involves a change based on the cell's value, not just a straightforward transformation.\n\nAnother point is that in example 3, the 1s turn into 3s, and the 8s remain 8s. This indicates that the rule might involve a subtraction or transformation of the cell's value based on its position or value.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that the rule is as follows: for each cell, if the value is greater than 5, it's replaced by 3, otherwise, it remains the same. However, in the output grid, the 8s are retained, and the 4s are turned into 3s in some rows, which matches this idea.\n\nWait, but in example 1, the 8s in the input remain 8s in the output, which suggests that the rule only applies to values less than or equal to 5. So, any cell with a value of 5 or below is replaced by 3 if it's greater than 5, otherwise, it stays the same. But in example 1, the 8s stay 8, so that makes sense.\n\nIn example 2, the 6s become 6s, which aligns with the rule that 6 is greater than 5 and remains unchanged. The 1s and 7s in example 3 are transformed into 3s, which matches the rule of 3 when the value is greater than 5.\n\nLooking at example 4, the 3s become 2s, which again follows the rule that 3 is transformed into 2. The 0s remain 0s, and the 8s stay 8s.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: for each cell, if the value is greater than 5, replace it with 3; otherwise, leave it as is. This applies consistently across all examples.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid provided:\n\nInput:\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nApplying the rule, each 4 becomes 3, each 5 becomes 3, and all other values (like 0s and 8s) remain the same. Therefore, the output grid should have 3s in place of 4s and 5s, and 0s and 8s unchanged.\n\nSo, the test output grid would be:\n\n0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 3 3 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 3 3 0 0\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Okay, so I have to figure out the common rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's start by analyzing each example to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has some zeros and some numbers like 8, 4, 5, etc. In the output, most of the zeros are replaced by the surrounding numbers, but the corners are reduced to zero. It seems like the rule might be about taking the maximum value in the surrounding area, but I need to check more examples.\n\nNow, looking at Example 2, I notice that the number 6 is being preserved in some parts of the grid. For instance, in the third row, the middle two elements are still 6. This suggests that 6 is a special value that stays the same when it's in the center of a 3x3 area. So when the grid has 6, whatever the surrounding max is, it remains 6 until changed.\n\nMoving on to Example 3, the number 7 is preserved around the edges. For example, the first row has 7, 7, 1, but the 1 is in the middle, so it's preserved. This indicates that when 7 is on the edge, it stays there, but when it's in the center, it takes the maximum of its neighbors.\n\nIn Example 4, the center is being reduced to 2s, which are the max of the surrounding 4 or 5s. The corners are also 2s, which are the max of their surrounding 4s. This aligns with the idea that the rule depends on the grid size and the positions of the numbers.\n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be that each cell in the output is the maximum value of the corresponding 3x3 area in the input grid. However, for cells on the edges of the grid, if the input has a number, it's preserved in the output, and the max rule only applies to the inner 5x5 area.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each cell in the output grid, if the cell is not on the edge, the output cell is the maximum of the 3x3 area centered on it in the input grid. If the cell is on the edge, the output cell is the input cell itself unless it's 0, in which case it remains 0.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 4s and 5s are being replaced by the surrounding max, but the 8s stay. Maybe 8 is a special value that's preserved, but in other cases, it's replaced by the max. I need to confirm this.\n\nIn Example 2, the 6s are preserved, even though they are in the center of a 3x3 area. So perhaps when the input is 6, the output remains 6, regardless of the surrounding max. This means that in the rule, if the cell's value is 6, it's kept as is; otherwise, it's replaced by the max.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the 7s are preserved, so when the cell is 7, it's kept; otherwise, it's replaced by the max.\n\nIn Example 4, the 2s are preserved, so when the cell is 2, it's kept; otherwise, it's replaced by the max.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each cell, if the input value is 6, 7, or 2, the output is the input value. Otherwise, the output is the maximum value in the 3x3 area centered on that cell. If the cell is on the edge of the grid, the output is determined by the surrounding area, but if the maximum is 0, it remains 0.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 8s are preserved, so if the input is 8, it's kept; otherwise, it's replaced by the max.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule is:\n\n- For each cell (i, j):\n  - If the input value at (i, j) is 6, 7, or 2, output the same value.\n  - Else, output the maximum value in the 3x3 area centered at (i, j), considering the boundaries of the grid.\n  - If the maximum value is 0, output 0; otherwise, output the maximum value.\n\nThis explains why in Example 1, the 8s are preserved, and in other examples, numbers like 4, 5, 6, 7 are being replaced by their surrounding max.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples given show how the input transforms into the output, and I need to figure out what that rule is so I can apply it to a test input grid. \n\nLooking at the first example, the input is a 15-row grid with numbers ranging from 0 to 8, and the output starts with the same numbers but then changes some 8s to 3s and some 3s to 8s. The rule seems to involve some kind of transformation based on the values in the input.\n\nIn the second example, the input has a mix of 0s, 6s, and 1s. The output changes the 6s to 8s, but also affects the 3s in the third example, turning them into 6s. The last example shows that 0s and 4s are transformed in a similar way, changing them to 3s or 8s based on their position.\n\nI think the rule might be related to the minimum values in the 2x2 subgrids of the input. For instance, if a 2x2 subgrid has a minimum value, that value might be placed in the corresponding cell in the output. But I need to test this hypothesis.\n\nLet me consider the first example again. The input has some 8s and 0s, and the output changes some of them to 3s and 8s. If I look at a 2x2 grid in the input where the minimum is 0, it would stay 0, but if it's 3, it would become 3. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit because in the output, both 0 and 3s are changing. Maybe the rule is that each cell is replaced by the minimum of its 2x2 neighborhood in the input.\n\nLet me test this with the first example. For each cell in the output, it's the minimum of the 2x2 area around it in the input. For instance, the first cell (0,0) in the input is 0, and its minimum in the 2x2 area is 0, so it stays 0. The cell (0,1) is 0, and its minimum is 0, so it's 0. The cell (0,2) is 4, and in its 2x2 area, the minimum might be 0, but in the output, it's still 4, so that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the third example where the output changes 1s to 6s and 6s to 8s. The input has 1s and 6s, and the output shows 6s and 8s. It seems like replacing 1s with 6s and 6s with 8s based on some condition.\n\nWait, in the third example, the output shows 6s replacing 1s, but also 8s replacing 3s. So maybe the rule is that each 1 in the input is replaced by 6, each 3 is replaced by 8, and 6 remains 6. But looking at the output, the 6s stay as 6s, which matches, and the 8s are replacing the 3s and 1s. So perhaps the rule is to replace 1s with 6, 3s with 8, and leave others as they are.\n\nTesting this with the first example, the 1s are in certain positions. For example, in the input, I don't see any 1s, so the output remains the same. In the second example, the input has 6s and 1s, and the output changes 1s to 6s and 6s to 8s. This supports the rule.\n\nIn the fourth example, the input has 0s, 3s, and 4s, and the output changes 0s and 4s to 3s and some 4s to 8s. This again aligns with the rule that 1s become 6s, 3s become 8s, and others remain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule is that each 1 in the input is replaced by 6, each 3 is replaced by 8, and all other numbers remain unchanged. This seems to fit all the provided examples.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me look at the examples carefully to deduce the pattern.\n\nFirst, I'll examine Example 1. The input has some 0s and 8s with a lot of 0s, and the output seems to have mostly 0s and some 8s in the same positions. The 8s stay where they are, which might mean they are part of the output. Let me look at the positions where 8s appear in both input and output.\n\nIn Input 1, the last three rows have 8s in specific columns. For example, in row 3, column 3, and row 6, column 3. But in the output, these 8s remain the same. Hmm, so maybe the 8s are not being changed. But where else do 8s appear? In the input, they are in positions where the input has 8, but in the output, they stay. Wait, perhaps the 8s are being preserved, and 0s are being converted to something else.\n\nLooking at Input 2, the output has 0s in some places and 1s in others. Let me check where the 0s and 1s are. For instance, in Output 2, the first few rows have 0s, and then some rows have 1s. Wait, the first few rows in Input 2 are all 0s except for a few 6s. But in Output 2, those 0s are replaced with 0s, so maybe the 6s are being changed.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a lot of 0s and a few 1s, and the output has some 1s and a few 0s. The 1s in the output seem to be in positions where the input had 1s, but the 0s are also being changed. For instance, in Output 3, the first few rows have 0s, and some have 1s. The initial 0s are kept, but the later ones are transformed.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 0s, 3s, and 4s, and the output has 0s, 3s, and 2s. The 4s in the input are transformed into 2s in the output. So it looks like when a cell has a 4, it becomes a 2 in the output.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that the rule is:\n\n- If a cell in the input has a 0, it remains 0 in the output.\n- If a cell has a 8, it remains 8.\n- If a cell has a 4, it becomes 2.\n- All other cells (like 6, 5, 7, etc.) remain the same as their value.\n\nLet me verify this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 0s and 8s, and the output has 0s and 8s in the same positions. The 8s are preserved, so this supports the rule. The 0s might be being converted to 0s, but I don't see a 4 being converted, so perhaps they are not involved.\n\nIn Example 2, the initial 0s and 6s remain 0s, but the 6s are being converted to 1s in the output. Wait, this contradicts my earlier thought because 6s are not 4s. Let me check the input and output again.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has 6s, and the output has 1s. So perhaps when a cell has a 6, it becomes a 1. Let me see if this fits with other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s, and the output has 8s. So 8 remains 8.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 1s, and the output has 1s. So 1 remains 1.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 4s, and the output has 2s. So 4 becomes 2.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n\n- 0 remains 0.\n- 8 remains 8.\n- 4 becomes 2.\n- All other cells (like 6, 5, 7, etc.) remain the same.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid to generate the output.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nNow, applying the rule:\n\n- 0s remain 0.\n- 8s remain 8 (but there are no 8s in the input).\n- 4s become 2s.\n- All other cells remain the same.\n\nSo, the output grid will have 0s where the input was 0, 2s where the input had 4, and the same values elsewhere.\n\nLet me apply this to each row:\n\nRow 1:\n0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 2:\n0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 3:\n5 5 4 4 5 5 \u2192 5 5 2 2 5 5\n\nRow 4:\n5 5 4 4 5 5 \u2192 5 5 2 2 5 5\n\nRow 5:\n0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 6:\n0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 7:\n0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 8:\n0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 9:\n0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 10:\n0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 11:\n0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 12:\n0 0 4 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\nWait, but in the test input, the last few rows are:\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nSo applying the rule, they become 0 0 2 2 0 0 four times.\n\nBut in the test output, I'm not sure what the expected result is, but I think applying the rule as described should work.\n</think>", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 6 6 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n7 7 1 7 7 7 7\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 3 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me look at the examples provided to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a bunch of zeros and some 8s and 4s. The output seems to have the same pattern but with the 4s replaced by 8s in the rows that have the 8s. Hmm, maybe the rule is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a row with 1s and 6s. The output shows the 1s turned into 1s, but the 6s are still there. Wait, no, the output for that row is 1s in the middle. Maybe it's about replacing 6s with 1s in certain positions.\n\nExample 3 shows that 7s are replaced with 1s in specific positions. The input has 7s in one row, and the output has 1s there. So, the rule could be to change 7s and 6s into 1s, but only in specific cells.\n\nLooking back at Example 2, the input has a 6 in the first and last columns. The output for those columns still has 6s. The middle has 1s. So maybe the rule is to change 6s into 1s in the middle column. But why does the input have 6s in the first and last columns? That might be a different rule.\n\nMaybe the rule isn't about the entire grid but specific parts. Let's see: In Example 3, the 7s are changed to 1s in the middle row. In Example 1, the 4s are changed to 8s in the middle row. Example 2 changes 1s to 1s and 6s to 1s in the middle column. Example 4 changes 2s to 2s and 3s to 1s in certain positions.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule seems to be that in the middle row of each grid, any number that is 7, 8, 9, or 6 becomes 1. But in the first example, the middle row has 8s, which remain 8, so maybe it's only 6, 7, or 9 that become 1. Let me check the other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the first and last columns still have their original numbers, so perhaps the rule applies to the middle column. In Example 3, the middle row's 7s are in the middle, so maybe the rule is about the middle row specifically. \n\nWait, let me think again. In Example 4, the middle row has 2s, which remain 2s, so maybe the rule only changes numbers greater than or equal to 6. But in Example 3, the 7s become 1s, which aligns with that idea.\n\nSo the general rule is: In the middle row (assuming it's the fourth row in all examples), any number that is 6, 7, or 8 becomes 1. Other numbers remain the same. For the other rows, the numbers might remain the same unless there's a specific rule.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the middle row has 8s, which stay 8s, so the rule is only for 6,7,8 and 9? Or maybe it's only 6,7,8. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn Example 2, the 6s in the first and last columns are preserved, so the rule likely affects the middle column. In Example 3, the 7s are changed to 1s in the middle row, which supports the rule that 7s, 6s, and 8s become 1s.\n\nSo the rule is: In the middle row of each grid, every 6, 7, or 8 becomes a 1, and all other numbers remain the same. The other rows and columns remain unchanged.\n\nLet me apply this rule to the test input grid provided:\n\nInput:\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n5 5 4 4 5 5\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Rows 1 to 3 have 4s and 5s.\n- Rows 4 to 9 have 5s and 4s.\n- Row 10 has 0s and 4s.\n\nIn the middle row (row 5), the values are 5 5 4 4 5 5. According to the rule, any 6,7,8 becomes 1. Here, there are no 6s,7s,8s, so they remain as is. So the output row 5 would be the same.\n\nI think that's the rule. So each row is processed independently, and the middle row has the transformation applied.\n</think>", 0.0]]}
