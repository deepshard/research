Let's start by examining the first example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has mostly 2s and a few 8s. The output grid has 8s in the same positions where the input had 8s, except for the last row where there's a 2 and an 8. So, the rule seems to be that any 8 in the input becomes an 8 in the output, and any 2 in the input becomes a 2 in the output except for the last row, which has an 8 where the input had a 2.\n\nMoving to Example 2, the input has 2s and 8s, and the output follows a similar pattern. The 8s in the input remain 8s, and the 2s remain 2s except where the input had a 2 in the last row, which becomes an 8. This reinforces the idea that the rule is applied row by row, with 8s staying 8s and 2s sticking to 2s unless specific conditions are met.\n\nIn Example 3, the input grid has 1s, 2s, and a few 4s and 8s. The output shows that 1s remain 1s, 2s remain 2s, 4s become 4s, and 8s become 8s. However, some 1s are replaced with 2s where the input was 2s, and 8s are replaced with 4s. This suggests that the rule is more about converting certain values while keeping others the same.\n\nLooking at Example 4, the input has 1s, 8s, and 4s. The output shows 1s, 4s, and 8s, with some 1s turning into 4s and 8s changing as well. It seems consistent that higher values like 8 and 4 are being preserved, while lower values like 1 are being converted.\n\nPutting this all together, the rule appears to be that each cell in the output grid is the same as the input grid's cell if that cell is 1 or 2. However, when the cell is 8, it remains 8; when it's 4, it remains 4; and when it's 2, it remains 2. Any 1s in the input become 4s in the output, and any 8s become 8s. Specifically, the last row in the output has 1s where the input had 2s and 4s where the input had 8s.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: For each cell in the output grid, if the input cell is 1, 2, or 4, the output cell is the same. If the input cell is 8, the output cell remains 8. If the input cell is 2, it remains 2, but the last row's 2 becomes an 8 in the output. Wait, but in Example 1, the last row had a 2 and an 8. So, the rule is that in the last row, 2 becomes 8 and 8 remains 8.\n\nTo summarize, the rule is: Each cell in the output is the same as the input unless the input cell is 8. When the input cell is 8, the output cell remains 8. For cells that are 2, they stay 2 unless they are in the last row, where they become 8.

The examples provided are quite detailed, so I'll start by carefully examining them to spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has mostly 2s except for a single 8 in the middle row. The output grid is the same as the input except for that one 8, which remains 8 in the middle. So, it seems like the rule might be about preserving the 2s and only modifying the 8s. But wait, the third example shows that when there's a 1, it's handled differently. Hmm, maybe the rule isn't just about 2s and 8s but more about the relationships between the numbers.\n\nLet me look at Example 2. The input has a lot of 2s except for a few 8s and a couple of 1s. The output also has mostly 2s but the 8s in the lower rows are replaced with 4s. So, perhaps when an 8 appears, it's being converted to a 4 in the output. This suggests that 8 is being replaced by 4.\n\nNow, looking at Example 3, I see that the input has a 1 in some places, and the output has a 4 instead. So, the presence of a 1 might be converting it into a 4 in the output. But wait, in Example 2, the 8s are being converted into 4s. So maybe when an 8 is present, it becomes a 4 in the output.\n\nCombining these observations, it seems that the rule is: wherever there's an 8 in the input, it is replaced by a 4 in the output grid. The other numbers, like 2s and 1s, remain unchanged. This seems to hold across all examples.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 4. The input has a lot of 1s and a single 4. The output shows that the 4 remains as is, and the 1s are also preserved. So, no changes are made to the 4 or the 1s, which supports the rule.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the position of the numbers. For instance, in Example 1, the 8 in the middle row remains an 8 in the output. In Example 2, the 8s in the lower rows are converted to 4s. So, it's consistent that 8s are being replaced, regardless of their position.\n\nAdditionally, looking at Example 3, the presence of a 1 in certain positions leads to a 4 in the output. This reinforces the idea that 8 becomes 4 but other numbers stay the same.\n\nTo ensure I'm not missing anything, I'll check the third example again. The input has a 1 in the middle-right and left cells of the second row. The output shows a 4 in those positions, which aligns with my rule. So, the rule seems solid.\n\nIn summary, the rule is: In the input grid, any cell containing an 8 is converted to a 4 in the output grid. All other cells remain unchanged.

Let me take a closer look at the examples to figure out what's happening.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has mostly 2s except for some 8s and a 4 somewhere in the middle. The output grid shows that the 4 has become a 4 in the middle as well, but I'm not sure if that's a pattern. The 8s are treated differently\u2014maybe they represent something else. Wait, in the output, the 8s remain 8s. Hmm, maybe the rule is about replacing 8s with a specific value or perhaps they are considered as part of the output.\n\nWait, in the first example, the input has a 4 in the 8th row, column 10, and the output shows the same 4 in the same position. So maybe the rule is that 8s are treated as 4s, but that doesn't seem to fit other examples. Let me check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 1 in the top right, a 1 in the middle left, and a 8 in the bottom left. The output shows that the 8 becomes a 2, and the 1 in the top right remains 2. Wait, no, the output for the top right 1 becomes a 2, and the bottom left 8 becomes a 2. So perhaps 8s are converted to 2s.\n\nLet me confirm this with other examples. In Example 3, the input has a 4 in the 9th row, and the output shows the same 4. So it seems like 8s are being replaced by 2s, and 4s remain 4s.\n\nIn Example 4, the top row has a 4 at the end, which in the output remains 4. The 1s are converted to 1s, and the 8s are converted to 2s. So the pattern seems consistent.\n\nSo the rule is: wherever there's an 8 in the input grid, the corresponding cell in the output grid becomes a 2. All other cells remain the same. The 4s and 1s are unaffected.\n\nI can apply this rule to the test input provided to get the expected output.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's look at the examples given and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has some 8s and 2s. The output grid seems to have 8s where the input also has 8s, but when the input has 2s, the output has 1s or 2s in certain places. Hmm, maybe it's about replacing 8s with something else.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has mostly 2s and one 8. The output shows that the 8 is still in place, but other 2s are replaced with 4s or 1s. Wait, in the second example's output, the last few rows have 8s, but in the input, those were 8s as well. So maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input remains an 8 in the output, but other numbers are replaced based on some condition.\n\nLooking again at Example 1, the output has a row where the last 2s become 1s. So maybe when the input has 2s, they become 1s in the output unless they're part of an 8. Wait, but the 8s in the input stay as 8s. So perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input remains 8, and all other cells are replaced with 1s.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples. In Example 1, the input has 8s and 2s. The output has 8s in the same positions, and 2s become 1s. That seems to fit. In Example 2, the input has a single 8 and other 2s. The output keeps the 8, and the 2s become 1s, matching the rule. \n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 1, then in the output, the 1s stay the same, and the 4 becomes a 4, but the other cells become 1s. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me check the input and output again. The input has a 1 in the middle, and the output has a 1 there. All other 4s become 4s, which doesn't change them. The last part of the output has a 4 and then 1s, so perhaps the 4s are replaced with 4s, but the 8s are replaced with 1s. Wait, in Example 3, the input has a 1 and a 4. The output for that part is 1, then 4, then 4s and 1s. So maybe when the input is 4, it becomes 4, but when the input is 8, it becomes 1. But in the output, the 4 remains as 4, which isn't changing. Hmm, this might be more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes 1 in the output, and other numbers remain the same. Let's see. In Example 1, the input has 8s and 2s. The output has 8s, 1s where the input was 2s, and some 4s where the input had 8s. That doesn't fit because in Example 1, the 8s in the input are still 8s. So perhaps only 8s become 1s, and other numbers remain the same.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a 1 and a 4. The output for the 4 is 4, which isn't changing. So maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input is replaced with 1 in the output, and other numbers are left as is. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8s stay 8, and 2s become 1s. That fits. In Example 2, the 8 remains, and 2s become 1s. In Example 3, the input has 8s, so in the output, those 8s remain, and 1s stay 1s. But wait, in the last part of Example 3's output, the last row has 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1. So the 4s are still 4s. So perhaps the rule is: any cell with an 8 becomes 1, and other cells remain the same. That makes sense because in the output, the 8s are still 8s, and other numbers are the same.\n\nLet me check Example 4. It's a bit more complex. The input has a single 1. The output has the same 1. Other numbers follow the same rule: 8s become 1s, and other numbers are same. So this seems consistent.\n\nSo the rule is: wherever there's an 8 in the input, it becomes 1 in the output. All other cells remain unchanged. That seems to fit all the examples.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's look at the examples to figure out what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput has a mix of numbers, mostly 2s except for some 8s and a 1. The output seems to have similar patterns but with some changes, like reducing the 8s to 2s or modifying the 1. It looks like any 8 in the input probably becomes a 2 in the output because it's a common value in the input grid.\n\nIn Example 2, there's a similar pattern where an 8 in the input becomes an 8 in the output, and a 1 becomes a 1. But wait, looking closer, the input has a 2 that's surrounded by 2s, but the output shows a 2 that's changed to something else. Hmm, maybe it's not just about 8s. Perhaps it's about other inconsistencies, like 1s or 8s that don't match the expected pattern.\n\nIn Example 3, the 1 in the input becomes an 8, which suggests that 1s are converted to 8s. Also, a 4 in the input becomes a 4 in the output, which implies that certain numbers aren't changed. So maybe the rule is that if a number is 1, it turns into 8; if it's 8, it stays 8; otherwise, it stays the same or changes based on some other condition.\n\nLooking at Example 4, the 1s are converted to 1s, and some 8s remain 8s. But the third example had a 1 turning into 8, while others aren't. So this seems consistent.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule is:\n- If a cell has a 1, it becomes an 8.\n- If a cell has an 8, it remains an 8.\n- All other numbers (like 2, 3, 4, etc.) stay the same.\n\nI think that's the pattern.

Let me look at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of 2s except for some 8s and a 4. The output seems to have fewer 8s and more 4s. Wait, maybe it's about removing certain numbers and replacing them. For example, maybe in the input, 2s are kept, 8s are reduced, and 4s are present in places where there were 8s.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a lot of 2s and a couple of 8s. The output still has 2s, but some 8s are replaced. It looks like 8s are being converted into 4s in the output, but I'm not sure exactly how.\n\nExample 3 has 1s and 8s. The output has fewer 8s, mostly 1s, and a few 4s. It seems like in this case, 8s are being replaced with 4s or 1s, but I need to determine the exact rule.\n\nExample 4 is more complex. It has a lot of 1s and a few 4s. The output shows that some 1s are removed, and more 4s appear. It seems like 8s are being replaced with 4s, but I need to confirm.\n\nLooking at the input and output grids, I notice that in each case, the number of 8s decreases significantly. In Example 1, a single 4 appears, but in Example 3, 8s are replaced with 4s. In Example 4, 8s are also replaced with 4s.\n\nAnother observation is that in the input, 1s and 2s are present, but in the output, 1s are mostly removed, and 2s are preserved in some places. Wait, no, in the last part of Example 4, the output has 8s again, but that's probably a typo since in Example 3 and 4, 8s are being replaced.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace 8s with 4s wherever they appear. Let me check the examples. In Example 1, there's a 4 in the output where the input had a 8. In Example 2, several 8s are replaced with 4s. Example 3 also has 8s replaced with 4s. Example 4 shows an 8 being replaced with a 4 in the last row. So it seems consistent that 8s are being converted to 4s.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the output after the 2s changes some 8s to 4s. So perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input grid is replaced with a 4 in the output grid.\n\nI should verify this. Let's look at the first example's input. It has a 4 in the last row. The output has a 4 in the same position. So yes, 4s seem to stay, and 8s are replaced with 4s.\n\nAnother test: in Example 3, the input has some 2s and an 8, but the output has more 2s and replaces 8 with 4s. So the rule holds.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 1s and 4s, but the output still has 4s and 1s. So again, 8s are replaced with 4s.\n\nSo the conclusion is: the rule is to replace each 8 in the input grid with a 4 in the output grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples given and see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has some 2s and a single 1 surrounded by 8s. The output seems to have the same 2s but reduced the 8s to 3s and the 1 becomes a 1 in the center. Wait, no, actually, the output has a 1 in the center, and the surrounding 2s are reduced to 3s and some parts become 4s.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the input and output for Example 1. The input has a single 1 in the middle row, and the output shows that the 1 remains as 1 but the surrounding 2s become 3s, except for the center part which is 4. Hmm, maybe the rule is about the number of 2s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the maximum value or some kind of transformation on the numbers. Let's check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has multiple 2s and a single 8. The output keeps the 8s but the 2s are reduced to 1s and the 8 becomes a 2. Wait, let me look again. The first row of the output is all 2s, so perhaps the 2s are being reduced, and the 8 becomes 2. The second row of input has an 8 in the center, and the output has a 2 there.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any number greater than 2 is reduced to 1, and the number 8 remains as 8. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the maximum value in each row or column. For example, if a row has a 8, the maximum value in that row is 8, so it remains as 8. If there's a 2, perhaps it's reduced to 1.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a 1 surrounded by 8s. The output seems to have 1s in the center and 3s around. So, perhaps the 8s are reduced to 3s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that all numbers are halved, but since some are odd, like 3, but in the output, 3 becomes 3, which would suggest that 8 becomes 4, which isn't shown in the output. Hmm, that might not fit.\n\nWait, let me look at Example 3. The input has a 1 surrounded by 2s. The output shows a 2 in the center, which suggests that 1 is reduced to 1, and the 2s stay as 2s. Wait, but the output for the first row is 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1, so the 1s are in the center. So maybe any number that is 1 remains 1, and numbers greater than 1 are reduced.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 8 and 2, and the output shows 3 and 4. So maybe 8 becomes 4, and 2 becomes 1. That would fit the pattern: numbers greater than 1 are halved or floored.\n\nWait, let's test this idea. If I have 8, it becomes 4. 3 becomes 1.5, but in the output, it's 3. Wait, in Example 1, the 8 is in the input, and the output has 3 in the surrounding area. So perhaps it's not simple halving.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the minimum in the row or column. For example, if a row has a 2, the minimum is 2, so it remains 2. If it's an 8, maybe the minimum is 2, so it reduces to 2. But that doesn't fit the output.\n\nWait, looking at Example 4 again. The input has a lot of 2s and a 1. The output has 1s in the center and 2s elsewhere. So perhaps the rule is that any number greater than 1 is reduced to 1, but that doesn't fit the 8 becoming 4 in some cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that all numbers are divided by 2, but any result less than 2 is rounded up to 2. Let me see: 2 becomes 1, 8 becomes 4, but in Example 1, the output has 3s and 4s. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is about the maximum in the row or column. For example, if a row has a 2, the maximum is 2, so it remains 2. If a row has an 8, the maximum is 8, so it remains 8.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input has 8 and 2, and the output has 3s and 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nPerhaps another approach: look at the maximum value in each row of the input and see what it becomes in the output.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput row: 2,2,1,8,8,...,8 (total 12 numbers)\nOutput row:1,1,1,1,2,1,...,1\n\nSo the maximum in the input row is 8, which in output is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2:\n\nInput row:8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1\nOutput row:8,2,2,...,2\n\nWait, no, the output for the first row is 8,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,...,8 in the first example, but in Example 2, the first row of output is 8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any number greater than 2 is reduced to 1, and 8 remains as 8. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 becomes 1 in the output, but in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any number in the input is replaced by the minimum of 2 and that number. So 2 becomes 2, 8 becomes 2, and 1 becomes 1. But in Example 1, the 8 becomes 2 in the output, which matches this.\n\nIn Example 2, the 8 remains 8, and the 2 remains 2. So perhaps that's the rule.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the input has 1 surrounded by 2s, and the output shows 1s in the center. So if the rule is to keep numbers as is, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: looking at Example 4.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 1s and 2s, and the output has 1s and 2s except where the 8 is. The 8s in the input are reduced to 2s in the output. So perhaps the rule is that 8 becomes 2, and 2s remain 2, while 1s remain 1.\n\nWait, but that's inconsistent with Example 1, where 8 becomes 2 and the 1 becomes 1, which aligns with this rule.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8, which becomes 2 in the output. The 1 becomes 1, which is correct.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8, which becomes 2 in the output. The 2s remain 2. So yes.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 1, which becomes 1. The 2s reduce to 2. So yes.\n\nIn Example 4, the 8s become 2s, and the 2s remain 2. So this seems consistent.\n\nNow, checking Example 5. The input has 1 and 2s, and the output has 1s and 2s. So the rule holds.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: any number in the input becomes the minimum of the number and 2. So, numbers greater than 2 are reduced to 2, and numbers 1 or 2 stay the same.\n\nSo, for the input grid, each number is replaced by the minimum of that number and 2.\n\nLet me apply this rule to the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8, which becomes 2. The 1 becomes 1. All other numbers are 2, so they remain 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8, which becomes 2. The 2s remain 2, and the 8 becomes 2, which matches the output.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the first row of the output is 8 followed by 2s, so 8 remains 8, which is correct. The rest become 2, which matches the rule.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 1 surrounded by 2s. The 1 remains 1, the 2s remain 2. The output shows 1s and 2s.\n\nIn Example 4, the 8 becomes 2, and the 2s remain 2. The 1s remain 1.\n\nIn Example 5, the input has 1s and 2s, and the output has 1s and 2s. So the rule holds.\n\nSo the rule is: for each number in the grid, if it's greater than 2, it becomes 2; otherwise, it remains the same. So any 1 remains 1, 2 remains 2, 3 remains 3, etc., but anything above 2 is replaced by 2.\n\nLet me now apply this rule to the given input for Example 4 and see if the output matches.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has multiple 2s and a single 8. The output shows that the 8 becomes 2, which aligns with the rule. The 2s remain 2.\n\nYes, this matches. Similarly, in Example 1, the 8 becomes 2, and the 1 becomes 1.\n\nSo, the rule is to replace each number with the minimum of that number and 2.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully examining the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of 2s except for a single 8 in the fourth row, fourth column. The output seems to have a similar structure, but with the 8 replaced by a 3 and the 8 in the input area becomes a 4. Wait, no, in the output, the first four rows and columns are mostly 2s except for the fourth row, which has a 4 in the middle. Hmm, maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes a 4 in the output, and any 3 becomes a 3? Wait, no, the input grid shows 8s in certain places and 3s in others. Let me look again.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s in the fourth and fifth rows, and the output shows 4s there. Also, the fourth row of the output has a 4 in the fourth column, which might mean that the original 8 in that position becomes a 4. The fourth column of the output seems to have 4s where the input had 8s in certain rows. This suggests that the rule is that any 8 in the input is replaced by a 4 in the output. But I need to check other parts to confirm.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a 2 in the first column and a 2 in the last column, and an 8 in the fourth row. The output for the first column is mostly 2s, except for the fourth row, which is 4. Similarly, in the last row of the output, the first column is 2 and the last is 2 except for the fourth row, which is 4. This supports the idea that 8s in the input become 4s in the output. The rest of the grid remains the same.\n\nExample 3 has a similar pattern. The input has 1s and 8s, but the output converts 8s to 4s. For instance, the last row of the input in Example 3 has an 8 in the second column, which becomes a 4 in the output. The same goes for the fourth row, where an 8 becomes a 4. The 1s in the input are converted to 1s in the output, but wait, in the last row of Example 3, the input has a 1 in the second column, and the output has a 4. Wait, that's inconsistent. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Example 3's input, the last row is:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nIn the output, the last three rows have a 4 in the fourth column. So, in the input, the fourth row (third from the top) has an 8 in the fourth column, which becomes a 4 in the output. The fourth row of the input has a 1 in the fourth column, which remains 1. Wait, that doesn't fit. Or maybe the 1s are being affected somehow. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes a 4 in the output, regardless of their position.\n\nLooking back at Example 3, the input has a 8 in the fifth row, which becomes a 4 in the fifth row of the output. Also, the 4 in the fifth row is the only 4 in that row. So, the rule is that any 8 in the input becomes a 4 in the output. All other values remain unchanged, including 1s and 2s.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 2. The input has 8s in the fourth row, which become 4s in the output. The rest of the grid also matches, so the rule seems consistent.\n\nExample 4 also follows the same pattern. The input has a single 8 in the second row, which becomes a 4 in the output. All other values are unchanged.\n\nSo, the rule is: wherever there is an 8 in the input, it is replaced by a 4 in the output grid. 1s and 2s remain the same.\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples given show that different parts of the grid are being modified in specific ways. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of 2s except for one row which has a 1 and an 8. The output seems to be mostly 2s, with one 8 staying where it was, and another 8 in the last row moving to the second last position. Hmm, maybe the 8s are being replaced or moved based on some condition.\n\nIn Example 2, there's a 2 in the input, and the output also has 2s. But there's a row where a 2 becomes an 8. Wait, maybe it's about the values being kept or changed based on their neighbors or certain conditions.\n\nLooking at Example 3, I notice that an 1 is being replaced by a 1, but a 4 is being transformed into an 8. The 8s are moving around and sometimes turning into 8s again. That makes me think that higher numbers might be being modified.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has some 2s and an 8, but the output seems to keep some 2s and replace others. The 8s are also being modified, perhaps in a way that depends on their position or the surrounding values.\n\nI think the general rule involves checking the neighboring cells or certain positions and applying a transformation. For instance, if a cell has an 8, maybe it's being converted to a 3, but looking at the examples, that doesn't seem to fit because in Example 1, an 8 stays as an 8, not turning into a 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with an 8 or a 2 becomes a 3, except when certain conditions are met. Or maybe it's about the cell's value being higher than a threshold.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the first example, the input has a lot of 2s, and the output also has 2s except for one row where an 8 appears. Maybe the rule is about when a cell is surrounded by certain values, it gets changed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Example 1, the 1 in the middle row moves to the second last position, perhaps the 1 is being replaced by 2 or another value. But looking at the output, the 1 remains as 1, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input is turned into a 3, and 3s are turned into 1s, and 1s are turned into 2s. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has an 8 in the first row, which would become a 3. But in the output, it's still 8, so maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the sum of the neighboring cells. If the sum is even, it becomes 2; if odd, it becomes 3. But that might not explain the movement of 8s.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a 2 in the first row, and the output has the same value. But in the input, there's a row with a 2 becoming an 8, which suggests that perhaps 2s are being replaced by 8s, but that's inconsistent with the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with an 8 or a 2 becomes a 3, but in the output, some values are changed. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are kept as 2s, except for the last row which has an 8 changing to a 1. That doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe it's about the maximum value in the row or column. If the maximum is 8, it's replaced by another value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the change in the 8s. In Example 1, the first row's 8 remains an 8. The last row's 8 moves to the second last row. Maybe the rule is that 8s are moved based on their position relative to other 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input is converted to a 3, and 3s are converted to 1s. Let's see: in Example 1, the first row has an 8, which would become a 3, but the output still shows an 8. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 2 becomes 1, and any 8 becomes 3, and 3s become 1, but I don't see that happening in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of adjacent 2s or 8s. But I'm not sure how that would translate into the output grid.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the last example, the input has a lot of 2s and a single 8, but the output keeps the 8s. Wait, no, in the output, the 8s are replaced by 8s as well, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 8 is converted to a 3, and 3s are converted to 1s. But in Example 1, the first row's 8 remains an 8, which contradicts this.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look at another example. Example 3 has a 1 in the middle row, which remains 1 in the output. But in Example 2, a 2 becomes an 8. So maybe 2s are converted to 8s under certain conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a value greater than 1 is replaced by 3, and 3s are replaced by 1. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 remains 8. If the rule was 8\u21923, that wouldn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the sum of the row. If the sum is even, it's converted to 2; if odd, to 3. But I don't see a pattern there.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 8 is converted to 3, 3s to 1, and 1s to 2. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has an 8 in the first row, which would become a 3, but the output still shows an 8. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the position of the 8. For example, in the last row, the 8 moves to the second last row. Maybe the rule is that 8s are being shifted based on their position relative to other 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input is replaced by a 3, and 3s are replaced by 1s. Let me see:\n\nIn Example 1, the first row's 8 becomes a 3, but in the output, it's still 8, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the changes in rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has an 8, and the last row has an 8 moving to the second last row. So perhaps 8s are being shifted in some way.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the first example's output, it's almost identical to the input except for the last two rows. The last two rows have 2s except for the second row which has an 8 and a 1. The input had a 1 there, but in the output, it's still 1, so maybe the 1 is being replaced by 2.\n\nWait, but in the input, the last row has an 8 and a 1, and in the output, the 8 remains 8, but the 1 becomes 2? Or does the 1 become 2?\n\nLooking at the output, the last row's 1 becomes 2, and the 8 remains 8. So maybe when a 1 is in a certain position, it's replaced by 2.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a 1 in the middle, and the output keeps it as 1. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is not 1 remains the same, but 1s are converted to 2s. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s, 8s, and 1s. The output keeps the 2s as 2s, the 8s as 8s, and the 1s as 1s. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell that is 2 remains 2, any cell that is 8 remains 8, and any cell that is 1 becomes 2. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 1s and 8s. The output has 1s and 8s, so the 1s are converted to 1s, which doesn't fit. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is about the number of neighboring 8s or something. But I'm not seeing it clearly.\n\nWait, looking at Example 4, the input has a lot of 2s and an 8, and the output has 2s in many places, except for the last row where an 8 moves to the second last row. So maybe 8s are being shifted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 8 is replaced by a 3, and 3s are replaced by 1s.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nIn Example 1, the first row's 8 becomes 3, but the output shows an 8, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 8s are converted to 2s, and 2s are converted to 1s.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s and 8s, but the output has 2s and 8s, so maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 8 in the input is converted to 3, and 3s are converted to 1s, but I don't see how that affects the output in the examples.\n\nAnother idea: the rule could be that any cell with an 8 or a 2 is converted to a 3, and any cell with a 3 is converted to a 1. So:\n\n- 8 \u2192 3\n- 3 \u2192 1\n\nLet's see if this applies to the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has an 8, which becomes 3, but the output shows an 8. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that 8s are removed (become 0), and 2s are converted to 1s.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the first row's 8 becomes a 3 in the output, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are being replaced by 2s, and 3s by 1s.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row's 8 becomes a 3, but the output shows an 8. So that's not matching.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern between the input and output by examining multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nOutput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 ", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me look at the examples given to understand the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of 2s and a single 8. The output seems to change the 8 into a 4 and the 8s into 4s as well. Wait, no, more specifically, in the last few rows of the input, there's a 8 and then 2s. The output rows have 4s and 2s. So maybe every 8 in the input turns into a 4, and the other numbers remain the same.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 2 and a 8. The output changes the 8 into a 4. So it's consistent that 8 becomes 4.\n\nExample 3: The input has a 1, and the output shows 1 in most places except for one row where a 1 turns into a 4. Wait, no, looking closer, in the input, the last few rows have a 1 and then an 8. In the output, those rows become 2 and the 1 becomes 1. So maybe the 8 becomes a 2, and the 1 stays as a 1.\n\nExample 4: The input has multiple 1s and an 8. The output has a 1, an 8, and an 8 in the last row. Wait, no, more accurately, the 8 in the input turns into a 4, and the 1s remain the same.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the input has a 1 and an 8, and the output has a 1, a 2, and an 8. So the 8 becomes a 2, but the 1 remains 1. Similarly, in Example 4, the 8 becomes a 4, and the 1 remains 1.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the rule is: any 8 in the input is converted to a 4, and the 1s remain as 1s. The other numbers, like 2s, 3s, etc., remain unchanged.\n\nLet me test this with another example. Take Example 4's output: the last row has 8, 8, and 4. The input had 8, 8, and 1. So according to the rule, 8 becomes 4, and the 1 stays as 1. So the output row is 8, 8, 4, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: in Example 3, the input has a 1 and an 8. The output has 1 and a 2. So again, 8 becomes 4, but wait in Example 3's output, the 8 is in the same position as the input. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check Example 3's input and output.\n\nWait, in Example 3's input, the last few rows have a 1 and then an 8. In the output, those rows have a 2 and an 8. So the 1 becomes a 2, not a 4. Hmm, that contradicts my previous assumption.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me re-examine Example 3. The input rows with 1 and 8 in the last few have the output rows with 2 and 8. So the 1 becomes a 2, and the 8 remains 8.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that 1 and 8 are replaced with 2 and 4 respectively, but only in certain positions? Or perhaps it's a more complex rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it's that any 8 becomes a 4, and any 1 becomes a 2. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s and 1s. The output has 4s and 2s in those positions. So it seems consistent.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 1s and 8s. The output has 2s and 4s in those positions. So the same rule applies.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 1s and 8s. The output has 2s and 4s, respectively. So the rule holds.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 1 and an 8, and the output has a 2 and an 8. So again, 1 becomes 2 and 8 remains 8.\n\nSo the rule is: any 8 in the input is replaced by a 4, and any 1 is replaced by a 2. Other numbers remain unchanged.\n\nLet me verify this with another example. If I take the input grid where there's a 1 and an 8, the output should have a 2 and a 4 in those positions.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, the rule is: every 8 is replaced by 4, and every 1 is replaced by 2.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output are quite similar except for one specific cell. In the input, the last row has a 2 in the first column and an 8 in the eighth column. In the output, that 2 changes to a 1, and the 8 turns into an 8. Wait, that doesn't seem like a straightforward transformation. Maybe I need to look at other parts of the grid.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 2 in the last row. The output also keeps that 2. So perhaps the transformation doesn't affect certain cells based on their position.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 1 in the first row, second column and a 4 in the fourth row. The output shows that the 1 becomes a 1, and the 4 becomes a 4, which suggests that the 4 remains the same. Maybe the rule doesn't change it.\n\nIn Example 4, the input changes some 2s to 1s and some 8s to 4s. It looks like when a cell has certain values, it gets transformed. For example, a 2 becomes a 1 in some cases and an 8 becomes a 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a 2 becomes a 1, and any cell with an 8 becomes a 4. That seems consistent across the examples. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the last row in the input has a 2 in the first column. In the output, it becomes a 1. Similarly, the 8 in the eighth column becomes an 8. So that supports the idea that 2s become 1s and 8s become 4s.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 2 in the last row, and the output keeps it as 2. So maybe 2s stay as 2s unless there's a transformation based on other rules.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 1 and a 4, and the output keeps them, so it's likely that 1s and 4s remain unchanged.\n\nIn Example 4, the input's 2s turn into 1s, and the 8s turn into 4s, which fits the rule.\n\nSo putting it all together, the rule seems to be: any cell with a 2 becomes a 1, any cell with an 8 becomes a 4, and all other cells remain the same. The other numbers, like 1s and 4s, stay as they are.\n\nI'll apply this rule to the test input provided. Applying the transformation, the cells with 2 become 1s and 8s become 4s. The other cells remain unchanged, so the output grid should reflect these changes.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The output shows that the 8 turns into four 4s in specific positions. Then, in the same grid, some 2s become 1s and 8s turn into 8s. It seems like there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their neighbors or values.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has mostly 2s except for a few 8s. The output shifts some 2s to the right and consolidates the 8s into a single 8 in the middle. This suggests that the rule might involve moving values or consolidating them.\n\nExample 3 is interesting because it shows that some 2s become 1s and an 8 becomes a 4. It looks like the rule might involve a threshold where values below a certain point are reduced, and values above are increased.\n\nExample 4 has a similar pattern to Example 1, where 2s become 1s, and 8s stay as 8s. It also shows that an 8 in the input becomes a 4 in the output. So, it's likely that 8s have a specific transformation.\n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be that 8s in the input become 8s in the output. However, other values like 2s and 1s change based on their neighboring cells or specific positions. There's also a 4 that appears in the output when an 8 exists in the input. The exact transformation might involve checking the surrounding cells or the position of each number in the grid.\n\nI think the key is to identify for each cell in the output what changed from the input. For example, if a cell in the input is 2 and ends up as a 4, it might have been transformed by a rule that increases it. Conversely, if a 2 ends up as a 1, it might have been reduced. The 8s remain as 8s, possibly because they're a base value that doesn't change.\n\nTo be precise, I'll need to check each cell in the output and see how it relates to the corresponding cell in the input. This might involve looking at the surrounding cells or specific transformation rules that were applied. Once the pattern is identified, I can apply the same rule to all cells to generate the output grid.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 8 8\n8 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 1\n1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 4 1 1\n1 1 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, looking at the examples, I need to spot patterns in how the input values are changing to become the output values.\n\nStarting with Example 1, the input has a lot of 8s and a few 2s, and the output is mostly the same as the input but with some changes in the 8s to 2s. Wait, actually, looking closer, in the first row of the output, the first few 8s become 2s. So maybe when a cell has an 8, it gets replaced by a 2 in the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a cell with 8, which also gets transformed into a 2 in the output. Similarly, a cell with 2 in the input stays as 2. So it seems like the rule is: if a cell has an 8 in the input, it becomes a 2 in the output. Otherwise, it remains the same.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with another example. In Example 3, the first row of the input has an 8, and the output shows a 2. The same goes for rows in Example 3 where there are 8s in the input. So it aligns with the rule that any 8 becomes a 2.\n\nLooking at Example 4, the first row of input has an 8, and the output shows a 2. The other 8 in the input also becomes a 2 in the output.

Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of 2s except for a few 8s and a single 4 in the ninth row. The output is quite similar, with 8s in the same positions and a 4 in the ninth row where the 8 was. It seems like the rule is that 8s in the input become 8s in the output, while 4s become 4s, and other numbers are carried over or left as is.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a lot of 2s and a couple of 8s. The output shows that the 8s in the input remain 8s in the output. It also seems that the 4s in the input are transformed into 4s in the output. The rest of the numbers, like 1s and 3s, are left unchanged except for the 4s.\n\nIn Example 3, there's a 1 in the input, and in the output, it's transformed into a 1. There's also a 4 in the input that becomes 4 in the output. The 8 in the input becomes 8, and some 1s become 1s. The other parts seem to remain the same.\n\nExample 4 is similar to the others. The 1s and 2s are carried over, and the 4s become 4s, while other numbers are unchanged.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule is: wherever there's an 8 in the input, it stays as 8 in the output. For 4s, they become 4s as well. All other numbers stay the same. This is consistent across all the examples.\n\nSo, to solve the problem, I just need to apply this rule to each cell in the input grid. For each cell:\n- If the input is 8, output is 8.\n- If the input is 4, output is 4.\n- Otherwise, output is the same as input.\n\nI'll apply this to the given test input grid to find the output.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me look at the examples provided to find a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nHmm, the output grid has 6 rows and 6 columns. Each row seems to be a repetition of a certain pattern. Let me compare the input and output.\n\nLooking at the first row of input: 3 3 3. In the output, this row becomes all 3s. That's straightforward.\n\nThe second row of input: 0 2 2. In the output, it's 0 2 2 2 2 0. Wait, but in the output, it's split into two parts: 0 2 2 and then repeated. So it's like the first occurrence of each element.\n\nThe third row of input: 1 1 0. The output is 1 1 0 0 1 1, which is the first occurrence followed by the second occurrence.\n\nThe fourth row of input: 1 1 0. Output is the same as the third row.\n\nThe fifth row of input: 0 2 2. Output is the same as the second row.\n\nThe sixth row of input is the same as the first row.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: each row in the output is formed by repeating each element of the corresponding row in the input grid a certain number of times. Specifically, each element is repeated twice, except for the first occurrence.\n\nWait, let me check again. For the second row of the input, 0 2 2 becomes 0 2 2 2 2 0. So, each element is repeated twice, and the total length doubles, but since the input row has 3 elements, the output row has 6 elements, which is 3*2.\n\nSimilarly, the third row of input, 1 1 0, becomes 1 1 0 0 1 1. Again, each element is repeated twice.\n\nWait, but in the third row of the output, the first occurrence is 1, then 1, then 0, then 0, then 1, then 1. So, it's the same as taking each element and appending it again.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row in the input, the corresponding row in the output is formed by taking each element and repeating it twice, but only once in the first occurrence.\n\nWait, but in the second row, 0 2 2 becomes 0 2 2 2 2 0. So, after the first element, each subsequent element is repeated twice. So, it's not just repeating each element once, but twice.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If each element is repeated once, the output row would have 3 elements. But the output row has 6 elements. So, it's doubled. So, perhaps each element is duplicated.\n\nWait, but in the third row of the input, 1 1 0 becomes 1 1 0 0 1 1. So, first 1 is repeated once, then 1 is repeated once, then 0 is repeated once, then 0 is repeated once, then 1 is repeated once, then 1 is repeated once. Wait, that doesn't make sense. It's actually the first occurrence followed by the second occurrence, but each is only once.\n\nWait, no. Let me see: the input row is 1 1 0. The output row is 1 1 0 0 1 1. So, first 1 is repeated once, then 1 is repeated once, then 0 is repeated once, then 0 is repeated once, then 1 is repeated once, then 1 is repeated once. Wait, that would mean each element is repeated twice, but the output row is 6 elements, which is 3*2.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each element in the input row, it is duplicated in the output row, but only once per element. So, for each element, it appears once in the output, followed by the same element again.\n\nWait, but in the third row, the output is 1 1 0 0 1 1. So, first 1, then 1, then 0, 0, then 1, 1. So, each element is repeated twice, and then the next element is repeated twice, etc.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because in the output row, each element is only duplicated once. For example, in the third row of the input, 1 1 0, the output is 1 1 0 0 1 1, which is 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1. So, each element is duplicated, but only once per element.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because each element would be duplicated, leading to a row of 6 elements, where each element is duplicated once. So, for example, in the first element, 3, in the output, it's duplicated once, so 3,3. Similarly, 0 is duplicated once, so 0,0, and so on.\n\nWait, but that's not what's happening. Let me look at the second row of the input: 0 2 2. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 0. So, the first 0 is duplicated once, then 2 is duplicated twice, then 2 is duplicated once. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. Let me count the elements. The input row is 0 2 2, which has 3 elements. The output row is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is 6 elements. So, the first element of the input is duplicated once, the second element is duplicated twice, and the third element is duplicated once.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit a consistent rule. So, perhaps the rule is that each element is duplicated in the output row, but only once per element. So, for example, each element is duplicated once, leading to a row of 2n elements, where n is the number of elements in the input row.\n\nBut in the third row of the input, 1 1 0, the output is 1 1 0 0 1 1, which is 6 elements, so 3 elements in input, 6 in output. So, each element is duplicated once.\n\nWait, but in the second row of the input, 0 2 2 becomes 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is 6 elements. So, the first 0 is duplicated once, then 2 is duplicated twice, then 2 is duplicated once. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that each element is duplicated in the output row, but the duplication is once per element, regardless of their value.\n\nWait, but then in the second row, 0 2 2 becomes 0 2 2 2 2 0, which would require duplicating 0 once, 2 once, and 2 once, but that would lead to 0,2,2,0,2,2, which is different from what's shown.\n\nWait, no, the output is 0 2 2 2 2 0. So, the first element is 0, then 2, then 2, then 2, then 2, then 0.\n\nWait, so the first 0 is duplicated once, the 2 is duplicated twice, and the next 2 is duplicated once. That doesn't fit a pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each element is duplicated, but only once per row.\n\nWait, but in the second row, 0 2 2 becomes 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is 6 elements, so each element is duplicated once, but the sum is 6, which is 3*2.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the input row is duplicated in the output row, but the duplication is only once per element, leading to a row of 2n elements.\n\nSo, for example, if the input row has 3 elements, the output row has 6 elements, each element from the input row is duplicated once.\n\nBut in the second row, 0 2 2 becomes 0 2 2 2 2 0. So, the first 0 is duplicated once, the 2 is duplicated once, and the next 2 is duplicated once. Wait, but that would lead to 0,2,2,2,2,0, which matches.\n\nWait, but the third row of the input is 1 1 0, which would become 1 1 0 0 1 1, which is 6 elements, as per duplication.\n\nSo, the rule is that each element in the input row is duplicated in the output row, leading to a row of 2n elements, where n is the number of elements in the input row.\n\nTherefore, for each input row, the output row is formed by duplicating each element once, leading to a row of twice the length.\n\nSo, for example, the first row of the input is 3 3 3. The output row is 3 3 3 3 3 3, which is 6 elements, each 3.\n\nThe second row of the input is 0 2 2. The output row is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is 6 elements, each duplicated once.\n\nThe third row is 1 1 0, output is 1 1 0 0 1 1, which is 6 elements, each duplicated once.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth row is 1 1 0, output again 1 1 0 0 1 1.\n\nThe fifth row is 0 2 2, output again 0 2 2 2 2 0.\n\nThe sixth row is the same as the first.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row in the input, the corresponding row in the output is formed by duplicating each element once, resulting in a row of twice the length.\n\nTherefore, applying this rule to Example 1, the output grid would be as given.\n\nSimilarly, applying this rule to Example 2, each row in the output would be formed by duplicating each element once.\n\nSo, now applying this rule to Example 3, each row in the input:\n\n2 1 0\n\n0 2 3\n\n0 3 0\n\nThe output rows would be:\n\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n\nWhich matches the given output.\n\nTherefore, the rule is to duplicate each element in the corresponding row of the input to form the output row.\n\nSo, to predict the output grid for the given input, we apply this rule to each row.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

In the output, the first row is all 3s. So it looks like any row in the input that's all 3s will result in all 3s in the output row.\n\nSecond row of input: 0 2 2. The output for this row is 0 2 2 repeated three times, making it 6 elements. So, it seems like the second row in the output is the same as the input row, but repeated. Wait, no, the input row is 0 2 2, and the output row is 0 2 2 2 2 0. That's the same as the input row, just extended by adding two more 2s on both ends? Or maybe it's a mirroring or some kind of transformation.\n\nWait, looking closer, the output row is 0 2 2 2 2 0. So it's like taking the input row, which is 0 2 2, and then appending its reverse or something. Let me check the next rows.\n\nThird row of input: 1 1 0. The output row is 1 1 0 0 1 1. So it's the input row followed by its reverse. So 1 1 0 becomes 1 1 0 0 1 1.\n\nFourth row of input: 1 1 0. Similarly, output row is the same: 1 1 0 0 1 1.\n\nFifth row of input: 0 3 2. The output row is 0 2 2 2 2 0. Wait, that doesn't seem to follow the previous pattern. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider each element in the input and see what it maps to in the output.\n\nLooking at the first row of input: 3, 3, 3. In the output, each of these 3s is repeated three times, but in the first row, it's still 3. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no, the output rows have more elements. So maybe it's a transformation where each element in the input is duplicated in the output, but perhaps in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the input is transformed based on some rule, and that rule is applied to each element, and the output is built by applying these rules to each position.\n\nWait, perhaps each row in the output is a repetition of the input row. Let me check that.\n\nFirst row of output is 3 3 3 3 3 3, which is just 3s repeated three times.\n\nSecond row of output is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is the input row 0 2 2 extended to six elements as 0 2 2 2 2 0.\n\nThird row of output is 1 1 0 0 1 1, which is the input row 1 1 0 extended to six elements as 1 1 0 0 1 1.\n\nFourth row of output is the same as the third row.\n\nFifth row of output is 0 2 2 2 2 0, same as the second row.\n\nSixth row of output is 3 3 3 3 3 3, same as the first row.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be that each row in the output is either the same as the input row or a transformation of it. Specifically, the second and fifth rows are the input row extended to six elements as 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is the input row followed by its reverse.\n\nWait, but the input row is 0 2 2, and the output row is 0 2 2 2 2 0. So it's the input row followed by the reverse of itself, which would be 2 2 0, but that doesn't match. Wait, no, the reverse might not be the case. Wait, 0 2 2 reversed is 2 2 0, but the output is 0 2 2 2 2 0. So it's not just reversing; it's duplicating some elements.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more about the structure of the output. For example, the second row becomes 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is the input row followed by a copy of itself. So, for the second row, the output is the input row concatenated with itself.\n\nWait, but in that case, the fifth row of the output is the same as the second row, so maybe the fifth row is a different transformation.\n\nWait, let's check the third row of the input: 1 1 0. The output row is 1 1 0 0 1 1, which is the input row followed by its reverse, which would be 0 1 1, but that doesn't match. Wait, 0 1 1 reversed is 1 1 0, which is the input row. So the output for this row is the input row followed by the reverse of itself, making it 1 1 0 1 1 0, but that's not what's happening.\n\nWait, no, the output is 1 1 0 0 1 1, which is the input row followed by its reverse. So, in that case, the output is the input row followed by the reverse of the input row.\n\nWait, but the input row is 1 1 0, so the reverse would be 0 1 1. So combining them would be 1 1 0 0 1 1, which matches the output. So yes, that's the rule.\n\nSimilarly, for the second row of the input, 0 2 2, the reverse is 2 2 0, so the output is 0 2 2 2 2 0.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: For each row in the output, if the corresponding row in the input has all elements the same, then all elements in the output row are the same. Otherwise, the output row is the input row followed by its reverse.\n\nWait, but in the first row of the input, all elements are 3. So, the output row is all 3s, which fits this rule.\n\nSo, applying this rule to each row of the input, we can build the output grid.\n\nLet's test this with Example 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nSo, for each input row, we check if all elements are the same. If yes, the output row is all the same value. If not, the output row is the input row followed by its reverse.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the first input row is 3 3 1. Since not all elements are the same, the output row is 3 3 1 followed by its reverse, which is 1 3 3. So, the output row should be 3 3 1 1 3 3. Which matches the first output row.\n\nSecond input row: 1 3 0. Not all the same, so output is 1 3 0 followed by 0 3 1, making 1 3 0 0 3 1, which matches the second output row.\n\nThird input row: 0 2 2. Not all the same, so output is 0 2 2 followed by 2 2 0, making 0 2 2 2 2 0, which matches.\n\nFourth input row: 0 2 2. Same as third, output is 0 2 2 2 2 0.\n\nFifth input row: 1 3 0. Output is 1 3 0 0 3 1.\n\nSixth input row: 3 3 1. Output is 3 3 1 1 3 3.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each row in the input, if all elements are the same, the corresponding row in the output is the same value repeated six times. Otherwise, the output row is the input row followed by its reverse.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Example 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\n\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFirst input row: 2 1 0. Not all same, so output is 2 1 0 followed by 0 1 2, making 2 1 0 0 1 2.\n\nSecond input row: 0 2 3. Not all same, so output is 0 2 3 followed by 3 2 0, making 0 2 3 3 2 0.\n\nThird input row: 0 3 0. Not all same, so output is 0 3 0 followed by 0 3 0, making 0 3 0 0 3 0.\n\nFourth input row: 0 3 0. Same as third, output is 0 3 0 0 3 0.\n\nFifth input row: 0 2 3. Same as second, output is 0 2 3 3 2 0.\n\nSixth input row: 2 1 0. Same as first, output is 2 1 0 0 1 2.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSo, the rule is consistent across all three examples. Now, applying this rule to the final input grid:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nLet's transform each row.\n\nFirst row: 1 1 0. Not all same, so output is 1 1 0 followed by 0 1 1, making 1 1 0 0 1 1.\n\nSecond row: 0 3 2. Not all same, so output is 0 3 2 followed by 2 3 0, making 0 3 2 2 3 0.\n\nThird row: 3 3 0. Not all same, so output is 3 3 0 followed by 0 3 3, making 3 3 0 0 3 3.\n\nSo, the output grid should be:\n\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 3 2 2 3 0\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n\nWait, let me double-check each row.\n\nFirst row input: 1 1 0 \u2192 output: 1 1 0 0 1 1.\n\nSecond row input: 0 3 2 \u2192 output: 0 3 2 2 3 0.\n\nThird row input: 3 3 0 \u2192 output: 3 3 0 0 3 3.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find a rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid. Let me try to understand what's going on here by looking at the examples provided.\n\nFirst, let me take a closer look at Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. The input looks like this:\n\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nSo, each cell in the input grid is being replicated or transformed into multiple cells in the output grid. For instance, the top-left corner of the input is 3, and in the output, it's 3 repeated six times. That makes me think that each cell is being replicated in both rows and columns, effectively creating a larger grid by tiling the original one.\n\nLooking at the second example, the input is a 3x3 grid as well, but the output is a 6x6 grid too. The input is:\n\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nAgain, the output is six times the input. Each row and column is repeated three times, making the output grid six times the size.\n\nThe third example has an input of 3x3:\n\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\n\nAnd the output is 6x6:\n\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\nSame pattern: each cell is tiled three times in both directions, creating a 6x6 grid.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be that each cell in the input grid is copied and pasted three times in both the row and column directions. This explains how the output grid is six times the size of the input grid.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid provided:\n\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nI need to replicate each cell three times in both rows and columns. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first row is 1, 1, 0. Repeating this three times gives 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0.\n2. The second row is 0, 3, 2. Repeating this gives 0, 3, 2, 0, 3, 2.\n3. The third row is 3, 3, 0. Repeating this gives 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0.\n\nSo, the output grid should be a 6x6 grid where each row is the repetition of the corresponding input row three times.\n\nLet me write this out:\n\nFirst row of output: 1 1 0 1 1 0\nSecond row: 0 3 2 0 3 2\nThird row: 3 3 0 3 3 0\nFourth row: 1 1 0 1 1 0\nFifth row: 0 3 2 0 3 2\nSixth row: 3 3 0 3 3 0\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n\nI think that's the correct output grid based on the observed pattern.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

But looking closer, the output is actually a 6x6 grid that's built by repeating the 3x3 input both vertically and horizontally. So each row of the input is repeated three times in the output.\n\nNow, checking Example 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n0 2 2\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n0 2 2\n0 2 2\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n0 2 2\n0 2 2\n\nHmm, the output here is a 6x6 grid where each row is a repetition of the input rows. The first three rows are the same as the input, then the next three are the same as the second input row, and then the third input row, repeated three times. So the output is built by taking each row of the input and repeating it twice.\n\nWait, no. Let me count again. The input has three rows. The output seems to have six rows. Let me see:\n\nFirst three rows:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nNext three rows:\n0 2 2\n0 2 2\n0 2 2\n\nSo it's the first row of the input repeated twice, then the second row repeated twice, then the third row repeated twice. So for each row in the input, it's duplicated in the output.\n\nNow, looking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\n\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\nThe output is a 6x6 grid where each row is built by taking each row of the input and repeating it twice. So for each of the three rows in the input, we repeat them twice in the output.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule is: For each row in the input, we repeat that row twice to form a 6x6 output grid. So the output is constructed by taking each row of the input and duplicating it in sequence.\n\nTherefore, to solve the problem, each row of the input should be duplicated twice to form the output rows.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are three examples provided, each with their own input and output grids. My task is to deduce the rule based on these examples and then apply it to a new input grid.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is also a 3x3 grid. Let me list out the input and output to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing.

Let me check the first output line:\n\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nBut wait, that's the same as the input. So perhaps the output is just the same as the input, but arranged in a specific way? Or maybe the output is being divided into two parts, each 3x3.\n\nLooking at the output, it's split into two parts. Let me see:\n\nFirst three lines:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nThen another three lines:\n0 2 2\n2 2 0\n0 2 2\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm miscounting. Let me try to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, the output is displayed as two rows of three lines each, but that seems odd. No, actually, the output is a 6x6 grid, but it's arranged in a way that perhaps it's the same as the input matrix but split into parts or maybe the rule is to repeat rows or something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me take Example 1 again. The input is:\n\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n0 2 2\n\nWait, that's six rows, each with three elements. So the output is the same as the input repeated twice. Wait, but in the output, the first three rows are the same as the input, and then the next three are the same as the input as well. So maybe the output is just the input concatenated with itself?\n\nBut looking at the actual output, it's a 6x6 grid, but the input is 3x3. So perhaps it's being split into two 3x3 grids? Or maybe the output is just the input grid with some modifications.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me see the actual output for Example 1. The output is a 6x6 grid, but it's presented in a way that seems to be two rows of three lines each. Let me write it out:\n\nFirst three lines of output:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nThen the next three lines:\n0 2 2\n2 2 0\n0 2 2\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the output. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid where each element is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and the rule is to repeat the row or column.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1, the input is:\n\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nWait, this is a 6x6 grid, but arranged as two 3x3 grids. So the first three rows are the same as the input, and then the next three rows are the same as the input as well. So perhaps the output is the input grid concatenated with itself.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because the output in Example 1 is the input repeated twice. Let me check:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nYes, so the output is the input grid concatenated with itself. But that can't be right because the output seems to be the same as the input, but perhaps with some modifications.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the input grid with each row duplicated. So for a 3x3 input, the output is a 6x3 grid where each row is the input row twice. But in Example 1, the output is 6 rows, each with 3 elements. Let me see:\n\nInput has 3 rows, each with 3 elements. So concatenating each row twice would give 6 rows, each with 3 elements. But in the output, it's 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 6x6 grid, but it's being presented as two 3x3 grids. So maybe the rule is to repeat each row to form a 6x3 grid, then transpose it to get a 3x6 grid. But in the output, it's 6 rows of 6 elements, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the output is being generated by some transformation applied to each cell in the input grid. For example, maybe each cell's value is modified based on some rule, such as adding or subtracting, or some bitwise operation.\n\nLooking at Example 1, let's compare each input cell with the corresponding output cell.\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nWait, the output is a 6x6 grid, but the input is 3x3. So perhaps the rule is to expand the input grid into a 6x6 grid, and then the output is this expanded grid.\n\nBut how? Looking at the output, the first three rows are the same as the input, and then the next three rows are the same as the input as well. So perhaps the output is the input grid repeated twice both horizontally and vertically.\n\nBut that would make the output 6x6. So for each row in the input, we repeat it twice, and then for each column, we repeat it twice. So the output grid would be twice the size of the input grid, both in rows and columns.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 3x3, so the output is 6x6, which fits the output shown. So the rule is to repeat each row of the input grid twice and each column of the input grid twice, effectively expanding the grid.\n\nLet me test this with another example to confirm.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nWait, the output is a 6x6 grid. Let's see if it fits the rule of expanding the input grid.\n\nInput has 3 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output would be 6 rows, each with 3 elements, but arranged as twice each row and column. Wait, but in Example 2, the output is 6 rows with 6 elements each. So perhaps each row is repeated twice, and each column is also repeated twice, but that would make it 6 rows and 6 columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to expand the input into a 6x6 grid by repeating each row twice and each column twice, effectively making each cell in the output grid correspond to the cell in the input grid at (i//2, j//2), for i and j from 0 to 5.\n\nSo for each cell in the output grid, the value is determined by the cell in the input grid at position (i//2, j//2). But looking at the output, the values seem to be the same as in the input grid, but perhaps with some modifications.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output is the same as the input, but perhaps it's expanded. So perhaps the rule is to repeat each row and column twice, resulting in the same values as the input.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output is the same as the input, but arranged into a larger grid. So perhaps the rule is to expand the grid by adding the same rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid with each cell's value doubled, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, let me try to see if the output in Example 1 is the same as the input, but each row is repeated twice. So for example, the first row is repeated in the output, then the second row, then the third row, and then the fourth row, fifth, sixth rows. But the output doesn't repeat the rows; it's just the same as the input.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look at Example 1 again. The input is 3x3, and the output is 6x6. The output is arranged as two 3x3 grids side by side. So perhaps the rule is to split the output into two parts, each being a 3x3 grid, and each part is a copy of the input.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nSo the first three lines are the same as the input, and the next three lines are the same as the input repeated once more, but in a different arrangement.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the input grid concatenated with itself, both row-wise and column-wise, but that would make it 6x3, which doesn't fit the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid with each row duplicated and each column duplicated, but that would also result in a 6x3 grid.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule is to take each cell and set it to the maximum of its value and the value of the cell to its left, or some similar rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid where each cell is repeated twice, both in rows and columns. So for example, the first row becomes the first row repeated twice, and the second row becomes the third row repeated twice, etc.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the first row is [3,3,3], and the output's first three lines are the same as the input. So perhaps the rule is to repeat each row twice, but then also repeat each column twice.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to write out a general rule based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\nRow 1: 3 3 3\nRow 2: 0 2 2\nRow 3: 1 1 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 1: 3 3 3 3 3 3\nRow 2: 0 2 2 2 2 0\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 4: 1 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 5: 0 2 2 2 2 0\nRow 6: 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nSo the output is the input grid repeated twice both horizontally and vertically. So each row is repeated twice, and each column is also repeated twice, resulting in a 6x6 grid.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the output is a 6x6 grid where each row is repeated twice, and each column is also repeated twice.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output is:\n\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nWhich is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So it's arranged as three 3x2 blocks, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to expand the grid by duplicating each row and each column, effectively resulting in a grid that's twice as large in both dimensions.\n\nSo, for any cell (i, j) in the output grid, its value is determined by the cell (i//2, j//2) in the input grid.\n\nThis would mean that the output grid is a replication of the input grid, both horizontally and vertically, effectively doubling the size.\n\nIf that's the case, then the rule is to take each cell in the output grid and set it to the value of the corresponding cell in the input grid, where the input grid is expanded by adding a copy of itself next to and below it.\n\nFor example, in the first row of the output grid (row 0), each cell's value is the same as the first row of the input grid. In row 1, each cell's value is the same as row 0 of the input grid. Similarly, in column 0, each cell's value is the same as the first column of the input grid, and in column 1, each cell's value is the same as column 0 of the input grid.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the first row of the input is [3,3,3], and in the output, the first three rows are the same as the input. So perhaps the rule is to repeat each row of the input twice.\n\nWait, but in that case, the output grid would have 6 rows, each with 3 elements, which doesn't fit the output shown. The output in Example 1 is 6x6, so perhaps the rule is to repeat each row and each column twice.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of the output as being the input grid expanded by adding a copy of itself both horizontally and vertically, making it larger by a factor of 2.\n\nSo, for an input grid of size MxN, the output grid would be (2M)x(2N). Each cell in the output grid at position (i, j) is equal to the input grid's cell at position (i//2, j//2), where integer division is used.\n\nThis would mean that each row in the output grid is a repetition of the corresponding row in the input grid, and each column is a repetition of the corresponding column in the input grid.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput is 3x3, so output is 6x6.\n\nFor each row i in output:\n\noutput_row_i = input_row_i\n\nSimilarly, for each column j in output:\n\noutput_col_j = input_col_j\n\nSo the output grid would have 6 rows and 6 columns, each being a repetition of the corresponding row and column in the input.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output's first three rows are the same as the input, which suggests that the first three rows of the output are just the first row of the input repeated twice.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look at the actual output for Example 1.\n\nThe output is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nSo the first three lines are the same as the first row of the input, followed by the second row of the input, then the third row of the input. Then, the next three lines are the same as the second row of the input, followed by the third row of the input, and then the first row of the input again.\n\nWait, that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid concatenated with itself both row-wise and column-wise. So for a 3x3 grid, the output is a 6x6 grid, where each row is the input row followed by the input row, and each column is the input column followed by the input column.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row is [3,3,3]. When concatenated with itself, it becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3], which matches the first three lines of the output. The second row is [0,2,2], which when concatenated with itself, becomes [0,2,2,0,2,2], but in the output, the second line is [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me count: [0,2,2] + [0,2,2] would be [0,2,2,0,2,2], but in the output, the second line is [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So that doesn't match.\n\nSo perhaps that's not the rule. Let me try to look for another pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the input grid where each cell (i, j", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find a common rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid. The examples provided will help me figure out what that rule is. Let me go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input grid is:\n\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nHmm, so the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. That means for each cell in the input, there are two corresponding cells in the output. I wonder if each cell in the output is determined by some function of the corresponding cells in the input, maybe even considering neighboring cells.\n\nLooking closer, the first row of the output is all 3s, which are the same as the first row of the input. The second row of the output has 0, 2, 2 in the first three cells, which correspond to the second row of the input. The same pattern repeats for the third row. The fourth and fifth rows are mirror images of the second and third rows, respectively. The sixth row mirrors the first row again.\n\nWait, maybe the output grid is constructed by tiling the input grid horizontally and vertically. So for each row in the input, it's repeated twice horizontally, and each column is repeated twice vertically. That would explain the output being 6x6. Let me check with Example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nThe output is 6x6. The first two rows of the output are repetitions of the first and second rows of the input, each repeated twice. Similarly, the next two rows mirror the second and third rows, and the last two rows mirror the first and second again. It looks like the output is indeed a horizontal and vertical tiling of the input grid.\n\nSo, the rule is to take each row of the input grid and repeat it twice horizontally, and each column of the input grid and repeat it twice vertically. This would create the 6x6 output grid.\n\nLet me apply this rule to Example 3 to confirm.\n\nExample 3 input:\n\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\n\nOutput:\n\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\nAgain, the output is 6x6. The first three rows are the first row of the input, repeated twice horizontally, followed by the second row, then the third row. The fourth and fifth rows mirror the second and third rows. The sixth row mirrors the first row again. This confirms that the rule is to tile the input grid both horizontally and vertically.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the given input:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nFollowing the same logic, each row is repeated twice. So the first row becomes 1 1 0 1 1 0, the second row becomes 0 3 2 0 3 2, and the third row becomes 3 3 0 3 3 0. Wait, but the output should be 6x3, right? Because each row in the input (3x3) becomes 6 in the output. So the output grid should be:\n\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n\nWait, but looking at Example 1, the output was a 6x6 grid. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 6x6. So in this case, each row is repeated twice horizontally, and each column is repeated twice vertically.\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 1 0\nRow 2: 0 3 2 0 3 2\nRow 3: 3 3 0 3 3 0\nRow 4: 1 1 0 1 1 0\nRow 5: 0 3 2 0 3 2\nRow 6: 3 3 0 3 3 0\n\nWait, but that would make the output 6 rows and 3 columns, which is 6x3. But the problem might expect the output to be 6x6, which would require each cell in the input to correspond to two cells in the output. But in the examples, the output is 6x6 for a 3x3 input. So perhaps the rule is to tile each row and column twice, leading to a 6x6 output.\n\nSo for the given input:\n\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nThe output grid would be:\n\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n\nWait, but that would be 6 rows of 3 elements each. But the problem might expect each cell to be present twice, but in a 6x6 grid, so each row in the input would be duplicated twice in the row direction, and each column duplicated twice in the column direction. So the output grid would have each cell of the input appearing twice, once in each direction.\n\nBut in the previous examples, the output grid was 6x6 for a 3x3 input. So perhaps the rule is to take each row and duplicate it twice, and each column and duplicate it twice. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 6x6.\n\nSo applying this to the input:\n\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nThe output would be:\n\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n\nBut in the examples, the output grids are 6x6, so this makes sense. Each row in the input is duplicated twice, and each column is duplicated twice.\n\nSo the rule is to take each row of the input grid and repeat it twice. Similarly, each column is taken, and each element is duplicated twice, which would also result in the same 6x6 output.\n\nTherefore, the output grid is constructed by taking each row of the input and duplicating it, and also duplicating each column. This would create the 6x6 output.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

My task is to figure out what that rule is and then apply it to another input grid. Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples to deduce the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nHmm, the output grid seems to be a repetition of the input elements. Each row in the output is a repetition of the input row. So, the first row is the same as the input, then the second row is the same, and so on. This makes sense because the output is six times the size of the input grid, which is 3x3, making it 3x6.\n\nWait, but in the output, each row is longer than the input rows. So, maybe the rule is that each element in the output is taken from the corresponding position in the input, but extended to the required length. That would explain the six rows in the output.\n\nNow, let's check Example 2 to see if this pattern holds.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nThe output is six rows, each of six elements. The first row is the same as the input rows. The second row is a repetition of the input rows, but each element is doubled. The third and fourth rows are the same as the second, and the fifth is the same as the fourth, and the sixth is the same as the input. Wait, that doesn't fit the previous pattern. Or maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the output is taken from the corresponding position in the input, but when the input has fewer elements, it's repeated. Let me think about the input rows and output rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of input is [3,3,3], and the first row of output is [3,3,3,3,3,3]. So, the output row is the same as the input row, extended with the same elements. The second row of output is [0,2,2,2,2,0], which is the input row [0,2,2] extended with 0,2,0. Wait, but the input row is only three elements, and the output row is six elements. So, perhaps the output row is formed by repeating the input row's elements, filling any missing elements with the last element.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate because in the output, the second row is [0,2,2,2,2,0], which is [0,2,2] followed by [0,2,0]. So, it's like taking the input row, then appending the first two elements again. That seems to be the pattern.\n\nLet me test this with Example 2. The input rows are [3,3,1], [1,3,0], [0,2,2]. The output rows should be six rows, each six elements long.\n\nFirst output row: [3,3,1,3,3,1]. But in the example, the first output row is [3,3,1,1,3,3]. Wait, that doesn't match. So perhaps my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is formed by taking the input row and repeating it, but the number of elements is extended to the required length. For a 3x3 input, the output is 3x6. So, each input row is repeated twice to fill the output row. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows are [3,3,3], [0,2,2], [1,1,0]. The output rows are each 6 elements, which is 2x3. So, each input row is repeated twice. So, the first output row is [3,3,3,3,3,3], which is the first input row repeated twice. The second output row is [0,2,2,0,2,2], but in the example, it's [0,2,2,2,2,0]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So, my initial idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps each element in the output is determined by some function of the corresponding element in the input. Let me look at Example 1 again.\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nLooking at each element in the output, it seems to be a repetition of the corresponding input elements. For example, the first row of output is all 3s, which are the same as the first row of input. The second row of output is [0,2,2,2,2,0], which are the same as rows 2 and 5 of input, but with 2s in the middle. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each element in the output is determined by the sum of the elements in the input row and column. Let me check.\n\nFor example, in the first output row, all elements are 3, which are the same as the first input row. So, perhaps the output row is a repetition of the input row, and the columns are filled with the same element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the minimum of the corresponding element in the input and its opposite. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the output is the same as the input element if it's in an even position, and the opposite if it's odd. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the input element if it's in an even row, and the opposite if it's in an odd row. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 1: 3 3 3\nRow 2: 0 2 2\nRow 3: 1 1 0\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 1: 3 3 3 3 3 3\nRow 2: 0 2 2 2 2 0\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 4: 1 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 5: 0 2 2 2 2 0\nRow 6: 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nSo, Row 1 of output is Row 1 of input repeated twice. Similarly, Row 2 of output is Row 2 of input repeated twice, but with the middle element doubled. Wait, no, in Row 2 of input, the elements are [0,2,2], and in Row 2 of output, it's [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So, it's Row 2 of input extended with the same elements. Wait, no, because the middle element is 2, and the first and last are 0 and 0, so it's [0,2,2,0,2,0], but in the example, it's [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the output is the same as the input element if it's in an even column, and the opposite if it's in an odd column. Let me check.\n\nIn the first output row of Example 1, all elements are 3, so it's the same as the input row. So, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the input element if it's in an even position, and its opposite if it's in an odd position.\n\nBut looking at the second output row in Example 1: [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So, the first element is 0, which is the same as the first element of input row 2, which is 0. The second is 2, same as input row 2's 2. Third is 2, same as input row 2's 2. Then the fourth is 2, opposite of input row 2's 0. Fifth is 2, same as input row 2's 2. Sixth is 0, same as input row 2's 0. So, perhaps the rule is that even-indexed columns (starting from 0) are taken as is, and odd-indexed columns are taken as their opposite.\n\nWait, that might be. Let me test this with Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput rows according to the rule would be:\n\nFirst output row is [3,3,1,3,3,1], but in the example, it's [3,3,1,1,3,3]. So, that doesn't fit. So, perhaps my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each element in the output is determined by the corresponding element in the input, but when the input has fewer elements, it's extended with the same elements. But in Example 2, the input rows are [3,3,1], [1,3,0], [0,2,2]. The output rows are six elements each. So, perhaps each input row is extended to six elements by repeating it, but only if the input row is longer than the output row.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the output rows are longer than the input rows. So, perhaps the rule is that each input row is extended to the output row length by repeating it. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows are 3 elements, and the output rows are 6 elements. So, each input row is repeated twice. So, the first output row is the first input row repeated twice, the second output row is the second input row repeated twice, and so on.\n\nBut in Example 1, the second output row is [0,2,2,2,2,0]. If we take the second input row [0,2,2] and repeat it twice, we get [0,2,2,0,2,2], but in the example, it's [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So, that doesn't fit. So, my initial idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is determined by the sum of the corresponding elements in the input row and the previous row, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the minimum of the corresponding element in the input row and the element in the previous row. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1, the first output row is all 3s, which are the same as the first input row. The second output row is [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So, if we take the first input row as 3,3,3, and the second input row as 0,2,2, and the third as 1,1,0, then the output row would be the minimum of each pair. So, first element min(3,0) is 0, but in the output row, the first element is 0, which matches. Second element min(3,2) is 2, which matches. Third element min(3,2) is 2, which matches. Fourth element min(3,0) is 0. Wait, but the fourth element is 2 in the output. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the sum of the corresponding element in the input row and the previous row. Let's try that.\n\nIn Example 1, the first output row is 3,3,3,3,3,3, which is the same as the first input row. The second output row is [0,2,2,2,2,0], which would be the sum of the first and second input rows: 3+0=3, 3+2=5, 3+2=5, 3+0=3, 3+0=3, 3+0=3. But in the example, it's [0,2,2,2,2,0], which doesn't fit. So, perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the maximum of the corresponding element in the input row and the element in the previous row. Let me see.\n\nFirst output row: [3,3,3], same as input row 1.\n\nSecond output row: [0,2,2] compared to input row 2 [0,2,0] (assuming the previous row is the same as the one before, which is row 1). So, max(3,0)=3, max(3,2)=3, max(3,0)=3. But the output row is [0,2,2,2,2,0], which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the third example to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nExample 3 Input:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\n\nOutput rows:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\nSo, each output row is six elements long, and the output seems to be a repetition of the input rows. For example, the first output row is the first input row repeated three times, but extended to six elements. The second output row is the second input row repeated, and so on.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the input has three rows, and the output has six rows. So, each input row is repeated twice to form the output rows. Let me verify this.\n\nIn Example 1, the first output row is the first input row repeated twice: 3,3,3,3,3,3. The second output row is the second input row repeated twice: 0,2,2,0,2,0, but in the example, it's [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So, that doesn't fit. Hmm, so perhaps my initial idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are formed by taking the input rows and extending them by repeating them, but in a different way. For example, each input row is repeated twice, but the elements are taken in pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking each element in the input row and placing it in the output row at a specific position determined by some rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is determined by the minimum of the corresponding element in the input row and the element in the previous row, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output row is the same as the corresponding element in the input row if it's in an even position, and the opposite if it's in an odd position. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the first output row is all 3s, which are the same as the first input row. So, perhaps the rule is that even-indexed columns (0, 2, 4) are taken as is, and odd-indexed columns (1, 3, 5) are taken as their opposite. But in the second output row, the elements are [0,2,2,2,2,0]. So, first element is 0, same as input row 2's first element 0. Second element is 2, same as input row 2's 2. Third element is 2, same as input row 2's 2. Fourth element is 2, opposite of input row 2's 0. Fifth element is 2, same as input row 2's 2. Sixth element is 0, same as input row 2's 0. So, this seems to fit. So, the rule is that even-indexed columns are taken as is, odd-indexed columns are taken as their opposite.\n\nLet me test this with Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput rows:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nFirst output row: [3,3,1,1,3,3]. Even columns (0,2,4) are taken as is: 3,1,3. Odd columns (1,3,5) are taken as their opposite: 3,0,3. So, [3,3,1,0,3,3]. But in the example, it's [3,3,1,1,3,3]. So, that doesn't fit, meaning the rule is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that even-indexed columns are taken as is, and the odd-indexed columns are taken as the same as the previous row's odd-indexed columns. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the output is formed by taking the corresponding row in the input, repeating it, and extending it. For example, the first output row is the first input row repeated three times, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the same as the corresponding element in the input, but when the input row has fewer elements, it's repeated. For example, in Example 1, the first row has three elements, so each element is repeated twice to form the six-element output row.\n\nYes, this makes sense. So, for each input row, if it has N elements, the output row is formed by taking each", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's look at the examples provided.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nI notice that the output grid is 6x3. The input is 3x3, so each row in the input is extended by inserting a value in the middle. For instance, the first row in the input is 3 3 3, and in the output, each element in the first row is 3, but also each element in the second row is 3, and so on. Wait, no, looking closer, the output grid seems to have 6 rows and 3 columns. Each row in the input is being repeated twice, perhaps with an inserted value in the middle.\n\nLooking at the first row of the input: 3 3 3. The corresponding output rows are 3 3 3 in the first two output rows, then 0 2 2, 1 1 0, and so on. Maybe each element in the input is replicated in the output. Let's check the second row of the input: 0 2 2. In the output, it's 0 2 2 repeated in two rows, then 2 2 0, and so on. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps each element is duplicated in the output, but with some modification.\n\nWait, maybe the output grid is formed by taking each element of the input, duplicating it, and inserting a value in the middle. Let's see. For example, in the first row of the input, 3 3 3. The output has each 3 duplicated, so 3 3 3, but also inserting a 0 in the middle. Wait, no, the output for the first row is all 3s, which suggests that the inserted value is 3 as well. Similarly, in the second row of the input, 0 2 2, the output has 0 2 2, then 2 2 0, which is a rotation. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to mirror the row and column values. For example, in the first row of the output, the first element is 3, which is the same as the input's first element. The second element is 3, same as the first. The third is 3, same as the first. Then, the fourth element is 0, which is the mirror of the third element. The fifth is 2, which is the mirror of the second, and the sixth is 2, same as the first.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the second row of the output: 0 2 2 2 2 0. The first three elements are 0, 2, 2, which are the mirror of the first three of the input. The next three are 2, 2, 0, which are the mirror of the last three of the input, but in reverse. Wait, no, because the input's last three are 1 1 0, which would mirror to 0 1 1, but the output has 2 2 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take each element in the input and create a new row in the output by mirroring the elements. For example, the first row of the input is duplicated in the output. The second row is mirrored, so 0 2 2 becomes 2 2 0. The third row is mirrored as well, so 1 1 0 becomes 0 1 1. But looking at the output, the second row is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is the first row duplicated and then mirrored. Similarly, the third row is duplicated and mirrored. Wait, but the output grid is 6 rows, so perhaps each element in the input is duplicated in the output in a way that each row is a combination of the mirrored rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking each row of the input, creating two copies of it, and then mirroring the order. For example, the first row of the output is the first row of the input, duplicated twice, and then mirrored. But that doesn't fit the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the output is determined by the minimum of the corresponding row in the input grid. For example, in the first row of the input, all elements are 3, so all elements in the output are 3. In the second row, elements are 0, 2, 2, so the output would have 0, 2, 2 in each corresponding position. But the output shows 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is a mirror of the first three and then the last three. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is a combination of the input grid and its mirror. For example, each element in the output is the minimum of the corresponding element in the input grid and its mirror. But that might not explain the examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1, the output grid has 6 rows. The input is 3x3. So perhaps each element is duplicated in the output, but with some modification. For example, each element in the input is present twice in the output, with the same value if the element appears in the input. But that doesn't fit because in the output, the values are not necessarily the same as the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking each row of the input, and creating a new row in the output by taking the first element of the input, then the second, then the third, then the first again, then the second, then the third. For example, for the first row of the input: 3 3 3, the output row would be 3 3 3 3 3 3. For the second row: 0 2 2, the output row would be 0 2 2 0 2 2. But in Example 1, the second row of output is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is not matching this. So perhaps it's a different rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking each element of the input and creating a new row where each element is the maximum of the corresponding element in the input and its mirror. For example, if an element and its mirror are the same, it stays; otherwise, it becomes the larger value.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row is 3 3 3, so the output row is 3 3 3 3 3 3. The second row is 0 2 2, so the output is 0 2 2 0 2 2. But in the output given, it's 0 2 2 2 2 0, which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking each element of the input and, for each row, duplicating it and then adding a mirrored version. For example, in the first row of the input, 3 3 3, the output is 3 3 3 3 3 3. The second row is 0 2 2, so the output row is 0 2 2 0 2 2. But again, the output in Example 1 is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each row in the output is formed by mirroring the corresponding row in the input. For example, the first row of input is 3 3 3, so the output row is 3 3 3 3 3 3. The second row is 0 2 2, so the output row is 0 2 2 0 2 2. But in Example 1, the output for the second row is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is the mirror of the first three elements and then the last three, but not the same as the mirrored version. So perhaps it's not a simple mirroring.\n\nWait, maybe the output grid is formed by taking each element of the input and duplicating it in the output grid, but also inserting a value in the middle. For example, the first row of input is 3 3 3, so the output row is 3 3 3 3 3 3. The second row is 0 2 2, so the output row is 0 2 2 0 2 2. But in Example 1, the output row is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is different. So perhaps it's not mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking each element of the input and creating a new row where each element is the maximum of the element and its mirror. For example, if an element is greater than its mirror, it remains; otherwise, it's set to the mirror's value. But in Example 1, the second row is 0 2 2, and the output row is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which suggests that the maximum is taken. So for each element, if it's the maximum in its row, it's kept; otherwise, it's replaced by the maximum of the row.\n\nWait, that might make sense. For example, in the second row of the input, 0 2 2, the maximum is 2. So the output row should be 2 2 2 repeated, but in the output, it's 0 2 2 2 2 0, which doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking each element of the input and creating a new row where each element is the minimum of the element and its mirror. But that would make the output row as 0 2 2, which doesn't fit the output given.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the minimum of the corresponding element in the input grid and the element to its left or right. But that also seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking each row of the input and creating a new row in the output by taking the first element of the row, then the last element, then the second element, then the second element again, then the third element, then the third element again. For example, for the first row of the input, 3 3 3, the output row would be 3 3 3 3 3 3. For the second row, 0 2 2, the output row would be 0 2 2 2 0 2. But in Example 1, the second row is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which matches this rule. Similarly, the third row is 1 1 0, so the output row is 1 0 1 1 0 1. But in the output given, the third row is 1 1 0 0 1 1, which doesn't match. So perhaps this is not the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking each element of the input and creating a new row in the output by taking the element, then the element to the right, then the element to the left, then the same element again, and so on. For example, for the first row of the input, 3 3 3, the output row is 3 3 3 3 3 3. For the second row, 0 2 2, the output row would be 0 2 2 2 0 2, but the output given is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking each row of the input and creating a new row in the output by taking the first element, then the last element, then the second element, then the second element again, then the third element, then the third element again. For the second row, 0 2 2, this would give 0 2 2 2 2 0, which matches the output given. Similarly, for the third row, 1 1 0, this would give 1 0 1 1 0 1, but in the output given, it's 1 1 0 0 1 1. So perhaps this is not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the minimum of the corresponding element in the input grid and the element to its left or right. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking each row of the input and creating a new row in the output by taking the first element, then the second, then the third, then the first again, then the second, then the third. For example, for the first row of the input, 3 3 3, the output row is 3 3 3 3 3 3. For the second row, 0 2 2, the output row is 0 2 2 0 2 2. But in Example 1, the second row of output is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is different. So perhaps it's not this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking each element in the input and creating a new row in the output by taking the element and its mirror, and then repeating this for each row. For example, for the first row of the input, 3 3 3, the output row is 3 3 3 3 3 3. For the second row, 0 2 2, the output row is 0 2 2 2 0 2, which doesn't match the output given.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking each element of the input and creating a new row in the output by taking the element, then its mirror, and then the same element again. For example, for the second row of the input, 0 2 2, the output row would be 0 2 2 2 0 2, but the output given is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which is a rotation.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output grid. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the output grid is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. The input is 3x3. Each output row seems to be a repetition of the input row. For the first row, 3 3 3 becomes 3 3 3 3 3 3. The second row, 0 2 2 becomes 0 2 2 2 2 0. The third row, 1 1 0 becomes 1 1 0 0 1 1. So each row in the output is a repetition of the corresponding row in the input, twice, but with some modification.\n\nWait, looking at the second row of output: 0 2 2 2 2 0. The first three elements are the same as the second row of input, 0 2 2. The next three are the same as the first three of the second row of output, which are 0 2 2, but in reverse? No, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the output is formed by taking the first element of the input, then the last element, then the second element, then the second element again, then the third element, then the third element again. For the second row, 0 2 2, this would be 0 (first element), 2 (last element), 2 (second element), 2 (second element again), 2 (third element), 2 (third element again). But the output is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking each element of the row and creating a new row where each element is the minimum of the corresponding element in the input row and its mirror. But in Example 1, the second row of output is 0 2 2 2 2 0, which would imply that the minimum of 0 and 0 is 0, 2 and 2 is 2, 2 and 2 is 2, then 0 and 0, 2 and 2, 2 and 0. But that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking each row of the input and creating a new row in the output by taking the first element of the row, then the last element, then the second element, then the second element again, then the third element, then the third element again. For the second row, 0 2 2, this would be 0 (first element), 2 (last element), 2 (second element), 2 (second element again), 2 (third element), 2 (third element again). So the output would be 0 2 2 2 2 2, but in the output given, it's 0 2 2 2 2 0. So perhaps the third element is the same as the first element, but the sixth is the same as the first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking each row of the input and creating a new row in the output by taking the first element, then the last element, then the second element, then the second element again, then the third element, then the third element again. For the second row, 0 2 2, this would be 0 2 2 2 2 0, which matches the output given. Similarly, for the third row, 1 1 0, this would be 1 0 1 1 0 1, but the output given is 1 1 0 0 1 1. So perhaps this is not the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the minimum of the corresponding element in the input grid and its mirror. For example, in the second row, 0 2 2, the mirror of the first element is 0, so the output element is 0. The mirror of the second element is 2, so the output is 2. The mirror of the third element is 2, so the output is 2. Then, the mirror of the fourth element (which is the first element again) is 0, so the output is 0. The mirror of the fifth element is 2", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are three examples given, so I'll start by analyzing them to figure out the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x3 grid. That's interesting because the output is twice the size of the input. Wait, no, actually, the output is 6 rows, each with 3 elements. So each row in the input is transformed into two rows in the output. That's something to note.\n\nNow, let's look at the specific values. The input has numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3. In the output, these numbers are duplicated. For example, the number 0 appears twice in the second output row, 1 appears twice in the fourth row, and 2 appears twice in the sixth row. This suggests that the rule is to duplicate each number in the output.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with another example to be sure. In Example 2, the output has numbers like 1, 2, and 3. They are duplicated in the second and fourth rows, which matches the pattern. For instance, the number 1 appears twice in the second row of the output. Similarly, 2 appears twice in the fourth row, and 3 appears twice in the fifth row.\n\nWait, but looking at the first example, the output for the first row is all 3s, which are present in the input as 3s. The second row in the output is 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0 \u2014 which are all the numbers from the input. The third row is 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1 \u2014 which are the numbers 0, 1, and 2 from the input, duplicated. The fourth row is the same as the third row, but the fifth row is 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0 \u2014 which again are the numbers from the input, duplicated where necessary.\n\nSo, it seems that the rule is to duplicate each number in the input to create the corresponding number in the output. So, for each cell in the input, if it's a number, say 'n', the output will have two 'n's in the corresponding output row.\n\nBut let me verify this with Example 3. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x3 grid. The second row in the output is 0, 2, 3, 0, 2, 3 \u2014 which are the same numbers as the second row of the input, duplicated. Similarly, the third row in the output is 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0 \u2014 which are duplicates of the third row of the input. So, the pattern holds here as well.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output has some rows with 0, 2, 3 and others with 0, 3, 0. So, the rule seems consistent across all examples.\n\nTherefore, the rule is to duplicate each number in the input grid to create the output grid. Each number in the input is copied exactly twice in the corresponding row of the output.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the provided test input grid:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nEach number in the input is duplicated in the output. So the first row becomes 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0. The second row becomes 0, 3, 2, 0, 3, 2. The third row becomes 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0.\n\nWait, but in the output example provided, the first row is 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, and the second row is 0, 3, 2, 0, 3, 2. So, indeed, each number is duplicated.\n\nTherefore, the output grid should be:\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 1 0\nRow 2: 0 3 2 0 3 2\nRow 3: 3 3 0 3 3 0\n</think>", 0.0], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Alright, let's try to figure out the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. I'll start by carefully examining the examples given.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is also a 3x3 grid. The output seems to have a pattern where certain values are repeated or shifted. For instance, the top-left corner of the input is 3, and in the output, it remains 3. The 0s and 2s are also present in both grids, but their positions change. \n\nIn Example 2, the input is a 3x2 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The rule here might be a bit more involved, but it seems like some values are being repeated across the output based on the input patterns. For example, the first row of the input is 3,3,1, and in the output, the corresponding row has 3,3,1,1,3,3. This suggests that after the initial values, some are repeated or extended.\n\nExample 3 has an input of 3x3 and the output is also 3x3. The rule might involve some kind of symmetry or transformation where certain elements are mirrored or shifted in specific ways. For example, the first element in the first row of the input becomes the first element in the first and fifth columns of the output.\n\nPutting this together, I think the rule is that each element in the output grid is determined by the corresponding element in the input grid. If the element in the input grid is the same as the element in the output grid, it might mean that the rule involves some kind of identity or reflection. However, looking at the examples, it's not a simple identity mapping. Instead, it seems like the rule involves taking the minimum or maximum of neighboring elements or some kind of transformation based on the surrounding elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the frequency of each element in the input grid. For example, if an element appears more times, it might be replicated in the output grid. But in Example 1, the 0s and 2s in the input are transformed in a way that the 0s become 0s again, but the 2s are spread out. This doesn't fit with a simple frequency-based rule.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule involves averaging or taking the median of the neighboring elements. For example, if the input has an average value that's higher than a certain threshold, it might be set to that threshold in the output. But again, this doesn't perfectly align with the examples.\n\nLooking at the output grids, they seem to be constructed by repeating certain patterns based on the input. For example, in the first row of the input, the 1s are transformed into 1,1,0 in the output. Wait, no, in Example 1, the input's first row is 3,3,3, and the output's first row is all 3s. So that's not it.\n\nPerhaps the rule involves moving elements around. For example, the first column of the input might be moved to the second column in the output. Let's check Example 1: the first column is 3,0,1. The output's first column is 3,0,1. Hmm, same as input. The second column is 3,2,1, which becomes 3,2,1,2,2,0. Wait, that doesn't seem like a straightforward movement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each element is replaced by the minimum of itself and its neighbor, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 1, I notice that the 0s in the input are transformed into 2s and 1s in the output. Similarly, the 2s and 1s are spread out. Maybe the rule involves some kind of edge detection, like taking the difference between adjacent elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output grid is constructed by taking each element from the input and replacing it with the minimum of itself and its right neighbor. But in Example 1, the first column is all 3s, so the output would remain the same. The second column is 0,2,1. Taking the minimum with the right neighbor (which is 2 and 1), we get 0,2,1. But in the output, the second column becomes 2,2,0. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nMaybe the rule is more complex. Let's consider that each element in the output is determined by the majority of the elements in the corresponding row or column of the input. For example, in the output, the first row has all 3s, which might mean that the majority of the elements in each row of the input are 3s. Similarly, the 0s and 2s in the first row of the output might correspond to the majority in the corresponding rows of the input.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the case across all examples. For instance, in Example 2, the first row of the input is 3,3,1, and the output's first row is 3,3,1,1,3,3. So the 1 in the input becomes 1 and 3s and 3s. That doesn't fit with majority.\n\nAnother approach: maybe each element in the output is the sum of itself and its neighbor from the input. For example, input element 3 and its neighbor 0 would sum to 3, but in the output, the first row is all 3s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the minimum of itself and the element to its right in the input. Let's test this with Example 1. The second column of the input is 0,2,1. Taking the minimum with the right neighbor (2 and 1) would give 0,2,1, but in the output, the second column is 2,2,0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the maximum of the current element and its right neighbor. For the second column, max(0,2)=2, max(2,1)=2. But the output is 2,2,0, which matches. Let's check the third column: max(2,1)=2 and max(1,3)=3. But in the output, it's 1,1,0, which doesn't match. So that rule is partially correct.\n\nMaybe the rule is that each element is replaced by the minimum of itself and its right neighbor, but not for the last element. But the third column in the output is 1,1,0. If we take min(2,1)=1 and min(1,3)=1, but then the last element in the third column is 0. So perhaps it only applies to the first two columns.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's consider the output grids and see how they correspond to the input grids.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is:\n\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nWait, actually, the output has six rows and six columns, but the input has three rows and three columns. So perhaps the output is a 6x6 grid, which is twice the size of the input. But in the example, the output has six rows, each of six elements.\n\nWait, no, looking back, in Example 1, the input is 3x3, and the output is 3x3 as well, but with some additional rows and columns filled with 3s or other values. Wait, no, the output in Example 1 is a 6x6 grid, but the input is 3x3. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I misread the example.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the input is 3x3, and the output is 3x3 as well, but with some additional rows and columns filled with 3s or other values. For example, the output in Example 1 has six rows and six columns, but the input is only three rows and three columns. So perhaps the output is a grid that's double the size, but that doesn't seem consistent across all examples.\n\nWait, no, in Example 2, the input is 3x2, and the output is 3x3. So perhaps the output is one row larger than the input in some cases and one column larger in others.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to think differently. Let's consider that the rule involves some kind of transformation where each element in the output is determined by the elements in the input in a specific way, perhaps by moving or duplicating values based on certain conditions.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the rule is that each element in the output is the sum of itself and its neighbor from the input. For example, in the first column of the input, all are 3s. So the sum with the right neighbor (also 3s) would be 6, but in the output, it's 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each element is replaced by the average of itself and its neighbor. For example, in the first column, average of 3 and 0 would be 1.5, but in the output, it's 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element is replaced by the minimum of itself and the element to its right. Let's test this.\n\nFor the first column of Example 1: 3,0,1. Right neighbor of 3 is 0, so min(3,0)=0. Right neighbor of 0 is 1, so min(0,1)=0. But in the output, it's 3,0,1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum of itself and its right neighbor. For the first column: max(3,0)=3, max(0,1)=1. But the output is 3,0,1, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of the output as being constructed by some kind of transformation where certain elements are copied over or shifted based on the input's pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves some kind of symmetry, where the output grid is a rotated or mirrored version of the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the input is:\n\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nWait, no, the output in Example 1 seems to be a 6x6 grid, which is inconsistent with the input being 3x3. Maybe I misread the example. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid as well, but with some additional rows and columns filled with 3s or other values. For example, the output has six rows, each of six elements, but the input is only three rows and three columns. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the output is a 6x6 grid, but the input is 3x3, so that would make sense.\n\nBut in the example, the output is given as a 3x3 grid with some filled rows and columns. Wait, perhaps the output is a 6x6 grid, but it's not shown here, but the problem statement says to predict the corresponding output grid. So maybe I should focus on the given examples and try to find a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the rule involves some kind of interaction between rows and columns, where certain elements are copied over or transformed based on their neighbors.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each element in the output is the sum of the element and its right neighbor in the input. So for each element, output = input + right neighbor. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nFirst column: 3 + 0 = 3, 0 + 2 = 2, 1 + 3 = 4. But the output in Example 1 is 3,0,1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, output = min(input, right neighbor). For the first column: 3 vs 0, min is 0; 0 vs 2, min is 0; 1 vs 3, min is 1. But the output is 3,0,1, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each element in the output is the average of the element and its right neighbor. For the first column: (3 + 0)/2 = 1.5, but the output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to look for a pattern in the output grids and see if I can deduce the rule based on that.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output is a 6x6 grid, but the input is 3x3. So perhaps the output is a duplication of the input across multiple rows and columns. For example, the first row of the input might be duplicated three times to form the first three rows of the output, and similarly for the columns. But looking at the output, the first row is all 3s, which matches the first row of the input. The second row of the input is 0,2,2, which becomes 0,2,2,2,2,0 in the output. So it's like repeating the row twice and adding the middle elements in between. Similarly, the third row of the input is 1,1,0, which becomes 1,1,0,0,1,1.\n\nThis seems to suggest that each row in the output is formed by repeating the corresponding row in the input three times, but with the middle elements duplicated. For example, the second row of the input is 0,2,2. In the output, it's 0,2,2,2,2,0. So the first three elements are the input row, the next three are the middle elements duplicated, and the last three are the input row again.\n\nIf this pattern holds, then the rule would be that each row in the output is formed by taking the corresponding row in the input, repeating it three times, but with the middle elements duplicated. Similarly, the columns would be formed by taking the corresponding column in the input, repeating it three times, but with the middle elements duplicated.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1.\n\nInput rows:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nOutput rows:\n0,2,2,2,2,0\n1,1,0,0,1,1\n1,1,0,0,1,1\n0,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,3,3\n\nWait, no, the output in Example 1 is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nWhich matches this pattern. Each row is the corresponding input row repeated three times, with the middle elements duplicated.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row in the output, repeat the corresponding row in the input three times, and between the repetitions, include the middle elements of the input row.\n\nApplying this rule to Example 2 and Example 3 would confirm if it fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is a 3x2 grid:\n\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nThe output is a 3x3 grid:\n\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n\nLet's see if this fits the rule.\n\nTake the first row of the input: 3,3,1. According to the rule, the output row should be 3,3,1, repeated three times with the middle elements duplicated. But since the input row is length 3, the output row would be:\n\n3,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,1 \u2192 but that's 9 elements, but the output row is 6 elements. So perhaps the rule is only applied to the non-empty columns.\n\nWait, this suggests that the rule applies to the non-empty columns, so for each column, we take the repeated row and duplicate the middle elements. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has columns 1,2,3.\n\nFor column 1: input is 3,1,0. According to the rule, the output column would be 3,1,0,3,1,0,3,1,0 \u2192 but the output column is 3,1,3,1,0,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is applied differently. Maybe for each row in the input, we create a new row in the output by repeating the row three times and duplicating the middle elements.\n\nFor example, the first row in Example 2 is 3,3,1. Repeating it three times would give 3,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,1. But the output for column 1 is 3,1,3,1,0,2. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each row in the output is formed by taking the corresponding row in the input, and for each element in the output row, it's the corresponding element in the input row, with the middle elements duplicated. For example, for a row in the input with length N, the output row would have 2*N elements, where the first N elements are the input row, followed by the middle N-2 elements duplicated, and then the last N-2 elements.\n\nWait, that might be it. But let's test this with Example 1.\n\nInput row: 3,3,3. Output row: 3,3,3,3,3,3. So the input row is repeated three times, matching the output.\n\nFor the second row of Example 1: 0,2,2.

The first three rows of the input are 3,3,3; 0,2,2; and 1,1,0. The output has these rows repeated three times. So each row in the input is copied three times to form the output.\n\nLet me test this with Example 2.\n\nInput Grid:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput Grid:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nAgain, the output is repeating each row of the input three times. The output starts with the first row, then the second, then the first again, then the third, then the second, then the first. This pattern is consistent with the first example.\n\nNow, checking Example 3:\n\nInput Grid:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\n\nOutput Grid:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\nSame pattern here. Each row of the input is repeated twice in the output. The output has two rows of each input row. So, the first row of the input is copied twice, then the second, then the first again, and finally the third.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the output seems to have some rows repeated twice, but not exactly three. Let me count the output rows:\n\n- First row: 2 1 0 0 1 2 (6 elements)\n- Second row: 0 2 3 3 2 0 (6 elements)\n- Third row: 0 3 0 0 3 0 (6 elements)\n- Fourth row: 0 3 0 0 3 0 (same as third)\n- Fifth row: 0 2 3 3 2 0 (same as second)\n- Sixth row: 2 1 0 0 1 2 (same as first)\n\nSo, the output is the first row, then the second, then the first again, then the third, then the second, then the first. It's a cycle of the three rows, each appearing twice.\n\nPutting this all together, the rule is: each row in the input grid is repeated twice in the output grid, in the order they appear, then the entire process is repeated again. So, the output grid is constructed by taking each row of the input, duplicating it, and appending these duplicated rows in sequence.\n\nI should double-check this with another example, but since the rules are consistent across all provided examples, I'm confident this is the correct pattern.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's look at each input row and see what changes occur in the output.\n\nTake the first example's input:\n\nRow 1: 3 3 3\nRow 2: 0 2 2\nRow 3: 1 1 0\n\nAnd the output rows are:\n\nOutput Row 1: 3,3,3,3,3,3\nOutput Row 2: 0,2,2,2,2,0\nOutput Row 3: 1,1,0,0,1,1\nOutput Row 4: 1,1,0,0,1,1\nOutput Row 5: 0,2,2,2,2,0\nOutput Row 6: 3,3,3,3,3,3\n\nWait, that seems a bit odd because Rows 3 and 4 are the same as Rows 1 and 2. Why? Maybe there's symmetry or some pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is a mirrored version of the input rows, or perhaps it's a transformation where each element is replaced by a certain value based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Output Row 2: 0,2,2,2,2,0\n\nThis seems to be similar to the input Row 2, which is 0,2,2, but then extended with 2,2,0. Wait, but in the output, it's 0,2,2,2,2,0. So the first and last elements are 0, and the middle four are 2s. But the input Row 2 is length 3, so how does this extend? Maybe it's some kind of padding or mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each element in the output is determined by some function of the input elements. For example, maybe each output element is the sum, product, or some other operation of the input elements in a specific row or column.\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the corresponding elements from each input row and applying a transformation, then concatenating them.\n\nLooking at Output Row 2: 0,2,2,2,2,0\n\nLet me see what each element in Output Row 2 corresponds to in the input.\n\nFirst element: 0\nSecond element: 2\nThird element: 2\nFourth element: 2\nFifth element: 2\nSixth element: 0\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow 1: 3,3,3\nRow 2: 0,2,2\nRow 3: 1,1,0\n\nHmm, perhaps each element in Output Row 2 is derived from the sum of the corresponding elements in the rows of the input. Let's check.\n\nFor the first element in Output Row 2 (0), perhaps it's the sum of 0 (from Row 2) and 1 (from Row 3), which is 1. But that doesn't give 0. Alternatively, maybe it's the difference or some other operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element is determined by the input row's elements in a way that is linear or follows some pattern.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe each output row is formed by applying a transformation to each input row, then combining the results in some way.\n\nFor example, in Output Row 2: 0,2,2,2,2,0.\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow 1: 3,3,3\n\nRow 2: 0,2,2\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0\n\nMaybe each element in Output Row 2 is the result of some operation on the corresponding input rows. For instance, perhaps it's the minimum of the corresponding elements, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps each output element is determined by the corresponding element in the input row, but in a mirrored way.\n\nFor example, in Output Row 2: 0,2,2,2,2,0.\n\nThe first and last elements are 0, which might correspond to the first and last elements of some input row. The middle elements are 2, which might correspond to the middle elements of another input row.\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the elements from the input rows in a specific order and then applying some transformation.\n\nLooking at Output Row 2: 0,2,2,2,2,0.\n\nThis seems to be 0, then 2, then 2, then 2, then 2, then 0.\n\nIf I look at the input rows:\n\nRow 1: 3,3,3\n\nRow 2: 0,2,2\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0\n\nMaybe the first element of Output Row 2 is the minimum of Row 1 and Row 3, which are 3 and 1, so 1. That doesn't match 0. Alternatively, maybe it's the minimum of Row 2 and Row 3, which are 0 and 1, giving 0. That matches.\n\nThen, the second element is perhaps the maximum of Row 2 and Row 3, which are 2 and 1, giving 2. That matches.\n\nThird element is the same as the second, 2.\n\nFourth element also 2.\n\nFifth element is again 2.\n\nSixth element is the minimum of Row 2 and Row 3, which is 0.\n\nSo yes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo the rule is: for each output row, the elements are determined by taking, for each position, the minimum of the corresponding elements from the input rows, then concatenating them.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nWait, in Output Row 2: 0,2,2,2,2,0.\n\nThe first element is min(3,1) = 1, but it's 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the maximum of the corresponding elements.\n\nWait, in Output Row 2, the first element is 0, which is the minimum of Row 2 (0) and Row 3 (1). So maybe it's the minimum of the input rows.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nFor the first element of Output Row 2: 0, which is the minimum of Row 2 (0) and Row 3 (1).\n\nSecond element: 2, which is the maximum of Row 2 (2) and Row 3 (1). Wait, no, because the maximum of 2 and 1 is 2, which matches.\n\nThird element is 2, same as second.\n\nFourth is 2.\n\nFifth is 2.\n\nSixth is 0, which is the minimum of Row 2 and Row 3.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for each output row, each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in the input rows, but only for the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth elements, and the second, third, and seventh elements are determined by some other function.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try to find another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is a combination of the input rows in a certain way. For example, each output row is created by taking elements from the input rows in a specific order and combining them.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's look at the second example to see if the rule is consistent.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nHmm, the output has 6 rows, each with 6 elements. Let's examine the first output row: 3,3,1,1,3,3.\n\nThis seems to be formed by taking elements from the input rows in some pattern. Let's see:\n\nInput Row 1: 3,3,1\n\nInput Row 2:1,3,0\n\nInput Row 3:0,2,2\n\nWait, maybe each output element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in the input rows. Let's check:\n\nFor the first element of Output Row 1: 3 (from Row 1). That matches.\n\nSecond element: 3 (from Row 1) and 3 (from Row 2) and 2 (from Row 3). Maximum is 3, which matches.\n\nThird element:1 (Row1),0 (Row2),2 (Row3). Maximum is 2, but Output Row 1 third element is 1, which doesn't match.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the elements in the input rows. Let's see:\n\nFor Output Row 1: 3+3+1=7, 1+3+0=4, 0+2+2=4. Sum is 7,4,4. But the output is 3,3,1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps each output element is determined by some bitwise operation, like AND or OR.\n\nFor the first element: 3 & 1 = 1, but in Output Row 1, it's 3. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to binary representations or some other encoding.\n\nWait, another approach: let's consider the output rows and see if they follow a pattern.\n\nLooking at the first output row of Example 2: 3,3,1,1,3,3.\n\nThis seems to be 3,3,1, then 1,3,3. Maybe it's a pattern where the first three are the same as the first row, then the next three are the second row, and then the third row is overlapped.\n\nWait, but the third row is 0,2,2, which doesn't match the first row. So that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is a combination of the input rows, where each element is determined by a specific rule.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern by looking at the first output row of Example 2: 3,3,1,1,3,3.\n\nThis seems to be 3,3,1, then 1,3,3. Maybe it's the first row of the input concatenated with itself, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the first row of the input is 3,3,1. The output row is 3,3,1,1,3,3. So the first three are the first row, then the next three are the second row. Let's check:\n\nSecond row of input:1,3,0.\n\nThird row:0,2,2.\n\nSo if Output Row 1 is first row, then second row, then first row again, that would make sense.\n\nBut let's check the second output row of Example 2:1,3,0,0,3,1.\n\nWhich is first row, second row, third row.\n\nThird output row:0,2,2,2,2,0.\n\nWhich is third row, third row, first row.\n\nWait, but in the output, the third row is 0,2,2,2,2,0, which is third row, third row, first row. So that seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth output row is 0,2,2,2,2,0, same as the third.\n\nFifth output row:1,3,0,0,3,1, same as second.\n\nSixth output row:3,3,1,1,3,3, same as first.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output rows are six in total, and the first three are the first row, second, third. Then the fourth is the third, third, first. Then fifth is second, second, third. Then sixth is first, first, second. Wait, but in the example, the output is:\n\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nSo the fourth output row is the third row, third row, first row: 0,2,2,0,2,2,0, but the output shows 0,2,2,2,2,0. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps my assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by taking the corresponding elements from the input rows, but in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the elements from the input rows in a specific order, like row 1, row 2, row 3, row 1, row 2, row 3, etc.\n\nWait, looking at Output Row 1:3,3,1,1,3,3.\n\nThis seems to be the first row, then the second row, then the third row, but the third row is 0,2,2, which doesn't match the output. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the elements from the input rows in a certain way, such as combining them in a specific order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the minimum of each element across the input rows, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps each output element is determined by the corresponding element in the input rows, but in a specific pattern.\n\nWait, another approach: let's consider the second example and see if the rule is consistent.\n\nIn Example 2, the first output row is 3,3,1,1,3,3.\n\nLooking at the input:\n\nRow1:3,3,1\n\nRow2:1,3,0\n\nRow3:0,2,2\n\nIf I take the first row, then the second row, then the third row, but in a way that each output element is determined by the first, second, and third rows in a cyclic manner.\n\nWait, perhaps each output element is determined by the first, second, and third rows in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is the minimum of the corresponding row's element.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor Output Row 1:3,3,1,1,3,3.\n\nFirst element is 3, which is the maximum of Row1's 3, Row2's 1, and Row3's 0. Hmm, no, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps each output element is determined by the minimum of the corresponding positions in the input rows, but only for certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the elements from the input rows, but in a way that repeats the input rows every two output rows.\n\nWait, in Example 2, Output Row 1 is first row, second row, third row.\n\nOutput Row 2 is third row, third row, first row.\n\nOutput Row 3 is second row, second row, first row.\n\nOutput Row 4 is third row, third row, first row.\n\nOutput Row 5 is second row, second row, first row.\n\nOutput Row 6 is first row, first row, second row.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the output rows are formed by taking the input rows in a cyclic manner, but the order depends on the row number modulo 3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor Output Row 1: row1, row2, row3.\n\nOutput Row 2: row3, row3, row1.\n\nOutput Row3: row2, row2, row1.\n\nOutput Row4: row3, row3, row1.\n\nOutput Row5: row2, row2, row1.\n\nOutput Row6: row1, row1, row2.\n\nSo yes, this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo the rule is: for each output row, it's formed by taking the input rows in a specific order, cycling every three rows.\n\nThe order is:\n\nOutput Row 1: row1, row2, row3\n\nOutput Row 2: row3, row3, row1\n\nOutput Row3: row2, row2, row1\n\nOutput Row4: row3, row3, row1\n\nOutput Row5: row2, row2, row1\n\nOutput Row6: row1, row1, row2\n\nSo, now, applying this rule to the second example, which is:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput rows are as given.\n\nNow, applying this rule, let's see how each output row is formed.\n\nFor Output Row 1: row1, row2, row3.\n\nSo row1:3,3,1\n\nrow2:1,3,0\n\nrow3:0,2,2\n\nSo concatenated, it's 3,3,1,1,3,0,0,2,2.\n\nBut the output Row 1 is ", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's look at the examples provided to identify any patterns or rules.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nHmm, the output seems to have some symmetry. Each row in the input becomes the same in the output, so maybe it's a row-wise transformation. Let me check each row of the input.\n\nFirst row of input is all 3s, and the output is all 3s. That fits. The second row is 0,2,2. The output is 0,2,2 repeated three times. Similarly, the third row is 1,1,0, which becomes 1,1,0 repeated three times. The fourth and fifth rows are the same as the third, and the sixth is the same as the first. So it looks like each row in the input is copied multiple times in the output, specifically three times each.\n\nWait, but in the output, each row is 6 elements long, which is three times three. So each row in the input is expanded into three rows in the output. But looking at the output, each row in the input becomes three rows in the output, each being the same as the original row. So for example, the first row of input (3,3,3) becomes three rows, each being 3,3,3. Similarly, the second row (0,2,2) becomes three rows, each 0,2,2.\n\nWait, no, in the output, each row is replicated. Let's count the number of rows in the output. The input has 3 rows, and the output has 6 rows, which is double. That suggests that each row is duplicated twice.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me count again. The input has 3 rows, and the output has 6 rows. So each row is duplicated. But in the output, each row is a copy of the original row. So for example, the first row of input is 3,3,3, and in the output, it appears three times, each as a full row.\n\nWait, but in the output, the first row is 3,3,3, followed by 0,2,2, etc., but it's actually six rows, each being the same as the input row. So for example, the first row is 3,3,3, and it appears three times in the output. Similarly, the second row of input is 0,2,2, which appears three times.\n\nWait, but in the output, the first row is 3,3,3, the second row is 0,2,2, and then the third row is 1,1,0, and then the fourth row is 1,1,0, and fifth row is 0,2,2, sixth row is 3,3,3. So it's arranging the rows of the input in a specific order, perhaps in a certain sequence, and each row is repeated three times.\n\nLooking at the second example to verify:\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nEach row of the input is repeated three times, and the order is first row, second, third, then third, second, first. So the output is arranged as:\n\nRow1 repeated three times,\nRow2 repeated three times,\nRow3 repeated three times,\nRow3 twice, then Row2 twice, then Row1 twice.\n\nWait, in the output, it's 3 3 1, then 1 3 0, then 0 2 2, then 0 2 2, 1 3 0, 3 3 1. So it's Row1, Row2, Row3, Row3, Row2, Row1.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\nAgain, each row of the input is repeated three times, arranged in the order Row1, Row2, Row3, then Row3, Row2, Row1.\n\nSo the rule is: For each row in the input, create three copies of that row in the output, in the order Row1, Row2, Row3, Row3, Row2, Row1.\n\nTherefore, the transformation function is:\n\nFor each row R in the input grid:\n- Append R three times to the output grid.\n- Then append Row2 three times.\n- Then append Row3 three times.\n\nSo, applying this to the given input grid:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nApplying the rule:\nFirst row: 1 1 0 repeated three times \u2192 1 1 0 | 1 1 0 | 1 1 0\nSecond row: 0 3 2 repeated three times \u2192 0 3 2 | 0 3 2 | 0 3 2\nThird row: 3 3 0 repeated three times \u2192 3 3 0 | 3 3 0 | 3 3 0\n\nThen, arrange them as Row1, Row2, Row3, Row2, Row1, Row1.\n\nWait, no, the arrangement is Row1, Row2, Row3, Row3, Row2, Row1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nSo the output grid is a 6x3 grid, with each row being the same three times, arranged in the order Row1, Row2, Row3, Row2, Row1.\n\nI think that's the rule.\n</think>", -0.25], ["10", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Looking at Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is also 6x6. Hmm, so the output grid is twice as large as the input grid. That's interesting.\n\nLet me write down the input and output to see if I can spot a pattern:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. The output should be 6x6, but it's shown as multiple lines. Wait, maybe each cell in the input corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the first cell in the input, which is 3. In the output, the first two rows and columns are 3, and the next two rows and columns are 0, 2, 2. That doesn't seem consistent. Maybe each cell in the input maps to four cells in the output, but that might not fit either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the input is replicated in the output grid in a way that forms a 2x2 block. But in Example 1, the output is a 6x6 grid, which is 3 times 2. Maybe the rule is that each cell in the input is copied to multiple cells in the output, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me look at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 1\n1 3 0\n0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n1 3 0 0 3 1\n3 3 1 1 3 3\n\nAgain, the output is 6x6. It seems that each row of the input is being extended by adding the same elements on either side. For example, the first row of input is 3 3 1, and in the output, each element is duplicated, resulting in 3 3 1 1 3 3. That might be the rule: for each cell, its value is repeated to form a 2x2 block in the output.\n\nIf that's the case, then applying this rule to the third example:\n\nInput:\n2 1 0\n0 2 3\n0 3 0\n\nOutput:\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 1 0 0 1 2\n\nWait, the output here is 6x6, but the input is 3x3. So each row in the input is extended into two rows in the output, each of which is the same elements duplicated. For example, the first row of input is 2 1 0, so in the output, it's duplicated into two rows: 2 1 0 0 1 2 and 0 2 3 3 2 0. The second row of input is 0 2 3, which becomes 0 2 3 3 2 0 and 0 3 0 0 3 0, and the third row is 0 3 0, which becomes 0 3 0 0 3 0 and 0 2 3 3 2 0.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input grid:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nOutput:\n1 1 0 0 1 2\n0 3 2 3 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 2 3 3 2 0\n2 2 0 0 2 2\n\nWait, no, maybe each row is duplicated, and each element is duplicated. So for each row in the input, which is 3 elements, the output will have 6 elements, each being the same as the original, but duplicated. For example, the first row is 1 1 0, so in the output, it's 1 1 0 1 1 0. Wait, but in the test input, it's 1 1 0, so the output should be 1 1 0 1 1 0, but in the previous examples, the output is longer. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell is repeated in both rows and columns, forming a 2x2 block. For example, the first cell in the input, which is 1, is followed by another 1, then 0, and then 0, 1, 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each cell, the value is copied to the same position in both the upper and lower parts of the output grid. So for each cell in the input, its value is present twice in the output grid, once in the upper half and once in the lower half.\n\nBut looking at Example 1, the first row of input is 3 3 3. The output's first two rows are 3 3 3 3 3 3, which suggests that each 3 is copied to both halves. Similarly, the second row of input is 0 2 2, which in the output becomes 0 2 2 2 2 0. So each element is duplicated.\n\nSo the rule is: for each cell in the input, its value is copied twice in the output grid, once in the upper half and once in the lower half. Therefore, the output grid is formed by duplicating each row of the input grid into two rows, each containing the original elements twice.\n\nApplying this to the test input grid:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nThe output should be six rows, each being a duplication of a row from the input, with each element copied twice. So for the first row, 1 1 0 becomes 1 1 0 1 1 0. Similarly, the second row 0 3 2 becomes 0 3 2 0 3 2. The third row 3 3 0 becomes 3 3 0 3 3 0.\n\nTherefore, the output grid is:\n\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n\nBut wait, the test input has 3 rows, so the output should have 6 rows. Each row from the input is duplicated, so 3 input rows become 6 output rows. Each output row is the input row duplicated twice.\n\nSo the final output grid would be:\n\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n3 3 0 3 3 0\n0 3 2 0 3 2\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the first row of the input is 3 3 3, so the output's first two rows are 3 3 3 3 3 3. Similarly, the second row of input is 0 2 2, so the output's next two rows are 0 2 2 2 2 0. The third row of input is 1 1 0, so the output's next two rows are 1 1 0 1 1 0 and 1 1 0 1 1 0. Wait, no, in the sample output, the third row is 1 1 0 0 1 1, which doesn't match. So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the input row is 3 3 3, and the output's first two rows are 3 3 3 3 3 3. That suggests that each element is copied twice, so 3 is duplicated to form 3 3 3 3 3 3. Similarly, the second input row is 0 2 2, which in the output is 0 2 2 2 2 0. So each element is duplicated.\n\nTherefore, the rule is to take each row of the input and duplicate each element twice, appending the same elements again. So for each row in the input, create two new rows in the output, each being the elements of the input row repeated twice.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0\n0 3 2\n3 3 0\n\nOutput would be:\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 1 0\nRow 2: 0 3 2 0 3 2\nRow 3: 3 3 0 3 3 0\nRow 4: 3 3 0 3 3 0\nRow 5: 0 3 2 0 3 2\nRow 6: 1 1 0 1 1 0\n\nSo the final output is the same as the input, but each row is duplicated, resulting in six rows.\n</think>", -0.25]]}
