The task is to find a common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid based on the given examples. Once we understand the rule, we can apply it to the provided test input grid.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first example to identify any patterns or rules. The input grid is a 15x15 matrix, and the output is also a 15x15 matrix. Let's compare each cell in the input with the corresponding cell in the output to see if there's a consistent transformation.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output, I notice that the output grid has a lot of zeros except for certain positions. This suggests that the rule might involve some kind of accumulation or transformation that doesn't affect most cells. For instance, in the first output row, the first few cells have 1s, but others have 0s. This indicates that the rule might involve some conditional logic based on the values of neighboring cells or the sum of certain groups.\n\nAnother observation is that in the first example, the output grid has a lot of zeros, which could mean that the rule is subtracting certain values or leaving groups of cells untouched. For example, perhaps the rule is to sum the values in certain regions and then replace those sums with specific values, but most cells remain 0.\n\nLet's consider the second example. The input grid is larger, and the output grid has a similar pattern of zeros with some 1s and 6s. Comparing the second and third rows in the output, I see that the 1s and 6s in the output are positioned in a way that might correspond to the 1s and 6s in the output of the first example. This suggests that the rule is consistent across different input grids.\n\nIn the third example, the output grid has a lot of zeros, but there are some 1s and 2s that appear in the same positions as in the first two examples. This further supports the idea that the rule is general and not grid-specific.\n\nNow, focusing on the first example, I notice that certain rows and columns in the output have distinct patterns. For example, the first few rows in the output have 1s in the first few cells, which might indicate that the rule involves incrementing these values or setting them to 1 under certain conditions.\n\nLooking at the third row of the output, I see that it has two 1s followed by zeros. This could mean that two specific cells are being set to 1, possibly when certain conditions are met in the corresponding input rows.\n\nTo generalize, I think the rule involves aggregating the values in certain cells and setting specific regions to 1. For instance, maybe the rule is to sum the values in specific regions and then set those regions to 1 based on the sum's magnitude. Alternatively, it might involve subtracting the sum from a certain value to get a 1 or 0.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule involves checking the value of each cell in the input and setting it to 1 if the sum of certain neighboring cells meets a specific condition. For example, if the sum of a cell and its adjacent cells is above a threshold, the output cell becomes 1.\n\nLooking at the first row of the output, which has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The value 1 appears at the 5th and 6th positions. This could mean that these positions are being set to 1 when the sum of certain cells is 2 or more.\n\nSimilarly, in the second row of the output, the 1s appear at different positions, but this gives me a clue that the rule might involve setting specific cells to 1 based on the sum of their neighbors.\n\nConsidering all these observations, I hypothesize that the rule involves summing the values in a specific region of the input grid and then setting the corresponding cells in the output grid to 1 if the sum meets or exceeds a certain threshold, and 0 otherwise.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I can look at the third row of the output, which has two 1s. This suggests that two specific cells are being set to 1, which might correspond to a sum of 2. Therefore, the rule could be: for each cell in the output grid, if the sum of the corresponding input cells in a specific neighborhood is >= 2, set the output cell to 1; otherwise, set it to 0.\n\nI'll apply this rule to the second example to verify. Looking at the second example's input, I'll compute the sum of the corresponding cells in the neighborhood and see if any cells in the output match the rule. For instance, in the first row of the output, the first cell is 0, which suggests that the sum of the corresponding cells is less than 2. Similarly, the second cell is 0, and the third cell is 0, which also aligns with this idea.\n\nOnce the rule is solidified, I can apply it to the test input grid provided, applying the same logic to each cell to determine the correct output.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

It looks like the rule might involve some kind of counting or summing of the surrounding cells.\n\nIn Example 2, the input starts with a bunch of zeros, then some non-zeros, and then mostly zeros again. The output has a 1 where the input had non-zeros, but also some zeros and higher numbers. The 1s might indicate a count of something, like how many non-zero cells are in a certain area.\n\nExample 3 is a bit more complex. The input has some patterns, and the output has higher numbers, like 6s and 2s, and some 0s. The 6s might be the result of summing multiple non-zero cells, and the 2s could be counts of specific patterns.\n\nPutting it together, it seems like the rule involves summing certain cells in specific regions. For example, in the first output row, the 1s might correspond to having exactly two non-zero cells in a particular 3x3 area. The 6s could be sums of larger regions, like three 3x3 areas.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the initial output has a lot of zeros except for some 1s. That might mean that in the first few 3x3 regions, there's exactly one non-zero cell, which sums to 1. Then, as the regions grow, the sum increases, leading to higher numbers.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s where the input had non-zero, but also 6s. Maybe the 6s represent the sum of all non-zero cells in a 3x3 area. So, if a 3x3 area has, say, four non-zero cells, the sum would be 4, which could be higher than 6. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe it's the count of non-zero cells, but in Example 1, the count was 2, leading to a 1. Wait, no, in Example 1, the output was 1 where the input had two non-zero cells. So perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output grid counts how many non-zero cells are in the corresponding 3x3 region, but then maybe it's normalized or summed differently.\n\nWait, in the first output row of Example 1, the first few cells are 1, which might correspond to regions where there's exactly one non-zero cell. So perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output grid is the number of non-zero cells in a 3x3 window centered on that cell. But in Example 1, the input is sparse, so the sums are low.\n\nLooking at the output grid, the 1s are in the top-left part, which suggests that the 3x3 regions there have exactly one non-zero cell. Then, as we move to the right, the 1s might continue to exist in areas where the non-zero cells are further out. But the 0s in the output might indicate that the window had no non-zero cells, or perhaps the window was larger than the input, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has 1s where the input was non-zero, but also 6s. So maybe the rule is that each output cell counts the number of non-zero cells in a 3x3 window, but without adding them. For example, if a window has two non-zero cells, it might be represented as 1 (if it's the first cell in a group) or 2. But in Example 1, the 1s might correspond to windows with exactly one non-zero cell, and 6s might correspond to windows with more than one non-zero cell, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the non-zero cells divided by the number of non-zero cells, but that doesn't fit either. Maybe it's the count of non-zero cells in each 3x3 window, but in Example 1, the output is mostly zeros except for 1s, suggesting that each cell is either 0 or the count in its window.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output, the first row is all 0s except for the first few cells. Let me think of a 3x3 window. For the first cell, if there's only one non-zero cell in a 3x3 window, it might be 1. But if a 3x3 window has two non-zero cells, and they are in the same row or column, perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each 3x3 window sums the values of the non-zero cells, but if there are multiple non-zero cells, it takes the maximum or something. But in the output, I don't see any 1s except in specific positions.\n\nWait, in the first output row, the first few cells are 1s. Let me think of a 3x3 window starting at (0,0). If the input has non-zero cells at (0,0) and (0,3), then the sum would be 2, but the output is 1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's the count of non-zero cells, so 1 for a window with one non-zero, which works for the first part, but then in Example 1, the output has 1s in the first few cells, but later 0s.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each 3x3 window is summed, but any zero in the window is counted as zero, and non-zero is added. So the sum can be more than 1, but in the output, the 1s might correspond to windows where the sum is 1. That doesn't seem to fit because the input has more non-zero cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output grid counts the number of non-zero cells in a 3x3 window centered on that cell, but the output is the sum of these counts, which could lead to higher numbers. But in Example 1, the output is mostly zeros except for 1s, suggesting that each cell is either 0 or 1. So perhaps the rule is that each cell is 1 if the window has at least one non-zero, and 0 otherwise. That would fit the first few 1s and 0s.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 1s in the first few cells, which would be consistent with a 1 if the window has at least one non-zero. But later, when the window has more non-zero cells, it still outputs 1. That suggests that the output might be the count of non-zero cells, but then the first output row shows 1s in cells where the count is 1 or more.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell counts how many non-zero cells are in its 3x3 window, but the output is the count, not the sum. So in the first output row, some cells have 1s where the count is 1, and 0s where the count is 0. But in the example, the output has 1s and 0s, so maybe the output is the count, but the examples show that the output in Example 1's first row is mostly 0s, except for 1s. That can't be right because the count could be higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a binary representation, where 1 indicates if there's at least one non-zero in the window, and 0 otherwise. That would fit the first output row, which has 1s in the first few cells and 0s otherwise.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 1. Suppose the output is 1 if the window has at least one non-zero, else 0. Let's see if this fits the first few rows.\n\nIn the first output row, the first few cells are 1, which would mean that each of these cells has a 3x3 window with at least one non-zero. The input has non-zero cells in the first row, so their windows would include those non-zero cells, thus leading to 1s.\n\nThen, as we move to the right, the 1s might continue, but then in later rows, the 1s might turn into 2s or higher. Wait, in the first few rows of the first output, it's 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, etc. So maybe that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the count of non-zero cells in a 3x3 window, summed. So in the first window, it's one non-zero, so count is 1. Then, in a larger window, the count could be higher. But in the output, in Example 1, the first few rows have 1s, which would fit if the count is 1.\n\nWait, but in the first output row, the first few cells are 1, which would mean that in their respective 3x3 windows, there is at least one non-zero cell. That would fit the first few 1s. Then, as we go further, perhaps the count increases, but in the output, it still shows 1s.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me look at Example 2. In the input, there are non-zero cells in the first row, and the output shows a 1 in the first cell. Also, some cells in the output have higher numbers, like 6, which might correspond to the sum of non-zero cells in a larger window.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of non-zero cells in the 3x3 window, but each cell in the output represents a different aspect, like the number of such cells in each direction.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each output cell is the number of non-zero cells in the corresponding 3x3 window, but considering the surrounding cells. So, for example, each cell in the output counts how many non-zero cells are in a 3x3 square around that cell.\n\nIn Example 1, the first few rows of the output have 1s, which would correspond to cells where the 3x3 window has exactly one non-zero. Then, as we move right, perhaps the count increases, but the output shows 1s until a certain point, after which it turns into higher numbers.\n\nWait, in the output of Example 1, the first row has 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. That suggests that in some 3x3 windows, there is exactly one non-zero cell, and others have none. So the rule might be that each output cell is 1 if the corresponding 3x3 window has at least one non-zero, else 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the sum of the non-zero cells in the 3x3 window. So, if a window has one non-zero, it's 1; if it has two, it's 2, etc. But in Example 1, the output has 1s and 0s, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, in the first output row of Example 1, the first few cells are 1, which suggests that in their 3x3 windows, there's at least one non-zero. Then, as we move further, the 1s might continue, but perhaps after a certain point, the 1s turn into higher numbers like 2, 3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the count of non-zero cells in the 3x3 window, but each cell's count is represented as 1, 2, etc., not summed. So, for example, if a window has two non-zero cells, the output cell is 2, which would correspond to 1s and 2s in the output.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output shows 1s and 0s, which doesn't align with this interpretation.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to think about how to create the rule based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has non-zero cells in the first row, and the first output row has 1s in the first few cells, 0s in the next. So perhaps the rule is that each output cell is 1 if the corresponding 3x3 window has at least one non-zero, else 0. That would fit the first part.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a sparse pattern, and the output has 1s where the input had non-zero, and 6s where there are groups of non-zero cells. So perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the sum of all non-zero cells in the 3x3 window, but then divided by the number of non-zero cells or something. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is the number of non-zero cells in the 3x3 window, which could be 1, 2, etc., and that's what the output is showing.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has higher numbers like 6 and 2, which might correspond to larger windows having multiple non-zero cells.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the number of non-zero cells in the 3x3 window centered on it, but each output cell is represented as 1 if the count is at least one, else 0. No, because in Example 1, the output has 1s in the first few cells, which would mean that each of those cells has a 3x3 window with at least one non-zero.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the count of non-zero cells in a 3x3 window, but without summing. So, for example, a window with two non-zero cells would result in the output cell being 2. But in Example 1, the output has 1s in the first few cells, which would contradict that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is the number of non-zero cells in a 3x3 window, but the output is normalized by the maximum count, so that 1s are the result of having the maximum count, etc. That seems complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for another approach. Let me look at the output grid and see how it relates to the input grid.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros, and the output has 1s and 0s. The 1s might correspond to the presence of at least one non-zero in the 3x3 window. So the rule is: for each cell in the output, it's 1 if the 3x3 window around it in the input has at least one non-zero, otherwise 0.\n\nTesting this hypothesis: In the first row of the output, the first few cells are 1 because their 3x3 windows include non-zero cells. Then, as we move to the right, perhaps the 1s continue, but after a certain point, the window has no non-zero cells, so the 0s appear.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has non-zero cells scattered, and the output has 1s in those positions and 6s where there are larger groups of non-zero cells. So perhaps the rule is that the output cell is the sum of all non-zero cells in the 3x3 window, divided by the number of non-zero cells, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell counts how many non-zero cells are in the 3x3 window, but the output is represented as 1 if the count is at least one, 2 if two, etc. But in Example 1, the output has 1s in the first few cells, which would correspond to a count of one.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the number of non-zero cells in the 3x3 window, and then the output is normalized by dividing by the maximum count. That way, higher counts are scaled down to 1. But in Example 1, the first few cells have 1, which would be the maximum count, and the rest have 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of non-zero cells in the 3x3 window, represented as 1 if there's at least one, 2 if two, etc. But in Example 1, the output has 1s in the first few cells, which would fit, but then the rest would be higher numbers, which don't match the example's output.\n\nI'm still not sure. Maybe I should look at another example.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a more complex pattern, and the output has 1s in certain positions and 2s in others. The 2s might correspond to windows with two non-zero cells. So perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the count of non-zero cells in the 3x3 window, and the output shows 1 for 1, 2 for 2, etc.\n\nTesting this: in Example 1, the first few cells are 1 because their 3x3 windows have one non-zero. As we move right, the 1s might turn into 2s, but in the output, they are 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a binary representation where 1 indicates the presence of a non-zero in the window, and 0 otherwise. That way, the first few cells are 1s where the window has at least one non-zero, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has non-zero cells in the first row, second row, third row, etc., but the output has 1s in those positions and 6s where there are groups of non-zero cells. So if the rule is binary, the 1s would correspond to the presence of non-zero cells, and the 6s would be higher counts. But in Example 2, the output has 1s in the first few cells and 6s elsewhere, which would fit the binary model.\n\nBut in Example 3, the output has 1s and 2s, which would correspond to the count of non-zero cells in the window. So, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the number of non-zero cells in the 3x3 window, represented as 1, 2, etc.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the first output cell is 1, which means the window has one non-zero. Then, a few cells are 2, which would mean windows with two non-zero cells, and so on. So the rule might be that each output cell is the count of non-zero cells in the 3x3 window.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 1s in some", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples provided are a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first example, the input grid is a 25-element list, and the output is also a list. The output seems to have some 1s and 0s placed in specific positions. I notice that in the output, there are multiple 1s, like 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 and 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. These 1s are probably places where certain conditions are met in the input.\n\nThe input grid has a lot of zeros and threes, which suggests that maybe the rule involves counting how many non-zero elements or something similar. But the output isn't just zeros and threes; there are ones and zeros elsewhere. So perhaps the rule is more nuanced than just counting.\n\nLooking at the output, I see that in some rows, there are only zeros, and in others, there are a bunch of ones and zeros. For example, the first row of the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which means that in that particular row of the input, none of the positions meet the condition that would result in a 1.\n\nI notice that in the first example, the last few rows of the output have 1s, but the others are zeros. That implies that only certain rows in the input map to 1s in the output. So the rule must be that only when certain cells meet a condition, the output cell becomes 1, and otherwise, it's 0.\n\nLooking closer, I think the rule might involve counting the number of non-zero elements in certain regions. For example, in the last few rows of the input, there are a lot of threes, which might indicate that when a region has a high number of threes, it results in a 1 in the output.\n\nAnother observation is that in the output, the last few rows have 1s where the input has 3s. For example, the last row of the input has 3s in some positions, and the output has 1s. This suggests that whenever there are enough threes in a certain area, the output gets a 1.\n\nI also notice that the output grid has some 0s and 1s in a pattern that might be related to the input's structure. Maybe it's something like counting how many non-zero elements are in specific overlapping regions and setting a threshold.\n\nPutting this together, I think the rule is that for each cell in the output grid, we check the corresponding cells in the input grid. If certain patterns are found, we set the output cell to 1; otherwise, it's 0. The patterns are based on the non-zero elements and their arrangement in the input.\n\nTo confirm, I'll look at the second example. The input has a lot of threes and zeros, and the output has some 2s and 0s. This again supports the idea that the rule involves counting non-zero elements in specific areas.\n\nFinally, applying this rule to the test input grid provided, I can predict the output by checking each cell in the input and determining whether it contributes to a 1 in the output based on the observed patterns.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output are both 20-element grids. I notice that the output seems to have some patterns where certain cells are 1, 0, or another number. For example, in the output, some parts have 1s, and others have 0s. It looks like the rule involves some kind of grouping or transformation of the input's elements.\n\nLet me consider the first example. The input has a lot of zeros and a few 3s and 0s. The output also has a 1 in the first few positions, which probably corresponds to some criterion in the input. Maybe it's about the number of similar or adjacent elements?\n\nAnother approach is to look at how the input maps to the output. For instance, in the first output line, it's all zeros except the first few. That might mean that certain positions in the input don't contribute to the output, or contribute a 1 only under specific conditions.\n\nI also notice that in Example 1, the output has a 1 in the first position, then 0s, 1, 0s, and so on. This pattern suggests that the output is built by some function of the input, possibly a majority vote or some kind of aggregation.\n\nLet me think about the possible operations. Maybe it's about summing certain regions, or applying some filter. Since the output cells have values like 0, 1, 2, 6, and 1, perhaps it's a transformation where each cell is determined by some combination of its neighbors or itself.\n\nLooking at the third output line, the numbers 1 and 6 appear. That seems like it could be related to specific patterns in the input, such as isolated 3s or 0s. Maybe the 1s come from areas where there are multiple 0s or 3s, while 6s come from areas where there are multiple 3s.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has 1s and 2s. The input has 0s, 3s, and 2s. So perhaps the rule is that if a certain cell is part of a group of similar values, it becomes 1, and if it's part of a group of higher values, it becomes 2. Or maybe the opposite.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 0s except for some 1s and 2s. This suggests that the transformation depends on the surrounding cells. Maybe it's based on the majority in a neighborhood.\n\nI think I need to look for patterns in the examples. Let me take the first example and see how the output is generated.\n\nIn the first output line, the 1 appears only in the first few positions. Maybe this 1 is determined by a certain condition, like being a 3 in a specific area. But looking at the input, it's all zeros and 3s. So perhaps it's about the count of 3s in a window.\n\nWait, in the first input line, there are several 3s and zeros. The output has a 1 in the first few positions. Maybe the 1s correspond to regions that have more 3s than other values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are determined by the number of 0s in a window. But in the output, the first few are 1, which might not align with that.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the output has 1s where the input has 3s and 2s, but not zeros. Maybe the 1s are based on the count of non-zero values or something else.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to find a rule by comparing corresponding cells in the input and output. Let's take the first few elements of the input and output and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nInput: 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0\nOutput: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0\n\nWait, the output is 1s in the first few positions. So maybe the 1s are determined by some condition in the input, such as the presence of 3s or 0s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes 1 if it is surrounded by 3s in a certain way, or if it counts the number of 3s in its neighborhood and applies a threshold.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rule, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I should consider that the output is a transformation based on the input's elements, such as summing or applying some function to each cell.\n\nAnother idea is to look for the sum of certain cells. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in specific positions, which might correspond to the sum of specific parts of the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes 1 if it is part of a group of 3s, and 0 otherwise. But in the output, the first few are 1s, which might indicate that. But in the output, the first few are 0s, except for the first 1. Maybe it's the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a cell becomes 1 if it is a 3, and 0 otherwise. But that doesn't fit the output.\n\nWait, the first output line has 1s in the first few positions and then 0s. So perhaps it's based on a sliding window where a 1 is assigned if there's a certain number of 3s in a window of size 5 or something like that.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the output has 1s in cells where the input has 3s. So maybe the rule is that a cell is 1 if it contains a 3 in its neighborhood.\n\nBut in the output, the first line is all 0s, except some 1s. Maybe the 1s are determined by the majority in a 5-cell window.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the cell becomes 1 if it's part of a consecutive group of 3s, and 0 otherwise. But in Example 2, the output has 0s and 1s, suggesting that.\n\nI'm starting to think that the rule is based on the presence of 3s in a sliding window of size 5. So for each position, we look at the 5 cells around it and count how many are 3. If the count is above a certain threshold, say 3, then the output is 1; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nBut in the output, the first few are 1, then 0. So maybe it's a threshold of 2 or 3.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the first few positions. Maybe the threshold is 2. So for each position, if there are 2 or more 3s in the 5-cell window, it becomes 1; otherwise, 0.\n\nLooking at the first input line:\n\nInput: 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0\n\nIf we take a window of 5 cells, starting at position 0: 0,3,0,3,0 \u2192 2 threes \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nAt position 1: 3,0,3,0,0 \u2192 2 threes \u2192 1.\n\nPosition 2: 0,3,0,3,0 \u2192 2 threes \u2192 1.\n\nPosition 3: 3,0,3,0,0 \u2192 2 threes \u21921.\n\nPosition 4: 0,0,3,0,0 \u21921 three \u2192 0.\n\nWait, but the output's first few lines have 1s, so maybe it's not exactly that. Or perhaps the window is larger, like 3.\n\nWait, let me check Example 2. The input has some 3s and 0s, and the output has 1s where the input has 3s. So perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes 1 if it's part of a run of 3s, and 0 otherwise, but also considering the surrounding 0s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a cell is 1 if it's in a region surrounded by 0s and has a certain number of 3s nearby.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1, the first few are 0, then 1, then 0, then 1, etc. This suggests that perhaps the 1s are in positions where there are multiple 3s in the vicinity, but not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the sum of the input cells. If the sum is a certain value, maybe the output is 1, else 0.\n\nBut in Example 1, the sum of the input is a lot of 0s and 3s. Let's see:\n\nInput line 1: 0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0 \u2192 sum is 3+3+3=9.\n\nOutput line 1: sum is 0+0+0...+1=1? Wait, no, the output line is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0.\n\nWait, no, in the first output line, the first 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0. So sum is 1+1+1=3.\n\nHmm, not sure if sum is the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a cell becomes 1 if it's a 3 and has a 3 in the same row or column within a certain distance, but that seems vague.\n\nAnother idea is to look at how the input is transformed into the output in terms of the relative positions.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has 3s and 0s, and the output has 1s and 2s. Maybe the rule is that a cell becomes 1 if it's a 3, and 2 if it's a 2, and 0 otherwise, but that doesn't fit the output.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 2, the first line is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0. So it's 0 except for the first few, which are 1. That suggests that the 1s are in positions where the input has 3s.\n\nIn the input of Example 2, the first line is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.\n\nSo the 3 is at position 12. The output has 1s starting from position 0. So perhaps the rule is that a 3 becomes 1, and 0s remain 0.\n\nBut in the output, the first few are 1s, not zeros. So maybe it's the opposite: 0s become 1s, and other values remain.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has 0s in the first few positions, except for 1s. So perhaps when the input cell is 3, it becomes 1, else 0.\n\nBut in the output, the first few are 1s, which would correspond to the input having 3s. So maybe that's the rule: cell becomes 1 if input is 3, else 0.\n\nBut let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 0s, 3s, and 2s, and the output has 0s, 1s, and 2s. The output's first few are 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the first 0s remain 0, and then some 1s where the input had 3s. The 2s remain 2s, which suggests that perhaps the rule is that a cell is 1 if it's a 3, else 0, and 2s remain 2s.\n\nWait, but in the output, the 1s are in the same positions as the 3s in the input. So maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is 1 if the corresponding cell in the input is 3, else 0. That seems too simple, but it fits the examples.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output starts with 0s, then 1, 0, 0, etc. So it's 0s except for some 1s. If the rule is that 3\u21921, 0\u21920, 2\u21922, and others are 0, but in the input, there are 3s, 0s, and 2s. So maybe the output is a transformation where 3\u21921, 0\u21920, 2\u21922. But in the first output line, it's 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0. So only some 1s, not all.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is more complex, like counting the number of 3s in the neighborhood and applying a threshold.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the output is derived by looking at regions of 3s and setting 1s where they are present, else 0s.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s in positions where the output is 1. So perhaps that's the rule: if the input has at least one 3 in a region, set the output as 1; else 0.\n\nBut in the output, the first few are 1s, which correspond to the input having 3s. So maybe the rule is that a cell becomes 1 if it is part of a 3-connected region, else 0.\n\nBut let me check Example 2. The input line is 0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nThe output line is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nSo the 3s are in positions that are part of a 3-connected region, and the output is 1s for those positions. But the output also has some 1s where the input has 0s, which contradicts the rule.\n\nWait, no, the output has 0s except for the 1s in the first few positions. So perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes 1 if it's a 3 and is part of a 3-connected region, else 0.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output's first few are 1s, which correspond to the input's 3s. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 1s in positions where the input has 3s, and 2s where the input has 2s, and 0s elsewhere. So perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes 1 if it's a 3, 2 if it's a 2, else 0.\n\nWait, let's see Example 3's output. The first few are 0s, then 1s, then 2s, then 0s. The input has 3s, 2s, and 0s. So the output would have 1s where the input has 3s, 2s where the input has 2s, and 0s elsewhere. That fits the output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the output has 1s where the input has 3s, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s where the input has 3s, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: for each cell, if the input cell is 3, the output is 1; if it's 2, the output is 2; else, it's 0. Does this hold?\n\nWait, let me check the third example's input and output:\n\nInput line 1: 0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0 \u2192 output: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n\nSo the third, fourth, and ninth cells are 3, so output is 1s.\n\nIn the input line 2: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 output: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nSo the first three 3s in row 2 result in 1s in the output. That aligns with the rule.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 1s where the input has 3s and 2s where the input has 2s.\n\nSo the rule is: for each cell, if the input is 3, output is 1; if the input is 2, output is 2; else, output is 0.\n\nThis seems to fit all the examples.\n\nNow, let me apply this rule to the second example's input and output to see if it holds.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully examining the examples to see if I can spot any patterns or connections between the input and output.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and a few non-zero numbers, and the output seems to have some non-zero values. For instance, the first input row has a single 3 and a 3 in the middle, but the output doesn't have a 3 there. Instead, it has 1s and 0s. Similarly, the second input row also has non-zeros, but the output has 0s except in the last few positions.\n\nI notice that the output grid has a lot of zeros, which suggests that the rule might involve some form of averaging or counting non-zero elements in specific regions. Maybe it's a matter of summing the non-zero values in certain areas of the input and then distributing those sums across the output grid.\n\nLet me take a closer look at the first example. The input grid has a row with a single 3 and a 3 in the middle. The output row has 1s in the first and third positions. That doesn't directly correspond to the sum of 6, but perhaps it's the count of non-zero elements. Wait, no, because the output has two 1s there.\n\nWait, maybe it's the count of non-zero elements that are not adjacent. Or perhaps it's the number of times a non-zero appears in a certain pattern. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the non-zero elements divided by the size of the grid, but that seems less likely.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the second example. In the first input row, there are multiple non-zero elements, and the output has some 1s and 0s. For example, the first output row has 1s where the input has a single non-zero. That suggests that each non-zero in the input contributes to a 1 in the output.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first input row has two 3s and a 3 in the middle. The output row shows 1, 1, 0, etc. So maybe each 3 contributes to a 1 in the output. But the output has only two 1s, which might mean that some contributions are being normalized.\n\nLooking at the third example, the input has several 3s and 0s, and the output has non-zero values that seem to be sums of the non-zero elements in certain regions. For instance, in the first output row, there are 0s except for 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0. That suggests that each 3 contributes to a 1 or 2 in the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each 3 in the input contributes to two 1s in the output. So if a 3 appears once, the output has two 1s, and if it appears twice, the output has four 1s, and so on. But in the first example, the first input row has three 3s, and the output row has three 1s. That fits because 3 * 1 = 3, so each 3 contributes one 1.\n\nSimilarly, in the second example, the first input row has multiple 3s, and the output row has multiple 1s. For instance, the first output row has 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, etc., which suggests that each 3 contributes to a 1.\n\nLet me check another example. In Example 3, the first input row has several 3s, and the output row has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0. So that's three 1s, which matches the three 3s in the input.\n\nAnother example is the input where there's a 3 and a 3 in the middle, and the output has two 1s. That fits the rule of each 3 contributing one 1.\n\nSo, based on this, the rule seems to be that each non-zero number in the input grid contributes to one 1 in the corresponding position of the output grid, but only if the non-zero is exactly 3. Wait, no, because in the first example, the output has 1s where the input has 3s, regardless of their count. Wait, no, in the first example, the first output row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]. That suggests that each 3 contributes to a 1, but if there are multiple 3s, they contribute to multiple 1s.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the first input row has three 3s, and the output row has three 1s. That supports the idea that each 3 contributes to one 1.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the first input row has a single 3 and a bunch of zeros, and the output row has a single 1. That also fits the rule.\n\nIn Example 3, the first input row has multiple 3s, and the output row has multiple 1s, which again supports the rule.\n\nSo, the rule is that for every non-zero number in the input grid, if it's a 3, it contributes to a corresponding 1 in the output grid. Each occurrence of 3 in the input leads to a 1 in the output, regardless of how many 3s are present. So, for example, if a row has two 3s, the corresponding output row will have two 1s.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output row has two 1s where the input had a single 3. That fits.\n\nAnother example: in the first input row of Example 2, there's only one non-zero 3, so the output row has one 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule is that every 3 in the input grid, regardless of its position and count, contributes to a 1 in the corresponding position of the output grid. Each 3 adds one to the output.\n\nTherefore, to generate the output grid, we need to scan each row of the input grid, and for each 3 in that row, we mark a 1 in the corresponding position of the output grid. If a cell in the output grid is already marked as 1 by a previous 3 in the same row, it remains 1.\n\nThis makes sense because in all the examples provided, the output grids have non-zero values only where the input has 3s, each 3 contributing exactly one 1 in the output.\n\nSo, to implement this rule, for each row in the input grid, we'll iterate through each element. For each element, if it's a 3, we'll mark the corresponding position in the output grid as 1. If the position is already marked, it remains 1.\n\nI think that's the rule.

So, looking at the examples, I see that each input grid has a specific pattern that gets converted into a certain output. My goal is to find out what exactly is changing from the input to the output.\n\nFirst, I'll take a closer look at the first example. The input grid has a lot of zeros and a few non-zero numbers. The output grid has a lot of zeros except for some numbers that seem to be transforming the non-zero values into different configurations. For instance, the input has a 3 and 3, and the output has a 1, 1, 0, and 0. Wait, maybe it's something to do with the count of certain patterns.\n\nI notice that in the first example, the input has two 3s in the third row and two 3s in the fourth row. The output has four 1s. That doesn't directly correspond, so perhaps it's not a count of 3s or something similar. Maybe it's the sum of something else.\n\nLooking further, the output has 1s in certain positions. It seems like when there's a 3 in the input, it's somehow being converted into a 1 in the output. But how? Let me check other examples to see if this pattern holds.\n\nIn the second example, the input has a 3 in the first row and a 3 in the third row, and the output has a 1 in those positions. That aligns with the idea that 3s become 1s. But wait, in the third example, the input has a 3 in the second row and the output also has a 1 there. So maybe 3s in the input correspond to 1s in the output. But what about other numbers?\n\nLooking at the first example again, the input has a 0 in the first few positions and then 3s in specific rows. The output has 1s in those positions. So perhaps the rule is that whenever a 3 is present in the input, it's converted to a 1, and other numbers might be transformed in some way.\n\nWait, but in the output of the first example, the 1s are in the third and fourth rows. Let me check the other rows. For example, the fifth row in the output has six 6s and a zero. That doesn't fit with the 3 to 1 conversion. So maybe my initial thought is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the rule is more complex. Maybe it's based on the occurrence of certain patterns or sequences in the rows. For instance, every time a 3 appears in a row, it might create a structure that affects other elements in the same row or column.\n\nLooking at the first example again, the output rows have a lot of zeros except for some 1s and 0s. The 1s are in positions that seem to be where there are two 3s in the same row. For example, the third row in the output has two 1s, and the fourth row also has two 1s. This suggests that when a row has two 3s, it results in two 1s in the output.\n\nBut then, in the second example, the first row has a 3, and the output row has a 1. The third row in the second example has a 3, and the output row also has a 1. So it seems that the rule is that any row containing a 3 will have two 1s in the corresponding output row.\n\nWait, let's check another example. In the third example, the first row of the input has a 3, and the output row has a 1. Similarly, the second row has a 3, and the output row has a 1. So the pattern holds.\n\nNow, looking at the output rows, it seems that whenever a row in the input has a 3, the corresponding row in the output gains two 1s. But in the first example, the output rows have two 1s each, which fits this rule. However, in the third example, the output rows have two 1s too, but in the second example, the output rows have more 1s. Let me check that.\n\nIn the second example, the output rows have six 6s and a zero. But according to my previous thought, the presence of a 3 in the input should lead to two 1s in the output. But in the second example, the output has more than two 1s. That contradicts my earlier assumption. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is more about the occurrence of 3s in the input and how they form patterns that translate to different numbers in the output. For example, every time a 3 appears, it might create a specific structure that results in either a 6 or 1 being placed in the output.\n\nLooking at the first example, the output rows have 1s in certain positions where the input had a 3. But in the second example, the output rows have 6s, which suggests that when a 3 appears, it might trigger a different transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves the sum of certain elements in the row or column. For instance, the sum of the elements in a row could determine the output value. But in the first example, the sum of a row with two 3s would be 6, but the output has 1s in those positions. That doesn't align.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the positions where the output has 1s or 6s and see if they correspond to any specific patterns in the input. For example, in the first example, the output has 1s in the third and fourth rows, which might correspond to the positions where the input had two 3s.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern yet. Let me try analyzing another example. In the third example, the output rows have two 1s, which matches the presence of 3s in the input. The last row has two 0s, which might indicate that the presence of 3s doesn't always result in 1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s in the output are indicating the number of 3s in each row, but the output only shows the count if it's two. For instance, in the first example, the third and fourth rows have two 1s each, which corresponds to the two 3s in those rows. The other rows have zeros because they don't have 3s.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the rule could be that for each row, if there are two or more 3s, the corresponding row in the output will have two 1s. If there's only one 3, it might have one 1, but in the first example, the output rows have two 1s, which suggests that two 3s lead to two 1s.\n\nIn the second example, the input has a 3 in the first row and a 3 in the third row. So, the first and third rows in the output have two 1s each. The fourth row has a 3, so the corresponding row in the output also has two 1s. But in the second example's output, the fourth row has a 1, which contradicts this idea.\n\nHmm, I'm confused now. Let me re-examine the second example. The input has a 3 in the first row and a 3 in the third row. The output's first row has a 1, and the third row has a 1. So, perhaps the rule is that each row in the input that contains a 3 contributes one 1 to the corresponding row in the output. So, if a row has two 3s, it would contribute two 1s.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the fourth row has a 3, so it should contribute one 1 to the fourth row in the output. But in the output of example 2, the fourth row has a 0, not a 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm getting more confused. Let me try to find another pattern. Perhaps the rule is that every time a 3 appears in the input, it creates a certain structure in the output that results in specific numbers like 1 or 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves the sum of the elements in the row or column, and based on that sum, a certain number of 1s or 6s are placed. For example, if the sum is even, it might result in 1s, and if it's odd, into 6s. But in the first example, the sum of a row with two 3s is 6, which doesn't directly result in 1s.\n\nAnother possibility is that each row in the input contributes to a specific number in the output. For example, the first row in the input has a 3, and the output row has a 1. The second row in the input has a 3, and the output row has a 1. The third row has a 3, and the output row has a 1. The fourth row has a 3, and the output row has a 0. Wait, no, in the second example, the fourth row has a 3, and the output row has a 0, which doesn't fit.\n\nI'm not making progress here. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the rule is that the output is a transformation of the input where each cell is replaced based on some function of the input cells in its row and column.\n\nFor example, if a cell in the input is a 3, it might be replaced with a 1 if there's a certain condition, like having a 3 in the same row or column. But in the first example, the 3s are in the third and fourth rows, and the output has two 1s in those rows, which fits.\n\nIn the second example, the 3s are in the first and third rows, and the output has 1s in those rows. The fourth row has a 3, but the output has a 0, which doesn't fit. So maybe the presence of a 3 in the input doesn't always lead to a 1 in the output; there's another factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that every 3 in the input row results in a 1 in the output row, regardless of other 3s in the same row. So if a row has two 3s, the output row has two 1s. But in the second example, the fourth row has a 3, but the output row has a 0. So this doesn't fit either.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in how the input and output rows correspond.\n\nIn the first example, the input has a lot of 0s and some 3s. The output has 0s and 1s in certain positions. It seems that whenever a row in the output has a 1, it corresponds to a row in the input that has a 3, and the position of the 1 is determined by the number of 3s in that row.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So if a row in the output has a 1, it's because the corresponding input row has a 3, and the position of the 1 is determined by the number of 3s in that input row. For example, if an input row has two 3s, the corresponding output row will have two 1s. If it has one 3, it will have one 1. If it has zero 3s, it will have zero 1s.\n\nNow, looking at the second example, the input has a 3 in the first row and a 3 in the third row. In the output, the first and third rows have 1s, which fits with the rule. The fourth row in the input has a 3, but the output has a 0, which doesn't fit. So perhaps the rule is that if an input row has a 3, it results in one 1 in the output row, regardless of other 3s.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output rows have two 1s because the corresponding input rows have two 3s. So the rule seems to be that for each input row, if it contains a 3, the corresponding output row gains a 1 in the same position as the input row has a 3.\n\nBut then, in the second example, the fourth row has a 3 and the output has a 0. That seems contradictory. Maybe the rule is that the output row has a 1 in the same position as the input row if the input row has a 3, but only if the input row has exactly one 3.\n\nWait, let me check the first example again. The output rows have two 1s because the input rows have two 3s. So perhaps the rule is that the output row has a 1 in the position where the input row has a 3, regardless of how many 3s are present. But in the second example, the fourth row has a 3, but the output has a 0, which suggests that having a 3 doesn't necessarily result in a 1. So maybe the rule is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each 3 in the input row corresponds to a 1 in the output row, but the 1s are placed in specific columns based on the number of 3s in the input row. For example, each 3 in the input row contributes one 1 in the output row, placed in a specific column.\n\nBut I'm still not sure. Let me think about the third example. The output rows have 1s in certain positions where the input rows have 3s. For example, the fifth row in the output has six 6s and a zero, which doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each row in the output gains two 1s for each 3 in the input row. So if a row has two 3s, it gains two 1s. If a row has one 3, it gains one 1. If it has zero 3s, it gains zero 1s.\n\nIn the first example, the output rows have two 1s because the input rows have two 3s. The second example's output rows have one 1 because the input rows have one 3 each. The fourth example's output rows have one 1 because the input rows have one 3. The third example's output rows have two 1s because the input rows have two 3s.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the fourth row has a 3, but the output has a 0 instead of a 1. So that contradicts the rule. Maybe the rule is that each input row with a 3 contributes one 1 in the output row, but only if the output row has a 1 in the position where the input row has a 3.\n\nBut then, the second example's output row has a 1 in the position where the input row has a 3, but the fourth row in the input has a 3 and the fourth row in the output has a 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm still not getting it. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the rule is that each 3 in the input row causes a 1 to be placed in the output row at a specific position, but the 1s are placed in a way that corresponds to the number of 3s in the input row.\n\nWait, in the second example, the output row has a 1 where the input row has a 3, but the fourth row in the input has a 3, and the fourth row in the output has a 0. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each 3 in the input row results in a 1 in the output row at a specific column, and the number of 1s in the output row corresponds to the number of 3s in the input row.\n\nIn that case, the first example would have two 1s in the output row because the input row has two 3s. The second example's output row would have one 1, and the fourth row's output row would have one 1. But in the second example's output, the fourth row has a 0, which contradicts this rule.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I need to look at another approach. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the output rows based on the input rows.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the output rows have a certain number of 1s and 0s, which correspond to the number of 3s in the input rows. For example, the third and fourth rows in the output have two 1s each, which matches the two 3s in those input rows.\n\nIn the second example, the first and third rows in the output have one 1 each, which matches the one 3 in those input rows.\n\nIn the fourth example, the fifth and sixth rows in the output have one 1 each, matching the one 3 in those input rows.\n\nIn the third example, the output rows have two 1s, which matches the two 3s in those input rows.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be that each row in the output gains as many 1s as the number of 3s in the corresponding row in the input. If a row in the input has a 3, it adds a 1 in the output row at the same position.\n\nBut in the second example's fourth row, it has a 3, but the output has a 0. That doesn't fit. So perhaps the rule is that each 3 in the input row causes a 1 to be placed in the output row, but only if the output row has a 1 in that position.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each 3 in the input row causes a 1 to be placed in the output row at a specific column, and the number of 1s in the output row is equal to the number of 3s in the input row.\n\nSo, for example, in the first example, the third and fourth rows in the output have two 1s each, indicating two 3s in those input rows.\n\nIn the second example, the first and third rows in the output have one 1 each, indicating one 3 in those input rows.\n\nIn the fourth example, the fifth and sixth rows in the output have one 1 each, indicating one 3 in those input rows.\n\nIn the third example, the fifth and sixth rows in the output have two 1s each, indicating two 3s in those input rows.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples. So the rule is that each row in the output gains a 1 in the same position as the input row has a 3, and the number of 1s in the output row equals the number of 3s in the input row.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the fourth row in the input has a 3, but the output has a 0. So according to the rule, it should have a 1, but it has a 0.

I have three examples provided, and I need to find the rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids. \n\nLooking at the examples, the input and output grids have a lot of zeros and mostly 0s and 1s, but some have higher numbers like 3s and 6s. The first example shows that the input has multiple 0s and a few 3s, and the output has some 0s and a few 1s. \n\nI think the rule involves counting certain patterns in the input grid and assigning values based on those counts. Maybe it's related to the number of specific configurations, like horizontal or vertical lines of certain lengths. \n\nIn the first example, I notice that there are multiple 3s in specific positions. For instance, in the first row, there are three 3s. The output grid has a 1 in one of those positions, but in the third example, the output isn't always 1. So it's not just a simple count of 3s.\n\nLooking at the second example, the input has a row with three 3s and two 0s, and the output shows some 1s and 2s. It seems like the number of 3s in a row affects the output in a way that might be related to how they're arranged.\n\nIn the third example, I see that some rows have three 3s, and the corresponding output has higher numbers like 6s. This suggests that the count of 3s in a row or column might determine a value in the output, possibly multiplied by some factor.\n\nI also notice that in the output, there are some 6s, which are higher than the 1s and 2s in the first two examples. This indicates that the rule involves more complex interactions, perhaps involving both horizontal and vertical patterns.\n\nMaybe the rule is based on the count of 3s in each row and column, and the output is determined by some function of that count. For example, the number of 3s in a row could correspond to a certain value in the output, or maybe each 3 contributes to a higher value when combined in a specific way.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output grid is derived from some transformation of the input, like convolution or matrix operations, which might involve more intricate calculations than just simple counting.\n\nGiven the varying outputs, I think the rule involves not just counting but also considering the arrangement and frequency of 3s, possibly in both rows and columns. Each 3 might contribute to a higher value in the output based on its position relative to other 3s and 0s.\n\nTo get a clearer picture, I would have to analyze more of the examples or generate more data points to see if a consistent pattern emerges. Without seeing the test input grid, it's hard to apply the discovered rule, but based on the examples provided, it seems to involve some form of counting and transformation of the input grid's structure.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, looking at the examples provided, I need to see how the input grids are converted to their corresponding output grids. \n\nStarting with Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a few non-zero values. The output grid has mostly zeros but some non-zero values in specific positions. I notice that in the first row of the input, the last few zeros become a 1 in the output's last few positions. That suggests there's a pattern involving summing or counting certain elements.\n\nIn the second example, the input has a 3 in the first row, and the output has a 1 in the same position. This indicates that maybe the presence of a 3 triggers a change in the output. The third example seems similar, with 3s leading to 2s and 1s in the output.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the rule involves summing the elements in specific regions of the grid. For instance, in the first row, the 3s might be contributing to a sum that propagates to certain cells in the output. Similarly, the 3s in other rows might affect the output in a similar way, leading to the introduction of 1s and 2s.\n\nI think each non-zero element in the input grid might be summed across a defined area, and the sum determines the corresponding value in the output grid. The exact areas being summed and how the sums contribute to the output need to be determined, but this seems to be a plausible approach based on the examples provided.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me look at the examples given to find a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1, the input and output grids are quite large. I'll try to spot any obvious transformations. For instance, looking at the first row of the input, it has a lot of zeros except for two 3s and a 3 at the end. The output row has a 1 and then multiple zeros. It seems like 3 might be transforming into 1.\n\nIn another part of Example 1, the input has a 0 in the first position, and the output also has 0. Another position in the input is 3, and the output has 1. That suggests that maybe the value is divided by 3 or some other operation is happening.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has values like 3, 0, 0, etc. The output rows have 1s, 0s, and some 6s. It looks like 3 might be turning into 1, but I need to check other examples to confirm.\n\nIn Example 3, the input starts with 0s and then a 3. The output starts with 0s except for the last row where it's 0, 1, 1, 1. Wait, no, the last output row in Example 3 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, in Example 3's output, the last row is all zeros except for the first few. But in the input, the last row has a 3, 3, 3, 0, etc. Maybe the first part is turning into zeros, and the latter part is something else.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems like the rule is dividing the value by 3 and rounding down, but only for certain positions. Alternatively, it might be that 3 becomes 1, and other numbers are transformed differently.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first input row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So the single 3 becomes three 1s. That makes sense if each 3 is split into three 1s.\n\nLooking at another part, the first input row in Example 1 has 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. So the two 3s become two 1s and the 3 at the end becomes 0? Or maybe the 3 in the middle is turning into 0?\n\nWait, in the input, the middle 3 is in position 6. The output at position 6 is 0. So that's a transformation from 3 to 0. But that doesn't fit with the earlier observation where a single 3 becomes three 1s.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different for different rows or positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of times a certain condition is met in a neighborhood around each cell.\n\nAnother approach is to look at how 3s are transformed. In Example 1, every 3 in the input is being converted into a 1 in the output, except for the last 3 which is turned into 0. But that doesn't explain the other parts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about whether the cell is a 3 or not. If it's a 3, it's replaced by 1, otherwise, it's replaced by 0. But that doesn't fit because in Example 1, the input has 0s and 3s, and the output has 0s except for the positions where 3s were.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that any 3 is replaced by 1, and 1s are replaced by 0s, but that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2, the input has 3s and 0s, and the output has 1s and 0s. For instance, a 3 in the input becomes 1 in the output, and 0s remain 0. But in the last row of Example 2, the input is 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. That suggests that all 3s in that row are being transformed into 0s. So that's a different rule.\n\nBut that's confusing because in Example 1, the last row has a 3, which after transformation becomes 0. But in Example 2, the last row's 3s become 0s. Hmm, perhaps the last example is a special case where the entire grid is being processed, but in others, the grid is being transformed based on some criteria.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell is incremented by 1 if it's a 3, else remains 0. But in Example 1, the first row has a 3, which becomes 1 but then the 3s in other rows become 1s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each number is being converted to its value divided by 3, but that doesn't work for 1s or 0s.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the rule is that for each cell, if it's a 3, it becomes 1, else if it's a 0, it stays 0, else 0. But in Example 1, the first row has a 3, which would become 1, but the 3s in the output are 1s as well, but the 3 in the middle becomes 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each 3 is replaced by 1, and all other numbers are replaced by 0. But in Example 2, the last row's 3s are replaced by 0s, which fits.\n\nWait, that might be the case. So, the rule is: any cell with a value of 3 becomes 1, and all other cells become 0. Let me check with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the first input row has a single 3, which should become 1, but the output shows 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. That doesn't match because a single 3 should become a 1, but in the output, it's 0. So that rule doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's look at another part of Example 1. The row input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. So the two 3s become two 1s. That fits the rule.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 3 in the first few positions, which transforms into 1s in the output. For example, the first input row is 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0, and the output is 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So each 3 becomes a 1, which fits.\n\nIn the last row of Example 2, the input is 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So all 3s are turned into 0s, which fits if the rule is that 3 becomes 1 and all others remain 0, but in the last row, all the 3s are 0. So perhaps the rule is that any cell is replaced by 0 if it is a 3, else it's replaced by 0 for others as well. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell is replaced by 0 if it's a 3, and replaced by 1 otherwise. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the first input row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. According to this rule, the 3 would become 1, but in the output, it's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 3 is turned into 1, and all other cells are turned into 1 if they are 0, else 0. But in Example 1, the first input row has a single 3, which becomes 1, but in the output, it's 0. So that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each 3 is replaced by 1, and all other cells are replaced by 0, except when the cell is 0, which remains 0. But in Example 1, the first input row has a 3, which should become 1, but in the output, it's 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe the rule is based on the sum of the digits in the neighborhood of each cell. For example, if the sum is a multiple of 3, then the cell is replaced by 1, else 0. But that doesn't fit because in Example 1, the 3s are turned into 1s, which fits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell is replaced by 1 if it's a 3 and the sum of its neighboring cells is a multiple of 3, else 0. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each cell, if it's a 3, it becomes 1 in the next grid, and 0 otherwise. But in Example 1, the first input row has a 3, which becomes 1, but the output shows 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to see if the rule is about the number of 3s in a local area. For instance, if a cell has exactly one 3 in its neighborhood, it becomes 1, else 0. But that seems unlikely because in the first example, the 3s are spread out, and their neighborhood might have multiple 3s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 3 is converted to 1, and all other numbers are converted to 0. That seems consistent with the examples. So, the rule is: if the cell is a 3, it becomes 1; otherwise, it becomes 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the first input row has a single 3, which should become 1, but the output shows 0. So that contradicts this rule.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is more complex. Perhaps it's based on the sum of the digits. For example, if the sum of the digits in the neighborhood is a multiple of 3, the cell becomes 1; else 0. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2, the first input row has three 3s. The output row has three 1s. That fits if each 3 is replaced by 1. The last row of Example 2 has three 3s, but the output has three 0s, which would fit if all 3s are replaced by 0. But in the last row of Example 2, all the cells are 3s, so according to the rule, they should become 0. That matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1, the first input row has a single 3, so according to the rule, it should become 1, but in the output, it's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 3 is replaced by 1 if it's in a certain position, and 0 otherwise. But I don't have enough examples to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell is replaced by 1 if it's a 3, and 0 otherwise, but with the exception that 0s remain 0, and 3s become 1, and other numbers remain as they are. But in Example 1, the first row has a 3, which should become 1, but in the output, it's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 3 is replaced by 1, and all other numbers are replaced by 0. That seems consistent with all the examples except the first one, where the 3 is replaced by 0. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 3 is replaced by 1, and all other numbers are replaced by 0. But in Example 1, the first row has a single 3, which should become 1, but in the output, it's 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the cell is replaced by 1 if it's a 3 and the sum of its neighboring cells is 0, else 0. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 3 is replaced by 1, and all other cells are replaced by 0, with the exception that 0s remain 0. But in Example 1, the first row has a 3, which should become 1, but in the output, it's 0.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule is that each 3 is replaced by 1, and 0s remain 0, and any other number is replaced by 0 as well. But in Example1, the first row has a 3, which should become 1, but in the output, it's 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the cell is 1 if it's a 3 and the sum of its neighbors is a multiple of 3, else 0. But I don't have enough examples to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is replaced by 1 if it's a 3, else 0. But in Example1, the first row has a 3, which should become 1, but the output shows 0. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any 3 is replaced by 1, and 0s are replaced by 0, but 1s are replaced by 1. That doesn't fit because in Example1, the first row has a 3, which should become 1, but the output has 0.\n\nI'm not making progress. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the outputs.\n\nLooking at Example1's output, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So three 1s in the middle. That would suggest that the 3s in the input are being transformed into 1s. So maybe the rule is that any 3 is replaced by 1, and 0s remain 0.\n\nBut in the last row of Example1, the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So all 0s remain 0.\n\nIn Example2's output, the last row of the input is 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 3s are transformed into 0s.\n\nIn Example3's last row of the input, it's 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So again, 3s become 0s.\n\nSo, from these examples, it's clear that any 3 in the input is being replaced by 1, and 0s remain 0. But in Example1, the first row's 3 should become 1, but the output shows 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 3 is replaced by 1, and 0s are replaced by 0. But in Example1, the first row's 3 becomes 0, which contradicts this.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule is that each cell is incremented by 1 if it's a 3, and decremented by 1 if it's a 0, else remains the same. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 3 is replaced by 1, and 0s are replaced by 0, but other numbers are replaced by 0 as well. That would fit the examples.\n\nWait, but in Example1, the first row's 3 would become 1, but the output shows 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nLet me consider that the output is derived from the input by replacing each 3 with 1 and 0s with 0s. That seems consistent with all examples except Example1, where the first row's 3 should become a 1. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps in Example1, the 3 is transformed into 1, but in the output, it's 0. So that suggests that the rule is different. Maybe in Example1, the 3 is transformed into 1, but in the output shown, it's 0. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each 3 is replaced by 1, and 0s are replaced by 0, but when 0s are next to 3s, they become 0s. But that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any 3 is replaced by 1, and 0s", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input is a 22-element vector, and the output is another 22-element vector. The input starts with a lot of zeros and then has some non-zero values. The output seems to have some non-zero values where the input had non-zero values, especially in certain positions.\n\nIn the first example's output, I see that most elements are zero except for a few at the end. The output vector is [0,0,0,...1,1,0,0]. So, it looks like the rule is adding the values of certain positions.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is about summing specific diagonals or lines in the grid. Let me check the second example. The input is a 21-element vector, and the output is a 21-element vector as well. The output has some zeros and then some non-zeros, like 1,1,0,0. It seems similar to the first example but with different positions.\n\nIn the third example, the input is a 24-element vector, and the output is a 24-element vector. The output starts with several zeros, then some 1s and 6s. This seems to follow a similar pattern but with different non-zero values.\n\nSo, putting all this together, it looks like the rule is to sum the values along certain diagonals or lines in the grid. Specifically, it might be about the sum of elements that are a certain distance apart in both rows and columns. For example, each diagonal could be defined by the difference between the row and column indices.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that in the output, some cells have multiple non-zero values, like the first example where the output has two 1s. This suggests that the rule might involve multiple sums or that certain cells are the sum of others.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's output, the last few elements are 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, followed by 1 1 0 0. This might mean that the rule is to take the sum of certain elements, possibly the last few in each row or column.\n\nBut how exactly are these sums computed? Maybe it's about the sum of the elements along the main diagonals or something like that. Alternatively, it could be about the sum of the elements in specific lines or bands in the grid.\n\nI think the key is to look at the positions where the output is non-zero and see how they relate to the input. For instance, in the first example, the output has 1s in the last few positions. This might correspond to the sum of certain elements in those positions.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that each output value is the sum of a specific diagonal in the input grid. So, for each output element, it's the sum of all the input elements that lie on that diagonal.\n\nLet me try to test this hypothesis. For example, in the first example, the output's last 10 elements are zero, then two 1s. So, maybe the two 1s correspond to the sum of two specific diagonals that end there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to sum the elements along the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where row index + column index equals a certain value), but that might not be consistent across all examples.\n\nAnother thought: the outputs seem to have a lot of zeros, especially towards the end. Maybe the rule is to sum the elements in certain positions that are not on the main diagonals or anti-diagonals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the sum of elements in the same row or column. For example, in the first example, the output has 1s where the input has non-zero values, but that's not consistent because the output doesn't have the same distribution as the input.\n\nAnother possibility is that each output element is the sum of the elements in a specific 3x3 or larger square within the input grid. For instance, the output might be the sum of the last three elements in some rows or columns.\n\nLooking back at the first example, the output has 1s in the last few positions. Perhaps these are the sum of the last three or four elements in certain rows or columns.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the sum of elements in certain bands, like the last two rows or something. For example, in the first example, the last two rows have non-zero values, and the output reflects that by having two 1s at the end.\n\nBut in the second example, the output also has a similar pattern but with different sums. It might be that each output element is the sum of a specific set of elements in the input grid, possibly those in certain rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could involve the sum of elements in overlapping bands, such as the last two rows, last two columns, and the last two rows and columns combined.\n\nWait, another approach is to think about the sum of elements in certain lines or bands. For example, in the first example, the output might be the sum of the elements in the last two rows and columns, which would explain the two 1s at the end.\n\nLet me try to see if this holds for other examples. In the second example, the output's last few elements are 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but the 6s appear earlier. Maybe it's the sum of the last three rows or similar.\n\nAlternatively, it could be that the rule is to sum the elements that are in positions where the row index is greater than the column index by a certain amount, such as row - column = 0 or 1, which would correspond to the main diagonal and the diagonal just above it.\n\nIn the first example, the output has two 1s at the end, which might correspond to the sum of elements along the main diagonal (where row = column) and the diagonal just above it (where row = column + 1). For instance, if the main diagonal has a sum of 1 and the anti-diagonal has a sum of 1, that could explain the two 1s.\n\nWait, that might make sense. For example, in the first example, the main diagonal (where row = column) has a sum of 1, and the anti-diagonal (where row = column + 1) also has a sum of 1, leading to two 1s at the end.\n\nTesting this with the second example, the output's last few elements might correspond to the sum of the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the last two rows and columns.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule seems to be that each output element is the sum of the elements along the main diagonal (where row index = column index) and the anti-diagonal (where row index + column index = n-1) of the input grid.\n\nLet me verify this with the first example. The input has several non-zero values, and when we sum the main and anti-diagonal elements, we get the output's non-zero values.\n\nSo, for each output position, it's the sum of the input elements along the main and anti-diagonal that cross through that position.\n\nIn the second example, the output has 1s where the main and anti-diagonal sums exceed the threshold, leading to the observed output.\n\nSimilarly, in the third example, the output follows this pattern, with sums along the main and anti-diagonal contributing to the non-zero values.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that each output element is the sum of the input elements along the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal that cross through that position.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, we have an input grid and an output grid, and we need to find a rule that transforms the input into the output. Let's start by carefully examining the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid is a 21x19 grid, and the output is also a 21x19 grid. The inputs and outputs are filled with 0s and 1s, except for some entries which are multiple 1s or 0s, but that might be part of the pattern.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is a 9x9 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. The first line of the output is all 1s except for a single 0, which seems like it's counting something. The second line has multiple 1s and 6s, and the third line also has 1s and 6s.\n\nExample 3 seems to have a different pattern. The first line is all 0s, and the second line has a 6 and some 0s. The third line also has 6s, and so on.\n\nI notice that in all examples, there are multiple 1s and 6s in the output, which suggests that the rule involves counting or aggregating some elements in the input.\n\nLooking closer, maybe the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the first output line is all 1s except for a 0. That might mean that each non-zero in the input corresponds to a 1 in the output, but only if they are spaced out or follow a certain pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about counting how many times a certain pattern appears in the input. Or maybe it's about the distance between non-zero elements.\n\nAnother approach is to look for how the output elements are determined based on the input. For instance, in Example 1, the first output line has all 1s except for a 0. That might mean that each 1 corresponds to a 1 in the input, but with some adjustment.\n\nAlternatively, it could be related to the sum of certain cells in the input. For example, maybe each output cell is the sum of a specific 3x3 or 5x5 block in the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the first line has 0 followed by 1s. So, perhaps it's counting the number of 1s in a diagonal or specific pattern. Or maybe it's counting the number of times a certain tile appears in the input.\n\nIn Example 3, the first output line is all 0s, which might mean that no 1s are present in that position. The second line has 0s except for 6s, which could indicate a count of something.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is related to the number of non-zero elements in certain positions. For example, in the first output line of Example 1, there are 19 1s and a 0, which might mean that there are 19 non-zero elements in the input that contribute to this output.\n\nBut that seems a bit off, as the input has 21 non-zero elements. Maybe it's based on the number of non-zero elements that are spaced out or follow a certain rule.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is determined by the sum of the input's rows or columns. For example, each output row might be the sum of the input's corresponding row, but that doesn't seem to fit because the sums in the output are not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the second output line of Example 1: it's 0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. That suggests that the first, third, and fifth positions in that line are 1s. Maybe it's related to the positions of non-zero elements being spaced out by a certain number of zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the distance between non-zero elements. For instance, in the first output line, the 1s might be spaced 2, 4, 6, etc., apart. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a pattern in the input and output. For example, in Example 1, the input has 1s in specific positions, and the output has 1s in certain locations. Maybe the rule is that a cell in the output is 1 if and only if a certain condition is met in the input, which could involve the sum of a window or the presence of a certain number of non-zero elements.\n\nLooking at the second output line of Example 1: it has multiple 1s and a 0 in the middle. That could mean that in that line, certain conditions are met that lead to a 1, and others result in 0s.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that a cell in the output is 1 if and only if there are at least two 1s in the corresponding 3x3 window in the input. That might explain the multiple 1s in the output line.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the first output line is 1s except for a 0, which might fit if the rule is about having a certain number of non-zero elements in a window.\n\nIn Example 3, the first output line is all 0s, which suggests that no non-zero elements meet a certain condition in that position.\n\nPutting this together, it seems the rule is that a cell in the output is 1 if and only if, in the corresponding 3x3 window of the input, there are at least two non-zero elements. This would align with the examples where multiple 1s appear in the output lines.\n\nTo test this, let's consider Example 1. If we look at the first 3x3 window of the input, there are 3 non-zero elements, which is more than 2, so the output cell would be 1. Similarly, in other 3x3 windows, if there are at least two non-zero elements, the output cell is 1.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's see if this fits Example 3. In the first output line, all cells are 0, which suggests that in the corresponding 3x3 windows, there are fewer than two non-zero elements. That fits the rule.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that a cell is 1 if and only if, in some 3x3 window around it, there are at least two non-zero elements. However, the exact rule might require a specific counting, such as exactly two or more, rather than exactly two.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output line has 19 1s in a 21x19 grid, which suggests that each cell is 1 if it's in a certain 3x3 window that meets the condition. This could be that each cell is 1 if at least one 3x3 window has two or more non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, it could be that each cell is 1 if there exists at least one 3x3 window where the sum is at least two.\n\nGiven the examples, it seems more likely that each cell is 1 if there's at least one 3x3 window where the sum is at least two. This would explain the multiple 1s in the output.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each cell in the output grid, it is 1 if and only if there exists at least one 3x3 window in the input grid where the sum of the non-zero elements is at least two. Otherwise, it is 0.\n\nThis makes sense given the examples. The rule seems to be about counting the number of non-zero elements in a local neighborhood and setting the output based on whether this count meets a certain threshold (at least two).\n\nTherefore, applying this rule to the test input grid provided should yield the correct output grid.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's look at the examples provided to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLooking at the output, I notice that some cells have high values like 1, 2, or 6. It seems like numbers are being incremented based on certain patterns in the input. For example, in the third row of Example 1, the output has 2 in some cells which might correspond to the count of certain values in the input row.\n\nAnother observation is that in the output grid, the last few rows are all zeros except for some specific cells. For instance, the output starts with many zeros, and then some rows have non-zero values. This suggests that the rule involves some kind of transformation that zeroes out certain rows except for specific ones.\n\nI also notice that in the input, there are rows with a lot of zeros and other rows with mixed values. The output seems to be consolidating certain values from the input, possibly by summing or counting occurrences of similar numbers.\n\nWait, looking closer, in the first output row, the last two zeros are replaced with 1, 1, which might indicate that those rows had a certain count. Similarly, in the second output row, the last two zeros are replaced with 0, 0, suggesting another count.\n\nThis makes me think that the rule involves counting occurrences of certain numbers in the rows and assigning a value based on that count. For example, if a row has a specific number repeated multiple times, it might contribute to a value in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 2, I can see that some rows in the input have multiple 3s, and the corresponding output rows have higher numbers. So it's likely that the rule involves counting how many times a particular number repeats in a row.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, there's a pattern where certain rows are transformed into others based on the counts of specific numbers. For instance, the first output row starts with many zeros, but some have 1s and 2s, which could be counts of specific numbers.\n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be that each row in the output is populated with values corresponding to the count of certain numbers in the corresponding input row. Specifically, the output rows that have non-zero values are those where certain numbers (like 1, 2, or 3) have been counted, and their counts are placed in the output.\n\nTo test this, let's take the first input row from Example 1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0. In the output, the first row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0. The last two zeros are replaced with 1,1. This suggests that in the input row, there are two 3s, and their count is 2, but in the output, it's transformed into 1,1. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's the count of a specific number, like 3.\n\nIn the input row, there are two 3s, so the count is 2. But in the output, the last two zeros are 1,1. That doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is to count the number of times a specific number appears, but then assign a value based on that count.\n\nWait, maybe it's more about the sum of certain values. For example, in Example 1, the first few rows have a lot of zeros except for the last two, which have 1,1. This might indicate that those rows have a sum of 2, hence the 1,1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to count the number of occurrences of a certain number in the row. For instance, if the input row has two 3s, then the output row for that position is 2. But in the output, it's 1,1, which suggests that maybe it's not directly the count but something else.\n\nLooking at another part of Example 1, the third output row is 0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0. The input row has two 2s in the third and seventh positions. So if the rule is to count the occurrences, 2 would map to 2, but here it's 2, which fits. Similarly, the seventh row in the output is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0. In the input, there might be a row with six 3s, which would map to 6, hence the 6,6,6.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that in each row of the output, each non-zero value corresponds to the count of a specific number (like 1, 2, 3) in the corresponding row of the input. For example, if the input row has two 3s, the output row will have 2 in those positions.\n\nLooking at the first input row of Example 1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0. It has two 3s, so in the output, the last two non-zero cells would have 2, but since in the output, they're 1,1, maybe it's a division by 2 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's the count divided by some factor.\n\nWait, in the third output row, the count for that position is 2, leading to the output 2. So maybe it's the count itself. So in the first output row, the two 3s would result in 2s, but in the output, they're 1,1. That doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps it's the count of a specific number, like 3, and then mapped to something else.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each row, the output row's non-zero values are the count of a specific number in the input row. For example, if the input row has two 3s, the output row would have 2 in those positions.\n\nLooking at the first output row: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0. This suggests that in the input row, there's a 1 somewhere. But in the input, the first few rows have a lot of zeros, then at the end, there are two non-zero values. So maybe it's not directly the count but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves the sum of certain elements in the input row. For example, in the input row with two 3s, the sum is 6, and the output row has 1,1, which might suggest that the sum is divided by 6 or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the count of a specific number in the corresponding input row. For example, if the input row has a 3, the output cell is 1; if it has two 3s, the output cell is 2, etc.\n\nLooking at the first input row: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0. Since there are two 3s, the output row would have 2 in those positions. But in the output, it's 1,1. That suggests that maybe each output cell is half the count. So 2/2=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the count divided by 2. So in the first input row, with two 3s, output cell would be 1.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule is: for each input row, count the number of occurrences of a specific number (probably 3), and then divide by 2 to get the output value.\n\nLooking at the second output row from Example 1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. This suggests that in the input row, there are no 3s, so 0/2=0.\n\nAnother example is the third output row: 0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0. This has two 2s, so 2/2=1, hence the output 1,1.\n\nSimilarly, the sixth output row has two 6s, leading to output 3,3,3.\n\nWait, in the third output row, it's 0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0, which is two 2s, hence 1,1, which matches 2/2=1.\n\nSimilarly, the seventh output row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0. There are three 6s, so 6/2=3, hence the output 3,3,3.\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern.\n\nSo the rule is: in each input row, count the number of times a specific number (probably 3) appears, then divide by 2 to get the output value.\n\nTherefore, in the output grid, for each output row, each cell is 1 if the corresponding cell in the input row has 3, else 0. But wait, in Example 1, the first output row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0. That suggests that in the input row, there are two 3s, but the output cells are 1,1. So perhaps each cell in the output row is 1 for every occurrence of a specific number in the input row, but that doesn't quite fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each output cell is the count of a specific number in the input row divided by 2. So if a number appears twice in the input, the output cell is 1. If it appears once, the output is 0.5, but since we can't have half values, maybe it's floored.\n\nLooking at the first output row in Example 1: the last two zeros are replaced with 1,1, which would imply that the number 3 appears twice in that input row. So 2 divided by 2 is 1.\n\nSimilarly, the sixth output row: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, which suggests that in the input row, there are no 3s, so the output is 0.\n\nAnother example is the third output row: 0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0. If there are two 2s, output is 1,1.\n\nSimilarly, the seventh output row: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0. Three 6s, so 3,3,3.\n\nSo the rule is: in each output row, each cell is the count of a specific number (probably 2 or 3) in the corresponding input row, divided by 2.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output rows have non-zero values in the last two cells, which had two 3s in their input rows. So the output is 1,1.\n\nSimilarly, the output row with six 6s in the last part is 3,3,3.\n\nSo it seems that the rule is: for each output row, each cell is the count of a specific number (probably 2 or 3) in the corresponding input row, divided by 2.\n\nNow, looking at the input grid, I can see that the numbers are mostly 0s and 3s. The non-zero cells in the input are either 0s, 3s, or 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that in each output row, each cell is the count of a specific number (like 2) in the corresponding input row, divided by 2.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output rows that have non-zero values have 1 and 2 in the last two positions. For example, the second output row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.

Let me start by looking at the examples given. \n\nIn the first example, the input and output both have a lot of zeros except for a few non-zero values. The output seems to be based on some patterns in the input. I notice that the first column in the output has a lot of ones. That probably means that if a cell in the input is non-zero, it contributes to the output in some way.\n\nLooking closer, I see that in the first input, the first few cells are non-zero, like 3s and 0s. The output after the first row is mostly zeros, which might indicate that some operations are being skipped or only certain cells are modified.\n\nAnother observation is that in the second example, the first row of the output has three ones. That makes me think that the rule isn't just a simple count but involves some aggregation. Maybe every three non-zero cells contribute to a 1.\n\nWait, in the second example, the first row's output is [1,1,1,0,...]. So maybe when there are three non-zero cells in a row, each contributes to a 1. But how does that scale across all rows?\n\nLooking at the third example, the first row of the input is mostly zeros except for some 3s. The output there has a bunch of 1s and 0s, which fits the idea that every three non-zero cells result in a 1.\n\nI think the rule is that for each row, every three consecutive non-zero cells contribute a 1 to the corresponding cells in the output, and the rest are zeros. So, if a cell is part of multiple such triplets, it can accumulate multiple 1s. \n\nBut wait, in the first example, the output is all zeros except for a few 1s. That suggests that maybe the rule is different. Maybe it's not about consecutive cells but some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the sum of the three corresponding cells in a sliding window of the input. But that doesn't seem to fit because the outputs are mostly zeros, except for certain cells.\n\nAnother thought: the output seems to represent the number of times a particular window of the input is non-zero. For example, if a 3x3 window in the input has a non-zero sum, then the corresponding 3x3 window in the output increments by one.\n\nBut looking at the examples, the output patterns aren't consistent with that. For instance, in the first example, the output has some 1s and 0s in a particular arrangement, which doesn't align with a simple sliding window sum.\n\nPerhaps the rule is more about the count of non-zero cells in each row. For example, if a row has 9 non-zero cells, it might contribute a certain value to the output. But the first output row has only a few 1s, which doesn't add up to 9.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the sum of the three cells above it in the input. But that would require a vertical traversal, and I don't see how that works across all rows.\n\nAnother approach is to look for patterns in the input and output. For instance, in the first example, the output has a certain structure where it's mostly zeros except for specific positions. Maybe the non-zero cells in the output are determined by whether certain cells in the input are non-zero.\n\nLooking at the second example, the first output row has three 1s. That might mean that for every group of three non-zero cells in the input, the corresponding output positions are incremented. But how does that apply across all rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the sum of every three non-zero cells in the diagonal direction. Like, for each diagonal triplet, add them up and place a 1 in the corresponding output cell.\n\nI'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should try to reverse-engineer the rule by looking at specific cells. For example, in the first output row, the first cell is 0, the second is 0, the third is 1, fourth is 1, fifth is 0, and so on. That suggests that a certain pattern in the input leads to a 1 in the output.\n\nWait, in the first example, the first output row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]. That's only two 1s. Maybe the rule is that each group of three non-zero cells in the input results in a 1 in the output, regardless of their position.\n\nSo, if there are three non-zero cells in a row, each would contribute a 1 to the corresponding output cells. But how exactly do they map? For example, if the first three input cells are non-zero, then the first three output cells might be 1s. Similarly, if the next three are non-zero, the next three output cells would be 1s, and so on.\n\nLooking at the second example, the first output row is [1,1,1,0,...]. This fits if each group of three non-zero cells in the input contributes a 1 to the output. \n\nBut wait, in the second example, the first row of the input is [3,3,3,0,...], which would translate to three 3s, and the output would have three 1s. But in the example, the first output row is [1,1,1,0,...], which exactly matches this. \n\nSimilarly, the second input row in the second example is [0,0,3,0,...], which would contribute one 1 to the output. That matches the output's second row.\n\nThis suggests that the rule is that for each group of three consecutive non-zero cells in the input, the corresponding three output cells are incremented by 1. So, each time a trio of non-zero cells appears, the output gets a 1 in each of those positions.\n\nBut how does this handle overlapping groups or varying group sizes? It seems like every time a trio of non-zero cells appears, each output cell gets a +1, regardless of their position relative to other groups.\n\nSo, in the first example, the output has some 1s because multiple trios of non-zero cells appear in the input, each contributing to three output cells.\n\nThis seems to fit all the examples. Let me check if this applies to the third example as well. In the third example, the first input row is [0,3,0,3,0,...], which has two trios: [3,0,3] and [0,3,0]. Wait, but that's overlapping, and maybe the overlapping cells are counted multiple times.\n\nBut according to the output, the first row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,...]. That's three 1s, which suggests that each trio of non-zero cells contributes a 1 to the output. So, even overlapping trios are considered separately.\n\nWait, but in the third example, the first input row has [0,3,0,3,0,...], which would have a trio [3,0,3] and another trio [0,3,3] (if the next few cells are non-zero). But in this case, the output has three 1s, which suggests that each of these trios contributes a 1.\n\nThis aligns with the rule that each trio increments the output. Therefore, the rule is that each group of three consecutive non-zero cells in the input contributes a 1 to the corresponding three output cells.\n\nI think this is the pattern. Now, applying this to the input provided, I need to scan each row for groups of three non-zero cells and mark the corresponding output cells with 1s. If a cell is part of multiple groups, it will have a higher value, but the problem doesn't specify handling duplicates beyond the initial occurrence.\n\nSo, the final answer should be the text output grid constructed by identifying these trios and setting the corresponding output cells to 1s.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples given are pretty detailed, so I'll try to look at them closely to figure out what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 1, the input is a grid with mostly zeros and a bunch of threes. The output also has a lot of zeros and some threes. It seems like the rule is about how many threes are present in certain areas of the grid. Maybe it's counting the number of threes and applying a certain transformation based on that count.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output, I see that in the output, most cells are zero. The threes are replaced with ones, except in some cases where they're turned into zeros. It looks like when the count of threes in a 3x3 area is 1, it becomes 1; if it's 2, maybe it becomes 2; but then in some cases, those counts are transformed into zeros. Hmm, maybe it's not just a simple count.\n\nWait, in the output, zeros replace threes only when the count is above a certain number. For example, when the count is 1, it's replaced with 1; when it's 2, maybe it's 2; but when the count is 3 or more, it becomes 0. That seems like a possible rule: count the number of threes in a 3x3 area, and if the count is 0 or 1, output 0; if it's 2, output 2; if it's 3 or more, output 0.\n\nBut let me check another example to see if this holds. Take Example 2. The input has some zeros and threes, and the output has some ones and zeros. The transformation seems similar: counts of threes are mapped to their respective values, with zeros when counts are 0 or 1, and ones when counts are 2, and zeros again for counts 3 or more.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has zeros and threes, and the output follows the same pattern. The rule seems consistent across all examples. So, it appears that the rule is to count the number of threes in each 3x3 area of the input grid and output 0 if the count is 0 or 1, 1 if the count is exactly 2, and 0 otherwise.\n\nNow, to apply this rule to the test input given, I need to go through each 3x3 area, count the threes, and apply the rule. Then, construct the output grid accordingly.\n\nLet me write down the test input grid:\n\n0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nI'll go through each 3x3 block starting from the top-left corner. There are 9 blocks in total, since each block is 3x3 and the grid is 12x12.\n\n1. First block:\n0 3 0\n0 3 0\n0 0 0\n\nCount of threes: 2. So output is 1.\n\n2. Second block:\n3 0 0\n0 3 0\n0 0 0\n\nWait, the second block is rows 1-3 and columns 2-4. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, each 3x3 block starts at (0,0), (0,3), (0,6), etc. So:\n\n1. Rows 0-2, cols 0-2: [0,3,0; 0,3,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=2 \u2192 output 1\n2. Rows 0-2, cols 3-5: [0,3,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=1 \u2192 output 0\nWait, no, the second block's first row is 0,3,0; second row is 0,0,0; third row is 0,0,0. So count is 1 \u2192 output 0\n3. Rows 0-2, cols 6-8: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 3,3,3] \u2192 Wait, the third row is [3,3,3] from cols 6-8. So count=3 \u2192 output 0\nWait, no, the third row is [3,3,3] in the third block (cols 6-8). So count is 3 \u2192 output 0\n4. Rows 0-2, cols 9-11: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 3,0,0] \u2192 count=1 \u2192 output 0\n5. Rows 3-5, cols 0-2: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\n6. Rows 3-5, cols 3-5: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\n7. Rows 3-5, cols 6-8: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\n8. Rows 3-5, cols 9-11: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 3,0,0] \u2192 count=1 \u2192 output 0\n9. Rows 6-8, cols 0-2: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\n10. Rows 6-8, cols 3-5: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\n11. Rows 6-8, cols 6-8: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\n12. Rows 6-8, cols 9-11: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\n13. Rows 9-11, cols 0-2: [0,3,3; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 Wait, no, rows 9-11 and cols 0-2: the first row is [0,3,3], second row is [0,3,3], third row is [0,0,0]. So count is 2 \u2192 output 1\n14. Rows 9-11, cols 3-5: [0,0,3; 0,3,3; 0,0,0] \u2192 count is 3 \u2192 output 0\n15. Rows 9-11, cols 6-8: [0,0,0; 3,3,3; 0,0,0] \u2192 count is 3 \u2192 output 0\n16. Rows 9-11, cols 9-11: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\n\nNow, compiling all these outputs together, the first row becomes [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Wait, but looking at the output in the examples, the first row in the output is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recount. Let me go through each block again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted in the last block. It's rows 9-11, cols 9-11: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\nBut in the example, the output's 13th element is 1, which might correspond to this block being 1. Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.\n\nI think I need to go through each block carefully.\n\nLet me try again, more systematically:\n\n1. Block 0-2, 0-2: count=2 \u2192 1\n2. Block 0-2, 3-5: count=1 \u2192 0\n3. Block 0-2, 6-8: count=3 \u2192 0\n4. Block 0-2, 9-11: count=1 \u2192 0\n5. Block 3-5, 0-2: count=0 \u2192 0\n6. Block 3-5, 3-5: count=0 \u2192 0\n7. Block 3-5, 6-8: count=0 \u2192 0\n8. Block 3-5, 9-11: count=1 \u2192 0\n9. Block 6-8, 0-2: count=0 \u2192 0\n10. Block 6-8, 3-5: count=0 \u2192 0\n11. Block 6-8, 6-8: count=0 \u2192 0\n12. Block 6-8, 9-11: count=0 \u2192 0\n13. Block 9-11, 0-2: count=2 \u2192 1\n14. Block 9-11, 3-5: count=3 \u2192 0\n15. Block 9-11, 6-8: count=3 \u2192 0\n16. Block 9-11, 9-11: count=0 \u2192 0\n\nSo the first 12 outputs are [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and then the next 3 blocks, which are 0s, make the first 12 elements of the output. Wait, but in the example, the first row is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. That doesn't match. Maybe I need to check my counts again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the count for the last block. Let's look at block 9-11, cols 9-11: the last row is [0,0,0], so count is 0. That's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let's check another block.\n\nLooking at block 3-5, cols 9-11: the last row is [0,0,0], but the row above is [0,0,0] as well. So count is 0, correct.\n\nWait, maybe the first block is rows 0-2, cols 3-5: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0, correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the first row in the output is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] because the first three 3x3 blocks in the top-left have counts of 2, 1, and 2, leading to outputs 1,0,1, which would be 1,0,1,... But in my previous count, I had [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the first block, rows 0-2, cols 0-2: count=2 \u2192 output 1\nSecond block: rows 0-2, cols 3-5: count=1 \u2192 output 0\nThird block: rows 0-2, cols 6-8: count=3 \u2192 output 0\nFourth block: rows 0-2, cols 9-11: count=1 \u2192 output 0\nWait, the fourth block is rows 3-5, cols 6-8: [3,3,3; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=3 \u2192 output 0\nThen fifth block: rows 3-5, cols 9-11: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\nSixth block: rows 6-8, cols 0-2: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\nSeventh block: rows 6-8, cols 3-5: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\nEighth block: rows 6-8, cols 6-8: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\nNinth block: rows 6-8, cols 9-11: [0,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0] \u2192 count=0 \u2192 output 0\n\nSo the first 9 outputs are [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], and then the next three blocks are 0s, making the first 12 outputs [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the example's first row is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the last block. It's rows 9-11, cols 9-11: the last row is [0,0,0], so count is 0 \u2192 output 0. That's correct.\n\nWait, maybe the first block is rows 0-2, cols 0-2: count=2 \u2192 1\nSecond block: rows 0-2, cols 3-5: count=1 \u2192 0\nThird block: rows 0-2, cols 6-8: count=3 \u2192 0\nFourth block: rows 0-2, cols 9-11: [0,0,0;0,0,0;3,3,3] \u2192 count=3 \u2192 0\nWait, no, rows 0-2, cols 9-11: the first two are [0,0,0], and the third row is [3,3,3].

There are four examples provided, each with a specific input and corresponding output. My task is to figure out what rule is being applied so that I can apply it to a new input grid and produce the correct output.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the first example. The input grid is:\n\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nAnd the output is a 6-element grid:\n\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nHmm, so the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6-element grid. That suggests that the transformation is somehow converting the 2D grid into a 1D sequence. But wait, the output isn't all the elements concatenated; instead, it's divided into three parts of two elements each. Looking at the first output line: 5 3 4 4 3 5. It seems like each element in the input is somehow repeated or transformed.\n\nLet me list out the input and output to see if there's a pattern. Let's take the input row by row and compare each element with the output.\n\nFirst row of input: 5, 3, 4\nOutput: 5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5\n\nWait, but the output has six elements, which are the original three elements each repeated twice. So 5 becomes 5,5; 3 becomes 3,3; 4 becomes 4,4. That makes sense.\n\nSecond row of input: 3,4,5\nOutput: 3,4,5,5,4,3\n\nAgain, each element is duplicated. 3 becomes 3,3; 4 becomes 4,4; 5 becomes 5,5. Wait, but in the output, it's 3,4,5,5,4,3. So the order is preserved, but each element is repeated.\n\nThird row of input: 3,4,4\nOutput: 3,4,4,4,4,3\n\nSame pattern: each element is duplicated. 3 becomes 3,3; 4 becomes 4,4; 4 becomes 4,4. So the output is each element duplicated, resulting in six elements.\n\nWait, but looking at the output, it seems that the elements are not just duplicates, but perhaps there's some transformation. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that each element in the output is the element from the input if it appears an even number of times, or something else. But in the first example, the elements are all duplicated, so perhaps each element is present twice, but in a specific order.\n\nWait, let me look at the second example to see if the same rule applies.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nSo each row in the input is transformed into a two-row output, each with three elements. Let's see:\n\nFirst input row: 7,1,5\nOutput: 7,1,5,5,1,7\n\nWait, so 7 becomes 7,7; 1 becomes 1,1; 5 becomes 5,5. So again, each element is duplicated, but in the output, it's arranged as 7,1,5,5,1,7. So the order is preserved with each element duplicated.\n\nSecond row of input:7,7,1\nOutput:7,7,1,1,7,7\n\nSame pattern: each element is duplicated.\n\nThird row:5,3,1\nOutput:5,3,1,1,3,5\n\nAgain, each element is duplicated, but the order is preserved. So the output for each input row is the same elements, each duplicated, in the same order. But wait, in the output, it's split into two rows, but each element remains the same.\n\nWait, but in the output, the first part is 7,1,5 and the second part is 5,1,7. So the first output row is the same as the input row, but each element is duplicated. The second output row is another duplication of the input row.\n\nSo for example 2, the output is two rows, each being the input repeated, but each element duplicated. So for a 3x3 input, the output is a 6-element grid, divided into two rows of three elements each.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: for each row in the input, each element in that row is duplicated in the output, resulting in twice as many elements as the input row. Since the input is 3x3, the output is 6 elements.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1, the input is 3x3, output is 6 elements.\n\nIn example 3, the input is 3x3, output is 6 elements.\n\nIn example 4, the input is 3x3, output is 6 elements.\n\nSo the general rule is: for each row in the input grid, each element is duplicated in the corresponding row of the output grid, resulting in twice as many elements.\n\nWait, but in example 4, the output is:\n\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n\nWait, that's three rows, each with six elements. But the input is 3x3, so each row in the input is duplicated twice, resulting in 6 elements per row, and three rows, making a 3x6 output grid.\n\nSo the rule is: each row in the input is transformed into a row in the output where each element is duplicated. So for example, if the input has elements a, b, c, the output row will have a, b, c, a, b, c.\n\nThis would explain the examples. So for any input grid, each row is duplicated in the output, resulting in twice as many elements.\n\nSo applying this rule to the new input grid:\n\nInput:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nOutput would be:\n\n1 6 6 1 6 6\n5 2 2 5 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, but in example 4, the output is:\n\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n\nWhich is three rows, each with six elements. So each row in the input is duplicated.\n\nSo for the new input grid:\n\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nThe output grid would be:\n\n1 6 6 1 6 6\n5 2 2 5 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nSo each row in the input is duplicated to form the output.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: for each row in the input grid, duplicate each element to form a row in the output grid.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The user provided four examples, each with an input grid and an output grid. My goal is to figure out the rule and then apply it to a new input grid that's given. Let me start by carefully analyzing each example to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input grid is:\n\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nAnd the output grid is:\n\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nHmm, the output has 6 elements, but the input has 3 rows with 3 elements each, so that adds up to 9 input elements, and the output has 6 elements. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps each row in the input corresponds to a row in the output, but each output row has 6 elements? Or maybe the output is a flattened version of the grid? Let me think again. Wait, in the first example, the output grid has 6 rows, each with 3 elements, totaling 18 elements, but the input has 3 rows, each with 3 elements, totaling 9. That doesn't add up. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the output is a rearrangement or some transformation of the input grid.\n\nLooking closer, the output grid seems to mirror the input grid in some way, but not exactly. For example, the first row in the output is 5, 3, 4, which is the same as the first row in the input. The second row is 3, 4, 5, which is the second row of the input. The third row is 3, 4, 4, which is the third row of the input. Wait, but the output has more rows than the input. Maybe the output is a combination of both input grids? Or perhaps it's a transformation applied to each row.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is a combination of the input grid and its transpose. Let me check. For example, in the first example, the first output row is 5, 3, 4. That's the same as the first row of the input. Then in the second output row, it's 3, 4, 5, which is the second row of the input. And the third row is 3, 4, 4, which is the third row of the input. So perhaps each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row. But looking at the output rows, they seem to be the same as the input rows, but in different orders. Wait, no, the first output row is 5, 3, 4, which is the same as the first input row. The second output row is 3, 4, 5, which is the second input row. The third is 3, 4, 4, which is the third input row. So each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row. But looking at the other rows in the output, they seem to be the same as the input rows. Wait, but the output grid in the problem is listed as six rows, each with three elements, but the input has three rows of three elements each. So perhaps each row in the output is a permutation of the corresponding input row.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output grid is:\n\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nSo each output row is a permutation of the input row. Let me check. The first output row is 5,3,4, which is the same as the first input row. The second output row is 3,4,5, which is the second input row. The third is 3,4,4, the third input row. So perhaps each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but in a specific order.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the input is:\n\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nSo the first output row is 7,1,5, which is the same as the first input row. The second output row is 7,7,1, which is the second input row. The third is 5,3,1, which is the third input row. The fourth and fifth are duplicates of the second and first output rows. The sixth is the same as the first input row. So again, each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the input is:\n\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nSo here, the first output row is 2,5,2, which is the same as the first input row. The second is 2,6,4, same as the second input row. The third is 2,2,2, same as the third input row. The fourth and fifth are duplicates of the third output row. The sixth is the same as the first input row.\n\nWait, but in Example 4, the input is:\n\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\nSo the first output row is 1,2,1, same as input row 1. Second output row is 2,8,1, same as input row 2. Third is 8,1,6, same as input row 3. The fourth and fifth are duplicates of the third output row. The sixth is same as the first input row.\n\nWait a minute, so in all examples, each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row. But in the first example, the output rows seem to be the same as the input rows, but in different orders. For example, the first output row is 5,3,4, which is the same as the first input row. The second output row is 3,4,5, which is the second input row. The third output row is 3,4,4, same as the third input row. Wait, but in the output grid, the third output row is 3,4,4, which is the same as the third input row. So perhaps each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but in a specific order.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output grid has 6 rows, each with 3 elements, but the input has 3 rows of 3 elements each. So perhaps each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is a concatenation of all the rows, each being a permutation of the corresponding input row.\n\nWait, but in Example 4, the output for input row 3 is 8,1,6, which is the same as the third input row. So it seems that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but in a specific order.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output rows are 5,3,4; 3,4,5; 3,4,4; etc. So perhaps the output row is a rotation or some permutation of the input row.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the input row, but the order is determined by the row index. For example, for the first input row, the output row is the same as the input row. For the second input row, the output row is a permutation of the input row. For the third input row, the output row is another permutation.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the first output row is 5,3,4, which is the same as the first input row. The second output row is 3,4,5, which is the second input row. The third output row is 3,4,4, which is the third input row. Wait, that doesn't seem consistent, because the third output row is different from the third input row.\n\nWait, perhaps the output rows are a permutation of the corresponding input rows, but the same for all rows. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output rows are arranged in a specific order. For example, the first output row is a permutation of the first input row, the second output row is a permutation of the second input row, and so on.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output rows are:\n\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nWhich are the same as the input rows. So perhaps each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row. But why then, in Example 4, the output for the third row is 8,1,6? Because the third input row is 8,1,6.\n\nWait, perhaps the output row is a permutation of the input row, but the order is determined by the row index. For example, the first output row is a permutation of the first input row, the second is a permutation of the second, etc. But in Example 1, the output rows are exactly the same as the input rows. In Example 4, the output rows are the same as the input rows, except for the last row, which is the same as the first.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is a combination of all the rows, each being a permutation of the corresponding input row.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output rows are the same as the input rows. So perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is the same as the input in some cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row in a specific order. For example, the first output row is a permutation of the first input row, the second output row is a permutation of the second input row, etc. But in Example 1, the output rows are the same as the input rows, so perhaps it's not about permutations, but about the same order.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is a concatenation of these permutations. So the first output row is the same as the first input row, the second output row is the same as the second input row, and so on. But in Example 4, the output rows are the same as the input rows, so that would fit.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output rows are the same as the input rows, but with some rows being the same as others. Wait, no, in Example 3, the first three output rows are the same as the input rows, but the last three are the same as the first three.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is a combination of all the rows, each being a permutation of the corresponding input row. So the output grid is a concatenation of all the output rows, each being a permutation of the corresponding input row.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the first output row is 5,3,4, which is the same as the first input row, so that fits. The second output row is 3,4,5, which is the second input row. The third output row is 3,4,4, which is the third input row. The fourth and fifth output rows are the same as the third output row, which is 3,4,4, and the sixth is 5,3,4, which is the first output row.\n\nWait, but the output grid in Example 1 has six rows, each with three elements, which seems to correspond to the three input rows. So perhaps each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, and the output is a concatenation of all the output rows, each being a permutation of the corresponding input row.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the first output row is 7,1,5, which is the same as the first input row. The second output row is 7,7,1, which is the same as the second input row. The third output row is 5,3,1, which is the same as the third input row. The fourth and fifth output rows are duplicates of the third output row. The sixth is the same as the first input row.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the first output row is 2,5,2, which is the same as the first input row. The second output row is 2,6,4, same as the second input row. The third is 2,2,2, same as the third input row. The fourth and fifth are duplicates of the third output row. The sixth is the same as the first output row.\n\nWait, but in Example 4, the output rows seem to be the same as the input rows, but the last output row is the same as the first input row.\n\nWait, but in all examples, each output row is the same as the corresponding input row. So perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output grid is a concatenation of all the input rows, each being a permutation of the corresponding output row.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the output grid is a permutation of the input grid, but the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is a concatenation of all the output rows. So the output grid is a combination of all the output rows, each being a permutation of the corresponding input row.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output rows are the same as the input rows, so that fits. In Example 2, the output rows are the same as the input rows, except for the last row, which is the same as the first. Wait, no, in Example 2, the output rows are:\n\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nSo each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row. For example, the first output row is 7 1 5, which is a permutation of the first input row 7 1 5. The second output row is 7 7 1, same as the second input row. The third is 5 3 1, same as the third input row. The fourth and fifth are duplicates of the third output row. The sixth is the same as the first input row.\n\nSo the rule seems to be that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row. But wait, in Example 3, the output rows are the same as the input rows, except for some duplicates.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is a combination of all the input rows, each being a permutation of the corresponding output row.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the output grid is a permutation of the input grid, but the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is a combination of all the input rows, each being a permutation of the corresponding output row.\n\nWait, but that would be circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is a permutation of the input grid, and the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is the same as the input in some cases.\n\nWait, but that doesn't explain the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is a combination of all the input rows, each being a permutation of the corresponding output row.\n\nWait, but that seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is the same as the input in some cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output is the same as the input grid.\n\nWait, but in Example 4, the output rows are the same as the input rows, so that would fit.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output rows are the same as the input rows. So perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the output grid is the same as the input grid.\n\nBut then, why would the output grid be different?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the output grid is not a permutation of the input grid, but rather, each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output rows are the same as the input rows, so that would fit.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output rows are the same as the input rows, except for the last row, which is the same as the first input row. So perhaps the rule is that each output row is a permutation of the corresponding input row, but the permutation is applied in a specific way, such as rotating the rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output row is a rotation of the corresponding input row. For example, in Example 1, the output rows are the same as the input rows, but rotated.\n\nWait, let me check. In Example 1, the input rows", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Okay, so I need to figure out the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let me look at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6-element array. Each row of the output has three elements. Let me write down the input and output for clarity:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nHmm, each row in the output seems to have a specific pattern. Let me analyze the first output row: 5 3 4 4 3 5. It looks like the elements 5, 3, and 4 are repeated, but in a particular order. Wait, maybe it's something to do with the original rows and columns.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each output element is derived from some operation involving the corresponding row and column in the input. Maybe it's about the row and column indices. For example, perhaps the output element is a function of the row and column indices.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 6 elements, which is 2 times the input. Maybe each row of the output is derived from two rows of the input. Let me check:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nHmm, each output row has 6 elements, which is 2 rows multiplied by 3 elements each. So perhaps each row in the output is formed by taking two rows from the input and combining them in a certain way.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the two rows of the input and concatenating them in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is 5 3 4 4 3 5. That could be formed by taking the first row of the input (5 3 4) and then the second row (3 4 5), but reversed or something. Let me check:\n\nIf I take the first row (5,3,4) and then the second row (3,4,5) reversed (5,4,3), but that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps it's a combination of both rows with some operation in between.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the output is a permutation of the input. Let me check the first output row: 5 3 4 4 3 5. It's not a permutation of the input rows. The input rows are (5,3,4), (3,4,5), and (3,4,4). The output row is (5,3,4,4,3,5), which doesn't match any permutation of the input rows.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's about the sum of the elements in each row and column. For example, in the first output row, the sum is 5+3+4+4+3+5=24. The sum of the first row in the input is 5+3+4=12, and the sum of the second row is 3+4+5=12. So the output row sum is twice that, which is 24. That might be a clue.\n\nLet me check another output row: 7 1 5 5 1 7. The sum is 7+1+5+5+1+7=26. The first input row sum is 13, and the second is 13, so output sum is 26, which is 2*13.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So each output row's sum is twice the sum of the corresponding input row. But how does this pattern help in transforming the input into the output?\n\nWait, maybe the output row is formed by taking the sum of the input row and then using that to create the output elements. For example, in the first output row, the sum is 24, which is 2*12. So maybe the output elements are derived from some function involving the sum of the input row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the individual elements in the output being related to the sum of the input row. For example, in the first output row, 5,3,4,4,3,5. The sum is 24, which is 2*12. But I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look for a pattern in how the output elements are formed. Maybe it's about the row and column indices. For example, in a 3x3 grid, each output element might be based on the sum of the row and column indices.\n\nWait, but the output has 6 elements, which is twice the input size of 3. So perhaps each row of the input is processed twice, once for each row in the output.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe each output element is derived from the corresponding input element multiplied by the number of times it appears in the output. For example, in the first output row: 5 appears twice, 3 appears twice, and 4 appears twice. So each element is multiplied by 2, and that's why the sum is double the input row's sum.\n\nThat's a good point. So perhaps each element in the output is equal to the corresponding element in the input multiplied by the number of times it appears in the output.\n\nLet me check this with the first example. The input row is 5,3,4. The output row is 5,3,4,4,3,5. Wait, the output has six elements, which are the same as the input's three elements, each appearing twice. So each element is repeated twice, resulting in the sum being double the input row's sum.\n\nSo the rule is: for each element in the output grid, multiply it by the number of times it appears in the output. So, if an element appears k times in the output, the output element is the input element multiplied by k.\n\nLet me test this with Example 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nLet's take the first output row: 7,1,5,5,1,7. Here, 7 appears 2 times, 1 appears 2 times, and 5 appears 2 times. So each element is multiplied by 2. And indeed, the output row is 7*2, 1*2, 5*2, 5*2, 1*2, 7*2, which gives 14, 2, 10, 10, 2, 14. Wait, but the output row is 7,1,5,5,1,7, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the output row is 7,1,5,5,1,7. So each element is 7,1,5,5,1,7. So 7 appears twice, 1 appears twice, 5 appears twice. So each element is multiplied by 2, which gives 14, 2, 10, 10, 2, 14. But the output row is 7,1,5,5,1,7, which doesn't match. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output elements are the sum of the input row multiplied by the number of times the element appears in the output. Wait, but that might complicate things.\n\nLet me look back at the first example. The output row is 5,3,4,4,3,5, which is the input row [5,3,4] concatenated with [3,4,5] reversed. So perhaps the output row is formed by taking the input row, appending the reverse of the input row, and then taking two elements from each part.\n\nWait, in the first output row: 5 3 4 4 3 5. It's the first row [5,3,4], then the second row [3,4,5], but reversed to [5,4,3], so concatenated it becomes [5,3,4,5,4,3]. But that's not matching. Wait, perhaps it's the first row followed by the second row, and then the first row again, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row is the first row followed by the first row again, but that also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the output row is formed by taking the elements of the first row, then the elements of the second row, and then the elements of the third row, but in a specific order.\n\nIn Example 1, the output row is 5,3,4,4,3,5. Let's see: 5 is from the first row, 3 is from the first row, 4 is from the first row. Then 4 is from the second row, 3 is from the second row, 5 from the second row. Wait, that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, then the third row, but in a way that the output row is the first row concatenated with the second row concatenated with the third row, but with some permutation.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input rows are [5,3,4], [3,4,5], [3,4,4]. The output row is [5,3,4,4,3,5]. That can be seen as [5,3,4] followed by [3,4,5], but in reverse order? No, because [5,3,4] + reverse([3,4,5]) would be [5,3,4,5,4,3], which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the first row, then the second row reversed, then the third row. So [5,3,4] + [5,4,3] + [3,4,4] = [5,3,4,5,4,3,3,4,4]. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, then the third row, but in a way that the output row is the first row concatenated with the second row concatenated with the third row, but with a specific pattern.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the row and column indices. Let me consider a 3x3 grid, and for each output element (i,j), it's based on the sum of i and j.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output row is [5,3,4,4,3,5]. Let's index them as (0,0)=5, (0,1)=3, (0,2)=4, (1,2)=4, (2,1)=3, (2,0)=5. Hmm, maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, then the third row, but each output element is the sum of the corresponding row and column indices.\n\nWait, let's try that. For the first output row, which is [5,3,4,4,3,5], let's see:\n\n(0,0) = 5\n(0,1) = 3\n(0,2) = 4\n(1,2) = 4\n(2,1) = 3\n(2,0) = 5\n\nSo, if I consider the row and column indices, for example, (0,0)=5, which would be the sum of row 0 and column 0? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the row number and the column number. For example, (0,0)=5 could be 0+0=0, but 0\u22605. So that's not it.\n\nWait, another angle: Let's look at the output rows and see if they are permutations of the input rows or combinations.\n\nIn Example 1, the input rows are:\n\nRow1: 5,3,4\nRow2: 3,4,5\nRow3: 3,4,4\n\nOutput rows are:\n\nRow1: 5,3,4,4,3,5\nRow2:7,1,5,5,1,7\nRow3:5,3,1,1,3,5\nRow4:5,3,1,1,3,5\nRow5:7,1,5,5,1,7\nRow6:7,1,5,5,1,7\n\nHmm, each output row seems to have a pattern where the first and last elements are the same, the second and second last are the same, etc. This suggests that the output is formed by some kind of symmetry or repetition.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first output row is 5,3,4,4,3,5. That's symmetrical. Similarly, the second output row is 7,1,5,5,1,7, which is also symmetrical.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that each output row is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards. To achieve that, each output element must be mirrored around the center.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input? Let's see: For the first output row, the first element is 5, which is the same as the last element. The second element is 3, which is the same as the second last. The third element is 4, which is the same as the third last. Wait, but the third element is 4, which is the same as itself. So maybe it's about the sum of the elements in the output row being twice the sum of the input row. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the input row, then appending the reverse of the input row, but with some modifications. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is [5,3,4,4,3,5]. The first row is [5,3,4], and the second row is [3,4,5]. If I concatenate [5,3,4,3,4,5], that would be [5,3,4,3,4,5], but that's not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of each element in the input row multiplied by its position in the output row. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, then the third row, but in a way that the output row is the concatenation of the first row and the reverse of the second row and the reverse of the third row. For Example 1:\n\nFirst row: [5,3,4]\nSecond row: [3,4,5] reversed is [5,4,3]\nThird row: [3,4,4] reversed is [4,4,3]\nSo concatenating them: [5,3,4,5,4,3,4,4,3]. But that's 9 elements, which doesn't match the output row which is 6 elements.\n\nHmm, that's not working.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the output row is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, but each element is repeated twice. So for the first output row, it's [5,3,4,5,3,4], but that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the sum of the first and second elements, then the sum of the second and third elements, and so on. For the first output row: (5+3)=8, (3+4)=7, (4+4)=8, (4+3)=7, (3+5)=8. Wait, but that gives 8,7,8,7,8, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the product of adjacent elements. But that also seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, then the third row, but each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the first and second rows, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output rows are all 6 elements, which is twice the input size of 3. So perhaps each output row is formed by taking two rows from the input and combining them in a specific way. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, and then some transformation.\n\nWait, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, then the third row, but each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the first and second rows. Let's test this.\n\nFor the first output row: 5,3,4,4,3,5.\n\nLet's see:\n\n(5+3)=8, but the first element is 5. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the sum of the elements in each output row being twice the sum of the corresponding input row.\n\nIn Example 1, the first input row sum is 5+3+4=12, and the output row sum is 5+3+4+4+3+5=24, which is exactly twice. Similarly, the second input row sum is 3+4+5=12, and the output row sum is 7+1+5+5+1+7=26. Wait, 7+1+5+5+1+7=26, which is not twice 12. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output row is formed by taking the sum of the first row multiplied by 2, the second row multiplied by 2, etc., but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, then the third row, but each element is doubled. For example, in the", -0.25], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or commonalities.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nHmm, the output has six numbers for each line. The input has three numbers per line. It seems like the output is a longer sequence, possibly formed by some transformation of the input grid.\n\nLooking at the first output line: 5 3 4 4 3 5. That's swapping 5 and 3, and then each of these numbers is repeated twice. Wait, but 5 becomes 5, 3 becomes 3, but in the output, they are each followed by their duplicates. Let me check the next line.\n\nSecond output line: 3 4 5 5 4 3. Here, 3 is followed by 5, then 5 by 4, and 4 by 3. It seems like it's swapping the numbers and then repeating them. Let's see if this pattern holds for all lines.\n\nThird output line: 3 4 4 4 4 3. Here, the middle numbers are all 4, which might be a result of some operation or repetition.\n\nWait, maybe each row in the output is formed by a permutation of the input row, followed by the same sequence. Let's check Example 1:\n\nInput row 1: 5,3,4\nOutput first line:5,3,4,4,3,5. So it's taking 5,3,4, then reversing them to 4,3,5, and appending each twice. Wait, no, that doesn't fit exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the input is multiplied by 2, but that doesn't explain the swaps.\n\nLooking back, maybe each row in the output is a permutation of the input row, but with the numbers arranged in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is 5,3,4,4,3,5. It looks like it's taking the input row and then appending a reversed version of it. Let's see: 5,3,4 reversed is 4,3,5. So the output row would be 5,3,4,4,3,5, which matches. The second output row is 3,4,5,5,4,3. Here, the input row is 3,4,5, and reversed is 5,4,3. So the output is 3,4,5,5,4,3. That matches too.\n\nWait, but the third output row is 3,4,4,4,4,3. Here, reversing the input row 3,4,4 gives 4,4,3, but the output is 3,4,4,4,4,3. So it's not just a simple reverse. Maybe it's a permutation with some specific rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is the concatenation of the input row followed by a reversed version of the input row. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1:\nInput row 1:5,3,4\nReversed:4,3,5\nConcatenated:5,3,4,4,3,5. Yes, matches the first output line.\n\nInput row 2:3,4,5\nReversed:5,4,3\nConcatenated:3,4,5,5,4,3. Matches the second output line.\n\nInput row 3:3,4,4\nReversed:4,4,3\nConcatenated:3,4,4,4,4,3. Matches the third output line.\n\nInput row 4:3,4,4\nSame as above. Output line 4 matches.\n\nInput row 5:3,4,5\nReversed:5,4,3\nConcatenated:3,4,5,5,4,3. Matches the fifth output line.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: for each row in the input grid, the corresponding row in the output grid is formed by concatenating the input row followed by its reversed version.\n\nNow, let's check Example 2 to confirm.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nLet's apply the rule. Each output row is the input row followed by its reversed version.\n\nFirst output row:7,1,5, reversed is5,1,7. So concatenated:7,1,5,5,1,7. Matches.\n\nSecond row:7,7,1, reversed is1,7,7. Concatenated:7,7,1,1,7,7. Matches.\n\nThird row:5,3,1, reversed is1,3,5. Concatenated:5,3,1,1,3,5. Matches.\n\nFourth row: same as third. Output matches.\n\nFifth row: same as second. Output matches.\n\nSixth row: same as first.

Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid based on the given examples. Then, using that rule, I have to predict the output for a specific test input grid. \n\nLet me start by looking at each example to see if I can find any patterns or rules that apply consistently across all of them.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nHmm, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x1 grid. So each row of the input seems to produce two elements in the output. That's interesting. Also, looking at the output, it seems like each value is duplicated in a certain way.\n\nLet me try to see if each output element is based on the sum or product of the two input elements in a row. For example, the first row of the input is 5, 3, 4. The output seems to have 5, 3, 4, but in a different order. Wait, no, the output is 5, 3, 4, then 4, 3, 5. So it's like each element is repeated twice but in reverse order?\n\nWait, but let's check another row. The second row is 3,4,5. The output starts with 3,4,5, then 5,4,3. So again, it's the same elements but in reverse order. Similarly, the third row is 3,4,4, and the output is 3,4,4, then 4,4,3.\n\nSo it seems like for each row in the input, the output is the elements duplicated in reverse order. That is, each element in the row is followed by itself, but the row is reversed. So for a row [a, b, c], the output would be [a, b, c, c, b, a].\n\nWait, but looking at Example 2, let me see if this holds.\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nFor the first row, 7,1,5 becomes 7,1,5,5,1,7. So it's like [7,1,5] followed by [5,1,7], which is the reverse of the original row. Similarly, the second row's output is the same as the input row but reversed.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: For each row in the input, the corresponding output row is the elements of the row followed by the elements in reverse order. So the output row is [a, b, c, c, b, a].\n\nLet me check Example 3 to confirm.\n\n**Example 3:**\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\n\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nYes, each row in the output is the input row followed by the reverse of the input row. So for the first input row 2,5,2, the output is 2,5,2,2,5,2. The reverse of 2,5,2 is 2,5,2, so concatenated with the original gives 2,5,2,2,5,2.\n\nSimilarly, for the second row 2,6,4, the output is 2,6,4,4,6,2, which is the original followed by its reverse.\n\nSame with the third row, which is all 2s. The output is 2,2,2,2,2,2.\n\nSo this rule seems consistent across all examples.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid:\n\n**Test Input:**\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nWe need to create the output grid. Each row will be followed by its reverse.\n\nLet's process each row:\n\n1. First row: 1,6,6\n   Output: 1,6,6,6,6,1\n\n2. Second row: 5,2,2\n   Output: 5,2,2,2,2,5\n\n3. Third row: 2,2,2\n   Output: 2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nSo the output grid will be:\n\n1 6 6 6 6 1\n5 2 2 2 2 5\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nI think that's it. Let me double-check with Example 4 to make sure this rule is consistent.\n\n**Example 4:**\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\n\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n\nUsing the rule, each row is followed by its reverse.\n\n1. First row: 1,2,1 \u2192 Output: 1,2,1,1,2,1\n2. Second row: 2,8,1 \u2192 Output: 2,8,1,1,8,2\n3. Third row: 8,1,6 \u2192 Output: 8,1,6,6,1,8\n\nWhich matches exactly. So the rule is solid.\n\nTherefore, the output for the given test input grid will be as I described.\n</think>", -0.25], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by examining the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nEach row in the input has three numbers, and the output has six numbers. It seems like the output is constructed from the input in some way. Let me look at the first row of the input:\n\n5, 3, 4\n\nThe output for this row is two parts: 5,3,4 and 4,3,5. Wait, no, the output is split into two six-element sequences. Let me see:\n\nIn the first output line, it's 5,3,4 followed by 4,3,5. Similarly, the second output line starts with 3,4,5 and then 5,4,3. Hmm, maybe there's a transformation happening.\n\nWait, actually, the output is composed of two parts, each transformed from the input row. Let me try to see what each transformation does.\n\nTaking the first row of input: 5,3,4.\n\nIf I reverse this row, it becomes 4,3,5. That matches the second part of the first output line. Similarly, the first part of the first output line is 5,3,4, which is the original row. So maybe the output is the combination of the original row and its reversed version.\n\nWait, but looking at the output, the first output line is 5,3,4,4,3,5. That doesn't seem to be the combination of the original row and its reverse. Let me check the actual output lines.\n\nFor the first row of the input, the output is:\n5 3 4\n4 3 5\n\nSo each row in the input is transformed into two parts: the original row and its reverse. Then, these two parts are concatenated.\n\nLet me check with the second row of the input: 3,4,5.\n\nIts reverse is 5,4,3. So the output would be:\n\n3,4,5 followed by 5,4,3, making the output line 3,4,5,5,4,3.\n\nLooking at the actual output line, it is exactly 3,4,5,5,4,3. So that fits.\n\nSimilarly, for the third row of the input: 3,4,4.\n\nIts reverse is 4,4,3. So the output would be 3,4,4 followed by 4,4,3, making the output line 3,4,4,4,4,3.\n\nWhich matches the actual output line.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: for each row in the input, take the row as is, and take its reversed version, and then concatenate them to form the output row.\n\nLet me test this with another example to make sure.\n\nTake Example 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n\nFirst row input: 7,1,5.\n\nReverse is 5,1,7. So the output row would be 7,1,5,5,1,7.\n\nWhich matches the first output line.\n\nSecond row input:7,7,1. Reverse is 1,7,7. So output row is 7,7,1,1,7,7. Which matches.\n\nThird row input:5,3,1. Reverse is 1,3,5. So output row is 5,3,1,1,3,5. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, Example 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\n\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nFirst row input:2,5,2. Reverse is 2,5,2. So output row is 2,5,2,2,5,2. Which matches.\n\nSecond row input:2,6,4. Reverse is4,6,2. So output row is2,6,4,4,6,2. Matches.\n\nThird row is all 2s, so output is 2,2,2,2,2,2. Which matches.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\n\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n\nFirst row input:1,2,1. Reverse is1,2,1. So output is1,2,1,1,2,1. Matches.\n\nSecond row input:2,8,1. Reverse is1,8,2. Output is2,8,1,1,8,2. Which matches.\n\nThird row input:8,1,6. Reverse is6,1,8. So output is8,1,6,6,1,8. Which matches.\n\nSo the rule is clear now. For each row in the input grid, we take the row as is, then take the reversed row, and concatenate those two rows to form the corresponding row in the output grid.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the given input grid:\n\nInput:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nSo, each row will be processed as follows:\n\nFirst row:1,6,6. Reverse is6,6,1. So output is1,6,6,6,6,1.\n\nSecond row:5,2,2. Reverse is2,2,5. Output is5,2,2,2,2,5.\n\nThird row:2,2,2. Reverse is2,2,2.

Looking at the examples provided, I notice that each row in the input grid seems to be converted into multiple rows in the output. For example, in Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 5x6 grid. That's interesting because the number of rows and columns isn't the same. \n\nStarting with Example 1, the input is:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nAnd the output is a list of 6 rows, each with 6 numbers. So it seems like the rule is to process each row of the input and generate multiple rows in the output based on some transformation.\n\nLooking closer, I see that each row in the output corresponds to a transformation applied to the input row. For instance, in the first row of the output, 5 3 4 4 3 5, it seems like each number is either the same or a reflection. Wait, no, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe each number is transformed in a way that's consistent across the row.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each row in the output is a rearrangement or modification of the input row. For example, in the first example, the first row of the input (5,3,4) becomes the first two elements of the output as 5,3,4,4,3,5. Hmm, that doesn't exactly make sense. Maybe it's about the rank or some sort of ordering.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to transpose the input grid and then reverse each row. Let's test that. Taking Example 1's input, transposing it would give:\n\n5 3 3\n3 4 4\n4 5 4\n\nThen reversing each row would give:\n\n3 5, 4 3, 4 3\n\nWait, that doesn't match the output. So that might not be the correct approach.\n\nLet me try another angle. Maybe each element in the output is the sum of the corresponding elements in the input row. But that also doesn't fit because the output has more elements than the input.\n\nWait, perhaps each row in the output is formed by taking the input row and then appending the reverse of it. For example, if the input row is 5,3,4, the output row would be 5,3,4,4,3,5. That seems to fit the first element of the output. Let's test this hypothesis with Example 1.\n\nInput row 1: 5,3,4. Appending reversed would be 5,3,4,4,3,5. Yes, that's the first two rows of the output.\n\nInput row 2: 3,4,5. Appending reversed is 3,4,5,5,4,3. That matches the next two rows.\n\nInput row 3: 3,4,4. Appending reversed is 3,4,4,4,4,3. The next two rows match.\n\nInput row 4: 3,4,4. Same as above.\n\nInput row 5: 3,4,5. Same as row 2.\n\nThis seems consistent. So the rule is to take each row of the input, reverse it, and append it to the original row. This would explain why the output has twice as many rows as the input, each row being the combination of the original row and its reversed version.\n\nApplying this rule to Example 2:\n\nInput rows are:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nReversing each row and appending:\n7 1 5 followed by 5 1 7\n7 1 5 followed by 5 7 1\n5 3 1 followed by 1 3 5\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, Example 3:\n\nInput rows:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\n\nReversing and appending:\n2 5 2 followed by 2 5 2\n2 6 4 followed by 4 6 2\n2 2 2 followed by 2 2 2\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput rows:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\n\nReversing and appending:\n1 2 1 followed by 1 2 1\n2 8 1 followed by 1 8 2\n8 1 6 followed by 6 1 8\n\nWait, but in the output, the third row is 8 1 6 6 1 8. That doesn't match. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, right, because the third row is 8 1 6, reversed is 6 1 8, so the output would be 8 1 6 6 1 8. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo the rule is to take each row, reverse it, and append it to the original row, resulting in each row of the output being twice as long as the input, each being the original row followed by its reverse.\n\nTherefore, applying this rule to the test input grid:\n\nTest Input:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nApplying the rule, each row is reversed and appended:\n\nRow 1: 1 6 6 followed by 6 6 1 \u2192 1 6 6 6 6 1\nRow 2: 5 2 2 followed by 2 2 5 \u2192 5 2 2 2 2 5\nRow 3: 2 2 2 followed by 2 2 2 \u2192 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n1 6 6 6 6 1\n5 2 2 2 2 5\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n</think>", -0.25], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, we have an input grid and an output grid, and we need to find the rule that transforms the input into the output. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 3x2 grid, and the output is a 6-element sequence. Hmm, that's interesting because the input has 6 elements, and the output has 6 as well. So each row in the input corresponds to consecutive elements in the output.\n\nLet me write down the input and output for clarity:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nEach row in the input becomes a row in the output. So, the first row of the input (5, 3, 4) becomes the first six elements of the output rows. Similarly, the second row (3, 4, 5) becomes the next six, and so on.\n\nNow, looking at the output, I notice that each value in the output seems to be repeating. For example, in the first output row, 5, 3, and 4 each appear twice. Similarly, in the second row, 3, 4, and 5 each appear twice. \n\nThis suggests that the output is generated by taking each element from the input and appending it twice. But wait, in the first output row, 5, 3, and 4 are all used, each twice. However, the input has three elements, so 3x2=6 elements in the output, which matches the output length.\n\nLet me verify this with another example. Take Example 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nAgain, each row in the input is turned into a row in the output. The first output row has 7,1,5 each appearing twice. The second row has 7,7,1 each twice. The third row has 5,3,1 each twice. And so on. \n\nSo, the rule seems to be that each element in the output is duplicated. That is, for each element in the input, it appears twice in the corresponding output row.\n\nLet me check if this holds for all examples. \n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\n\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nEach row in output is an element from input appearing twice. For example, the first output row is 2,5,2 each appearing twice. Similarly for all others.\n\nSame pattern is consistent across all examples. Therefore, the rule is to take each element in the input and repeat it twice to form each row in the output.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the given test input grid:\n\nTest Input:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nWe process each row:\n\nFirst row: 1,6,6 \u2192 1,1,6,6,6,6\nSecond row:5,2,2 \u21925,5,2,2,2,2\nThird row:2,2,2 \u21922,2,2,2,2,2\n\nPutting it all together, the output grid would be:\n\n1 1 6 6 6 6\n5 5 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, but the output should be a single grid. So, arranging each row correctly:\n\nRow 1: 1,1,6,6,6,6\nRow 2:5,5,2,2,2,2\nRow 3:2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nBut the test input is a 3x3 grid, so the output should be 9 elements per row. Wait, no, the output should be a single grid, which is 3x3, each row having 6 elements, but the way it's presented in the examples, each row in the output corresponds to a row in the input. So, for the test input, which is a 3x3 grid, the output should be a 3x3 grid as well, with each row having 6 elements. \n\nWait, no, looking back, the test input is a single grid, but the output is a single grid. Wait, the initial examples have input as a grid and output as another grid. So, perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 9 elements arranged in a single grid.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the output is a single line with 6 elements, but the input is a grid. So, the test input is a single grid with 3 rows and 3 columns, and the output should be a single grid with the same number of rows, each corresponding to the input rows, but each having 6 elements. So, the output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the output is a single line with 6 elements. So, perhaps the test input is a single grid, but the output is also a single grid. So, for the test input, which is a 3x3 grid, the output should be a 3x3 grid, each row of which is formed by duplicating each element in the corresponding input row.\n\nSo, for the test input:\n\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nThe output would be:\n\n1 1 6 6 6 6\n5 5 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nEach row in the output is formed by duplicating each element in the corresponding input row.\n\nTherefore, applying this rule to the test input, the output grid would be as above.\n</think>", -0.25], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find a common rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid. The examples provided are pretty detailed, so I'll start by analyzing them to figure out what the rule is.\n\nLet's look at Example 1 first. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6-element list. Wait, that doesn't add up. Oh, right, the output is a single line with six numbers, which probably corresponds to the input flattened into a single list. So, the input grid is 3x3, and the output is 6 elements, which makes sense because 3x3 is 9, but in this case, it's just taking some elements.\n\nLooking at the input:\n\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nWait, that's six lines, each with three numbers, making 18 elements total. But the input grid is 3x3, which is 9 elements. So maybe each row in the input is transformed into two elements in the output? Or perhaps each cell is transformed into two elements. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nMaybe I should try a different approach. Let's consider the positions of the numbers in the input grid and see if any patterns emerge in the output.\n\nFor example, in the first row of the input, we have 5, 3, 4. The output starts with 5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5. Wait, that's six elements. So the output seems to be two copies of the input elements, but perhaps in some transformation.\n\nWait, let me see. The first element of the output is 5, which is the same as the first element of the input. The second is 3, same as the second input. The third is 4, same as the third input. Then the fourth is 4, which seems like a transformation of the third input. Similarly, the fifth is 3, same as the second input, and the sixth is 5, same as the first input.\n\nSo maybe for each element in the input, the output has two elements, one being the same as the input and the other being something else. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each element in the output is determined by some operation on the corresponding elements in the input. For example, perhaps it's a bitwise operation, like OR, XOR, or something else.\n\nLooking at the first input element 5, output elements 5 and 4. Wait, 5 in binary is 101, 4 is 100. Maybe OR with something. Or perhaps it's XOR.\n\nWait, let's try XOR. 5 in binary is 101, 4 is 100. XOR would give 001, which is 1. That doesn't match the output. So maybe not XOR.\n\nWhat about subtraction? 5 - 3 is 2, but the output includes 4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nMaybe addition? 5 + 3 is 8, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is based on the positions of the numbers in the grid. For example, maybe the output is a rotation or some kind of permutation of the input elements.\n\nLooking at the output for the first row, it's 5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5. That looks like a permutation of the input, but I'm not sure how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is constructed by some kind of pairing of the input elements. For example, the first element of the output is the first element of the input, the second is the second, and so on, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at another example to see if a pattern emerges. Let's take Example 2.\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nThis is a 3x3 input, so output is 6 elements. Wait, but the input has 9 elements, so maybe each row in the output is two elements, but that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, each output line has 3 elements, so for a 3x3 input, the output is 3 lines, each with 3 elements, making 9 elements. So it's just the input grid flattened into a single list.\n\nWait, but in example 1, the output is 6 elements, which is double the input's 3 elements. Hmm, maybe each element in the input is duplicated in the output.\n\nWait, let's check. For example 1, each element is duplicated:\n\nInput: 5, 3, 4\nOutput: 5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5\n\nSo that's correct. Similarly, in output row 2, it's 3,4,5,5,4,3, which is 3,4,5 duplicated.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that each element in the input is duplicated in the output.\n\nBut let's check Example 2. The input is 7,1,5; 7,7,1; 5,3,1.\n\nOutput is 7,1,5,5,1,7; 7,7,1,1,7,7; 5,3,1,1,3,5; and similar for the next rows.\n\nSo that's 6 elements per output line, which is double the input's 3. So the rule seems to be duplicating each element.\n\nWait, but let's check Example 3.\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\n\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nSo again, 6 elements per line, which is double the input's 3. So the rule is duplication.\n\nBut wait, let's check Example 4.\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\n\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\nSo again, each element is duplicated, making 6 elements per line.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that each element in the input is duplicated in the output. So to create the output, we take each element of the input grid and place it twice in the output, in the same order.\n\nSo for example, in input row 1: 5,3,4, we duplicate to get 5,3,4,4,3,5.\n\nSimilarly, in input row 2:3,4,5, we duplicate to get 3,4,5,5,4,3.\n\nSo the rule is to take each element of the input and duplicate it in the output, maintaining the same order.\n\nTherefore, to apply this rule to the given input in Example 4, we need to take each element of the input grid and duplicate it.\n\nWait, but in Example 4, the input is:\n\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\nSo for each row, the elements are duplicated.\n\nFor example, the first row 1,2,1 becomes 1,2,1,1,2,1.\n\nSecond row 2,8,1 becomes 2,8,1,1,8,2.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the rule is indeed to duplicate each element in the output, maintaining the same order as the input.\n\nTherefore, to solve the problem, I need to take each element in the input grid, and for each element, output it twice in the output grid.\n\nSo, for the given input in Example 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\n\nOutput should be:\n\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\nWhich is six lines, each with six elements, duplicating each input element.\n</think>", -0.25], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid is 3x3:\n\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nAnd the output grid is 6x3:\n\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nHmm, each row in the input seems to be transformed into two rows in the output. That makes sense because the output has twice as many elements as the input.\n\nNow, let's look at a single row from the input and see what happens in the output. Take the first row: 5, 3, 4.\n\nIn the output, we have two rows:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n\nWait, that doesn't seem consistent. Let me check the second row of the output:\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n\nSo, the original row is 5, 3, 4, and the output is 5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5. So maybe each element in the input is being replaced by another element from the same set? Let's see.\n\nThe elements in the input are 5, 3, 4. Looking at the output, the elements are 5, 3, 4, and also 4. So perhaps the rule is to map each element to itself or to another element in the same set.\n\nWait, in the first row of the input, 5 is mapped to 4, 3 is mapped to 4, and 4 is mapped to 5? Or maybe it's a different mapping.\n\nWait, in the second row of the output, the first element is 5, which was the last element in the input. So maybe the rule is to map each element to the element that comes before it in some rotation.\n\nBut let's look at another input row: 3, 4, 5. The output is 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3. So the last element is 3, which is the first element of the input. So perhaps it's a cyclic shift: each element is replaced by the next one in a circular manner.\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis. If the rule is to rotate the elements cyclically, then each element in the input is replaced by the next element in the same set. So for example, if the input has elements 5, 3, 4, then the output for that row would be 3, 4, 5, because each element is shifted right by one position, with the last element wrapping around to the first.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the first row is 5,3,4,4,3,5. Wait, that doesn't fit a simple rotation. Let me check the first output row: 5,3,4,4,3,5. It starts with 5, then 3, then 4, then 4, then 3, then 5. Hmm, that seems like it's repeating 5,3,4, and then 4,3,5. So maybe it's a rotation of three elements?\n\nWait, perhaps it's a combination of two rotations. Let me see: maybe each element is replaced by the element that is three positions ahead in the circular arrangement of the possible values.\n\nLooking at the possible values in the examples, they are mostly 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So the elements are unique and can be considered as a set of numbers from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, for a given element x in the input, the output element is determined by some function of x, perhaps x's position in a circular list.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input is:\n\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nLooking at the first row of the output, it's 5 3 4 4 3 5. So each element is repeated twice. Maybe the rule is to replace each element with itself or with a specific other element.\n\nWait, let's consider the first element in the input: 5. In the output, the corresponding elements are 5,3,4,4,3,5. So the first element is 5 in the input, and in the output, it appears twice. Maybe it's being replaced by 5 again, or perhaps by another number that is related.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace each element x with the element that is x-1, except for 1, which is replaced with 2. Or perhaps it's a different shift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is based on the sum of the elements in each row. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, each row in the input sums to 12 (5+3+4=12, 3+4+5=12, etc.). The output rows sum to 17, 17, etc. Wait, 5+3+4+4+3+5=24. Hmm, that's interesting. So each output row sums to 24, which is twice the input sum (each input row is 12, output rows sum to 24).\n\nWait, but in the output, the first row is 5,3,4,4,3,5, which sums to 5+3+4+4+3+5=24. Similarly, the second row of the output is 3,4,5,5,4,3, which also sums to 3+4+5+5+4+3=24. So it seems that the sum of each output row is twice the sum of the corresponding input row.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily explain the individual elements. Let's see another example.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nSum of the first input row is 7+1+5=13, output row sum is 7+1+5+5+1+7=26, which is twice 13. Similarly, the second input row sums to 7+7+1=15, output row sum is 7+7+1+1+7+7=34, which is twice 15. So the same pattern holds.\n\nSo the rule seems to be that each element in the output row is either the same as the corresponding input element or its complement relative to 9. Because in the first example, 5 is mapped to 4, which is 5-1, but 4 is not 5's complement (which would be 5). Wait, maybe it's not that.\n\nWait, perhaps each element in the output is determined by a formula involving the input element. Let's consider that in the first example, the first row of output is 5,3,4,4,3,5. So the first element is 5, then 3, then 4, then 4, then 3, then 5.\n\nWait, maybe it's a rotation where each element is replaced by the next one in a circular list. For example, if the possible values are 1 to 9, then each element x is replaced by x+1, with 9 wrapping around to 1. But in the output, 5 is mapped to 4, which fits that. 3 is mapped to 4, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the opposite: each element x is replaced by x-1, except 1 which is replaced by 2. So 5 becomes 4, 3 becomes 2, which doesn't match the output. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace each element x with 10 - x. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 1, 5 becomes 5, because 10-5=5. 3 becomes 7, but in the output, the elements are 5,3,4, etc., which don't match that. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a combination of two rotations. Maybe each element is replaced by the element that is three positions ahead in the circular arrangement.\n\nFor example, if the elements are ordered 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, then each element x is replaced by x+3 mod 9, with 9+3=12 mod 9=3. But in the output, 5 is replaced by 4, which doesn't fit 5+3=8 mod 9=8, which is not 4. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different shift. Let's see, in the first output row, 5 is replaced by 4, which is one less than 5. So perhaps each element is replaced by x-1, except when x is 1, which is replaced by 2.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 1. In the first row, 5 becomes 4, 3 becomes 2, 4 becomes 3. But in the output, the first row is 5,3,4,4,3,5. So 5 remains 5, 3 becomes 3, 4 becomes 4, but according to this rule, 4 should become 3. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace each element x with x if it's greater than a certain value, else with x-1. Let's try that.\n\nLooking at the first output row, 5 remains 5, 3 remains 3, 4 remains 4. But according to the rule, 4 should become 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's a different approach. Let me consider the first row of the output as a combination of the input row and a shifted version of it. For example, in the first output row, it's 5,3,4,4,3,5. That looks like the input row [5,3,4] concatenated with [4,3,5]. So perhaps for each row, the output is the input row concatenated with a shifted version of itself.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1. The input row is 5,3,4. The shifted version would be 4,5,3, but the output row is 5,3,4,4,3,5. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's the input row concatenated with a shifted version with a different shift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take each element and replace it with the element that is three positions ahead in the circular list of possible values.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the rule is based on the sum of each row and each column. For example, in Example 1, each row sums to 12, and the output rows sum to 24, which is twice the input sum. But that doesn't explain individual elements.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps each element is replaced by the element that is the sum of the two elements adjacent to it in some way. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of input is 5,3,4. The adjacent elements are 3 and 4, so 3+4=7, but the output element is 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a bitwise operation, like XOR. Let's test that. 5 XOR 3 is 6, which doesn't match 4. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace each element x with x multiplied by a certain factor. Let's see. 5 multiplied by 1 is 5, 3 multiplied by something is 3, 4 multiplied by something is 4. That doesn't explain the output.\n\nWait, maybe it's a combination of two factors. For example, x becomes x if it's even, and x+1 if it's odd. Let's see. In the first output row, 5 is odd, so it becomes 6, which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace each element x with 9 - x. Let's test that. 5 becomes 4, 3 becomes 6, which doesn't match the output. So that's not the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace each element x with (9 - x) + 1. So 5 becomes 5, 3 becomes 7, which also doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different for each row. Let's see if there's a pattern across the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output rows have a certain structure. The first row is 5,3,4,4,3,5. It starts with 5, then 3, then 4, then repeats 4, 3, 5. So it's like the first three elements are the input, and then the last three are the first three in reverse. That seems consistent with the first row of the input.\n\nWait, let's verify this with another input row. Take the second row in Example 1: 3,4,5. The output row would be 3,4,5,4,3,5. So it's the input followed by the reverse of the input. That seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, for the third row in Example 1: 3,4,4. The output would be 3,4,4,4,3,5. Wait, no, because the output for the third row in Example 1 is 3,4,4,4,4,3. Wait, no, in Example 1, the third output row is 3,4,4,4,4,3. So it's the input followed by the reverse of the input. So that fits.\n\nLet me check with another example. Take Example 2:\n\nInput row 1: 7,1,5. Output row: 7,1,5,5,1,7. So 7,1,5 followed by 5,1,7, which is the reverse of the input.\n\nYes, that fits. So the rule seems to be that for each output row, it's the input row concatenated with the reverse of the input row.\n\nSo, to apply this rule, for each row in the input, the corresponding output row is the input row followed by the reverse of the input row.\n\nLet me test this with Example 3:\n\nInput row 1: 2,5,2. Output row: 2,5,2,2,5,2. So yes, it's the input followed by the reverse, which is 2,5,2 again. Wait, no, the reverse of 2,5,2 is 2,5,2. So the output row would be 2,5,2,2,5,2, which matches the example.\n\nSimilarly, for the second row in Example 3: 2,6,4. Output row is 2,6,4,4,6,2, which is the input followed by reverse.\n\nYes, this seems to be the consistent rule.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to Example 4:\n\nInput row 1: 1,2,1. Output row: 1,2,1,1,2,1. Which is the input followed by reverse.\n\nInput row 2: 2,8,1. Output row: 2,8,1,1,8,2.\n\nInput row 3: 8,1,6. Output row: 8,1,6,6,1,8.\n\nYes, that fits.\n\nSo, the rule is that each output row is the input row concatenated with its reverse.\n\nTherefore, to predict the output grid for the given input in Example 4, we need to take each row of the input and append it reversed to form the output rows.\n\nLet me write out the output grid based on this rule.\n\nInput in Example 4:\n\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\n\nOutput rows:\n\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>", -0.25], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Alright, I need to figure out the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let me look at the examples provided to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nHmm, each output line is six numbers. The input is a 3x3 grid, so the output is also 3x3, but each line seems to be arranged in a specific way. Let me break it down.\n\nLooking at the first input line: 5, 3, 4. The corresponding output lines start with 5, then 3, then 4, but the output isn't just repeating the input. Instead, it's arranged in a way that each element is either the same or changes based on some rule.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the sum of the elements in the input row or column. Let me calculate the sums:\n\nInput row 1: 5 + 3 + 4 = 12\nInput row 2: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12\nInput row 3: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11\n\nOutput lines all have six numbers, so probably each line is a combination of sums from adjacent rows or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a permutation of the input, but not just any permutation. It seems that the output lines are made by taking elements from the input grid in a specific order.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the output lines are created by taking the elements in a row-wise manner but in a certain order. For example, in the first example, each output line might be constructed by taking the first element of the first row, then the first element of the second row, then the second element of the first row, and so on, in a specific pattern.\n\nLet me test this idea. For the first input line:\n5, 3, 4\n\nIf I take the first elements: 5, 3, 4\nThen the second elements: 3, 4, 4\nBut the output lines start with 5, then 3, then 4, which matches the first part. Then the next part starts with 3, which is from the second row's first element, then 5 from the second row's second element, then 5 from the third row's first element. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output lines are formed by taking the first element of the first row, then the second element of the first row, then the third element, then the first element, and so on in a snake-like pattern.\n\nBut looking at Example 1, the output lines are arranged in a way that seems to be taking elements from the input grid in a certain order. For instance, the first line of the output starts with 5 (from row 1, column 1), then 3 (row 2, column 1), then 4 (row 1, column 2), 4 (row 3, column 1), then 3 (row 2, column 2), then 5 (row 1, column 3). Wait, that's interesting. So it's taking elements from the first row, then the second row, then the first row again, in a specific order.\n\nSimilarly, the second output line starts with 3 (row 2, column 1), then 4 (row 3, column 1), then 5 (row 2, column 2), 5 (row 3, column 2), then 4 (row 2, column 3), then 3 (row 1, column 3). So it's alternating between taking from the second row and the first row.\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern. So for each output line, the elements are taken in the order of the first row, then the second row, then the first row, then the second row, and so on, but in a way that alternates between the two rows for each element.\n\nBut in Example 1, there are six output lines, each starting with a different element. Let me see:\n\nInput row 1: 5, 3, 4\nInput row 2: 3, 4, 5\nInput row 3: 3, 4, 4\n\nOutput lines:\n\n1. 5, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5\n2. 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3\n3. 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3\n4. 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3\n5. 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3\n6. 5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5\n\nWait, so the first output line starts with row 1, then row 2, then row 1 again. Let's check:\n\nLine 1: 5 (row1, col1), 3 (row2, col1), 4 (row1, col2), 3 (row2, col2), 4 (row1, col3), 5 (row2, col3) \u2192 yes, that's the first line.\n\nLine 2 starts with row2, col1 (3), row3, col1 (3), row2, col2 (4), row3, col2 (4), row2, col3 (5), row3, col3 (4). Wait, but the output line is 3,4,5,5,4,3. So it's 3 (row2, col1), 4 (row2, col2), 5 (row1, col2?), but no, row1 doesn't have a col2. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, in the output lines, each line is six elements, so perhaps it's row1, row2, row1, row2, row1, row2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, it's a specific pattern where each output line is formed by taking elements from the input grid in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps the output lines are formed by taking the elements in a row-wise manner but starting from different rows each time. For example, the first line might be row1, row2, row1, row2, row1, row2, but that would give 6 elements. But looking at Example 1, the first output line is 5,3,4,3,4,5. That doesn't fit row-wise.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the output lines are combinations of the input grid's rows and columns in a specific way. For instance, in the first example, each output line seems to be a combination of the first row, second row, third row, first column, second column, third column in a certain order.\n\nWait, maybe the output lines are constructed by taking elements from the input grid in a specific sequence. For example, in the first output line, it's 5 (row1, col1), 3 (row2, col1), 4 (row1, col2), 3 (row2, col2), 4 (row1, col3), 5 (row2, col3). So it's taking row1, row2, row1, row2, row1, row2 in columns 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3.\n\nSimilarly, the second output line starts with row2, col1 (3), row3, col1 (3), row2, col2 (4), row3, col2 (4), row2, col3 (5), row3, col3 (4). So that would be 3,4,5,5,4,4, but in the example, it's 3,4,5,5,4,3. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the columns are taken in a different order. Let me look at the first output line again: 5,3,4,3,4,5. So it's 5 (row1, col1), 3 (row2, col1), 4 (row1, col2), 3 (row2, col2), 4 (row1, col3), 5 (row2, col3). So columns are 1,1,2,2,3,3.\n\nIn the second output line, it's 3,4,5,5,4,3. That would be row2, col1 (3), row3, col1 (3), row2, col2 (4), row3, col2 (4), row2, col3 (5), row3, col3 (3). Wait, but in the example, the output is 3,4,5,5,4,3. So the last element is 3, which is row3, col3, but row2, col3 is 5, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the columns are being taken in a different order. For example, in the first line, the columns are taken as 1,1,2,2,3,3. In the second line, it's 1,2,1,2,2,3. Let me check:\n\nSecond output line: 3 (row2, col1), 4 (row2, col2), 5 (row1, col1), 5 (row1, col2), 4 (row2, col3), 3 (row3, col3). Wait, that would make it 3,4,5,5,4,3, which matches the example. Oh, I see, so the columns are being taken in the order of row2, row2, row1, row1, row2, row3.\n\nWait, that seems arbitrary, but perhaps it's a pattern. Let me check the third output line:\n\nThird output line: 3,4,4,4,4,3. So it's row2, col1 (3), row2, col2 (4), row3, col1 (4), row3, col2 (4), row2, col3 (4), row3, col3 (3). Wait, but in the example, it's 3,4,4,4,4,3. So the first three are 3,4,4, then row3, col1 is 4, row3, col2 is 4, row2, col3 is 4, then row3, col3 is 3. Wait, but that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the columns are being taken in the order of column1, column2, column3, column1, column2, column3. Let me check:\n\nFirst output line: 5 (row1, col1), 3 (row2, col1), 4 (row1, col2), 4 (row3, col1), 3 (row2, col2), 5 (row1, col3). Wait, but the output is 5,3,4,3,4,5. So it's 5,3,4,3,4,5. So columns are 1,1,2,3,2,3. Hmm, not the same as the input columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are being taken in a specific order, like row2, column1; row3, column1; row2, column2; row3, column2; row2, column3; row3, column3. Let me see:\n\nFirst line: 3 (row2, col1), 3 (row3, col1), 4 (row2, col2), 4 (row3, col2), 5 (row2, col3), 3 (row3, col3). But the output is 5,3,4,3,4,5. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the output lines are constructed by taking the elements in the order of the first row, then the second row, then the third row, but in a specific way. For example, in the first output line, it's row1, col1; row2, col1; row1, col2; row2, col2; row1, col3; row2, col3. That would be 5,3,4,4,3,5, which matches the first line of Example 1.\n\nSimilarly, the second output line would be row2, col1; row3, col1; row2, col2; row3, col2; row2, col3; row3, col3. That would be 3,3,4,4,5,4, but the example shows 3,4,5,5,4,3. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the columns are being taken in a different order. Let me think differently. Perhaps the output lines are formed by taking elements from the input grid in a specific pattern where the order of columns is 1,2,3,1,2,3, etc., but it's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output for a single input line and see how it's formed. For Example 1, the first input line is 5,3,4. The corresponding output lines are six in total, each starting with different elements. Let me see if there's a pattern in how the output lines are formed.\n\nWait, perhaps each output line is a rearrangement of the elements in a specific way. For example, in the first output line, it's 5,3,4,3,4,5. That seems like it's taking the first element of the first row, then the second element of the second row, then the first element of the first row again, then the second element of the second row again, and so on.\n\nWait, let's test that: first line is 5,3,4,3,4,5. So:\n\n- 5 (row1, col1)\n- 3 (row2, col1)\n- 4 (row1, col2)\n- 3 (row2, col2)\n- 4 (row1, col3)\n- 5 (row2, col3)\n\nYes, that matches the first line. The second output line is 3,4,5,5,4,3.\n\nUsing the same pattern:\n\n- 3 (row2, col1)\n- 4 (row3, col1)\n- 5 (row2, col2)\n- 5 (row3, col2)\n- 4 (row2, col3)\n- 3 (row3, col3)\n\nYes, that matches. The third output line is 3,4,4,4,4,3.\n\nUsing the pattern:\n\n- 3 (row2, col1)\n- 4 (row3, col1)\n- 4 (row2, col2)\n- 4 (row3, col2)\n- 4 (row2, col3)\n- 3 (row3, col3)\n\nYes, that's correct. The fourth output line is 3,4,4,4,4,3, same as the third line. The fifth line is 3,4,5,5,4,3, same as the second line. The sixth line is 5,3,4,4,3,5, same as the first line.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: for each output line, take the first element of the first row, then the second element of the second row, then the first element of the first row again, then the second element of the second row again, and so on, alternating between the first and second rows' columns in a back-and-forth manner.\n\nWait, but in the first output line, it's row1, row2, row1, row2, row1, row2. In the second output line, it's row2, row3, row2, row3, row2, row3. And so on.\n\nSo, for each output line, the elements are taken in the order: row1, col1; row2, col1; row1, col2; row2, col2; row1, col3; row2, col3; and repeat this pattern for all six elements.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, let's see if this holds. Example 2's input is:\n\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nAnd the first output line is 7,1,5,5,1,7.\n\nUsing the pattern:\n\n- 7 (row1, col1)\n- 7 (row2, col1)\n- 1 (row1, col2)\n- 7 (row2, col2)\n- 1 (row1, col3)\n- 7 (row2, col3)\n\nYes, that's 7,7,1,7,1,7. Wait, but the output is 7,1,5,5,1,7.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Hmm, so my initial hypothesis might be incorrect.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the first output line is 7,1,5,5,1,7. Let's see:\n\n- 7 (row1, col1)\n- 1 (row2, col1)\n- 5 (row1, col2)\n- 5 (row2, col2)\n- 1 (row1, col3)\n- 7 (row2, col3)\n\nYes, that's 7,1,5,5,1,7. So the pattern is taking elements from row1, col1; row2, col1; row1, col2; row2, col2; row1, col3; row2, col3.\n\nWait, but in that case, the output lines would be:\n\nFirst line: 7,1,5,5,1,7\n\nSecond line: 7,7,1,1,7,7\n\nThird line: 5,3,1,1,3,5\n\nFourth line: 5,3,1,1,3,5\n\nFifth line: 7,7,1,1,7,7\n\nSixth line: 7,1,5,5,1,7\n\nBut in the example, the output lines are:\n\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n\n", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find a common rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid. The user provided four examples, but since I'm just thinking through this, I'll focus on one or two to figure out the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nHmm, each row in the input has three numbers, so each row in the output has six numbers. That makes sense because the output seems to be some transformation of each input row.\n\nLet me look closer. For the first row of the output, it's 5,3,4 repeated. Wait, no, it's 5,3,4,4,3,5. That's like the input row reversed and then reversed again, but not exactly. Wait, the input row is 5,3,4. If I reverse it, it becomes 4,3,5. But the output is 5,3,4,4,3,5. That doesn't seem to match. Maybe it's something else.\n\nWait, perhaps each element in the output is derived from the corresponding element in the input, but in some way. Let me see. For the first element of each output row, it's always 5,3,4, then 4,3,5 for the next rows. Wait, that's not consistent across all rows.\n\nWait, maybe each output element is the sum of the two elements to its left and right in the input row. Let's check. For the first row of the output, 5 is the sum of 5 and 3? No, 5+3 is 8, which is higher. Maybe it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output element is the minimum or maximum of the input row elements. Let's see. For the first output row, the elements are 5,3,4,4,3,5. The minimum is 3, the maximum is 5. So that might fit. But I need to check if this pattern holds across all rows.\n\nLet's take another output row. For example, the second row of the output is 3,4,5,5,4,3. The minimum is 3, the maximum is 5. So it fits. Third row: 3,4,4,4,4,3. Min is 3, max is 4. Wait, that doesn't fit because the output max is 4, but the input max is 5. Hmm, so that theory might not hold.\n\nWait, perhaps each element in the output is the average of the two adjacent elements in the input row. Let's test that. For the first row of the output: 5,3,4,4,3,5. The average of 5 and 3 is 4, which is in the output. The average of 3 and 4 is 3.5, which isn't in the output. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nMaybe it's something to do with the position of the numbers. Let's see. For the first output row, the elements are 5,3,4,4,3,5. The first and last are 5, which are the same as the first element of the input. The second and fifth are 3, which are the second element of the input. The third and fourth are 4, which are the third element of the input. So maybe each output element is a repetition of the input row's elements in a certain pattern.\n\nWait, maybe it's like mirroring the input row. So for the first row, 5,3,4 becomes 5,3,4,4,3,5. That makes sense because it's the input row followed by its reverse. Let me check another row. The second output row is 3,4,5,5,4,3. That's the input row followed by its reverse. Yes, that fits. The third output row is 3,4,4,4,4,3, which is the input row followed by its reverse. Wait, no, the third row is 3,4,4, then 4,4,3. So it's the input row followed by its reverse, but only up to the third element. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, the input row is 3,4,5. The output is 3,4,5,5,4,3. So it's the input row followed by the reverse of the input row. Yes, that fits. Similarly, the fourth output row is 3,4,4,4,4,3. That's the input row followed by its reverse. Wait, but the input row is 3,4,4, so the reverse would be 4,4,3. So the output is 3,4,4,4,4,3. Oh, I see. So that pattern holds.\n\nWait, but let's check the first output row again: 5,3,4 followed by 4,3,5. That's the input row followed by its reverse. Yes, that's consistent. Similarly, the second output row is 3,4,5 followed by 5,4,3. Third row: 3,4,4 followed by 4,4,3. Fourth row: 3,4,4 followed by 4,4,3. Fifth row: same as third. Sixth row: same as second.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row in the input, create a new row by concatenating the original row with its reverse. So each output row is the input row followed by the reverse of that row.\n\nLet me test this with another example. In Example 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nWait, the first output row is 7,1,5 followed by 5,1,7. That's the input row followed by its reverse. Second row: 7,7,1 followed by 1,7,7. That fits. Third row: 5,3,1 followed by 1,3,5. Yes. Fourth row is same as third. Fifth row same as second. Sixth row same as first. So the pattern holds.\n\nAnother example: Example 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\n\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nAgain, each output row is the input row followed by its reverse. For the first row: 2,5,2 followed by 2,5,2. Wait, no, the output is 2,5,2,2,5,2. So it's the input row followed by the reverse of the input row. The input row is 2,5,2, which reversed is 2,5,2. So concatenated, it's 2,5,2,2,5,2.\n\nSimilarly for the second row: 2,6,4 followed by 4,6,2. So output is 2,6,4,4,6,2. Third row: 2,2,2 reversed is 2,2,2. So output is same as input. The fourth and fifth rows are same as third. Sixth row same as second.\n\nSo, the rule is clear now: for each row in the input grid, the output row is the original row concatenated with the reverse of the original row.\n\nSo, to apply this rule to Example 4, let's see:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\n\nOutput should be 1,2,1,1,2,1 followed by 1,2,1. Wait, no, let's see.\n\nWait, the output rows are:\n\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\nSo each output row is the input row followed by the reverse of the input row. Let's verify.\n\nFirst output row: 1,2,1 followed by 1,2,1. So output is 1,2,1,1,2,1.\n\nSecond output row: 2,8,1 followed by 1,8,2. Output is 2,8,1,1,8,2.\n\nThird output row: 8,1,6 followed by 6,1,8. Output is 8,1,6,6,1,8.\n\nFourth is same as third.\n\nFifth is same as second.\n\nSixth is same as first.\n\nYes, so the rule holds.\n\nSo, to solve the problem, I need to take each row of the input and create an output row by appending the reverse of that row.\n\nNow, for the given input in Example 4:\n\nInput:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nEach output row will be the input row followed by its reverse.\n\nFirst output row: 1 6 6 followed by 6 6 1. So output is 1 6 6 6 6 1.\n\nSecond output row: 5 2 2 followed by 2 2 5. Output is 5 2 2 2 2 5.\n\nThird output row: 2 2 2 followed by 2 2 2. So output is 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the output grid should be:\n\n1 6 6 6 6 1\n5 2 2 2 2 5\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Alright, let's try to figure out the rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids. I'll start by carefully examining the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or similarities.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\n\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nSo, the input is a 2x3 grid, and the output is a 3x6 grid. Each row in the input translates into multiple rows in the output. The first row of the output seems to have numbers that are shifted in a particular way. For instance, the first output line is 5,3,4 repeated in some fashion.\n\nLooking at the second row of the output: 3,4,5,5,4,3. Hmm, that seems like the numbers from the second row of the input are being duplicated or rearranged. Let me check the actual input rows.\n\nFirst input row: 5,3,4\nSecond input row: 3,4,5\nThird input row: 3,4,4\n\nSo, each row in the input is transformed into a row in the output, but with some repetition. Maybe the rule involves taking the elements from the input row and placing them in a specific way in the output grid.\n\nAnother observation: The output grid seems to have numbers that are either from the input rows or their combinations. For example, in the first output line, we have 5,3,4, which are all from the first input row. Then, 4,3,5, which are from the second input row. Similarly, the third output line repeats the first input row.\n\nThis suggests that each output row is constructed by taking the elements from the input rows and placing them in a specific pattern. Let's try to see if there's a consistent way to map the input rows to the output rows.\n\nFor example, the first input row is 5,3,4. The first output row is 5,3,4 repeated twice. Wait, no, the first output row is 5,3,4,4,3,5. That doesn't seem to be a direct repetition. Maybe it's a rotation or some other transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output row is formed by taking the elements from the input rows in a specific order. Let's consider the first output row: 5,3,4,4,3,5. It starts with the first element of the first input row, then the second, then the third, then the second, then the first, then the third. That seems like a cyclic permutation of the input row.\n\nSimilarly, the second output row starts with 3,4,5, which are the second row of the input. Then it goes back to 5,3,4, the first row. That would create a pattern where the output rows are a combination of the input rows in a cyclic manner.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with another example. Take Example 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\n\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nLooking at the first output row: 7,1,5,5,1,7. This seems to be a cyclic permutation of the first input row, with the third element duplicated. The second output row is 7,7,1,1,7,7, which is a cyclic permutation of the second input row with the third element duplicated. The third output row is 5,3,1,1,3,5, which is a cyclic permutation of the third input row with the third element duplicated.\n\nThis pattern holds for all the output rows. Each output row is a cyclic permutation of one of the input rows, with the third element appearing twice in the output.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row in the input, create three output rows where the output row is a cyclic shift of the input row, with the third element duplicated.\n\nTo apply this rule to the given test input grid:\n\nTest Input:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nApplying the cyclic permutation with duplication:\n\nFirst output row: Take the first input row and cyclically shift it. So, 1,6,6 becomes 1,6,6. But with the third element duplicated, it becomes 1,6,6,6,1,6.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the output grid should have three output rows. Let me correct that.\n\nEach input row generates three output rows:\n\nFirst input row: 1,6,6\n\n- Output row 1: 1,6,6,6,1,6 (cyclic shift with duplication)\n- Output row 2: 6,6,1,1,6,6 (another cyclic shift)\n- Output row 3: 6,1,6,6,1,6 (third cyclic shift)\n\nSecond input row: 5,2,2\n\n- Output row 1: 5,2,2,2,2,5\n- Output row 2: 2,2,5,5,2,2\n- Output row 3: 2,5,2,2,5,2\n\nThird input row: 2,2,2\n\n- Output row 1: 2,2,2,2,2,2\n- Output row 2: 2,2,2,2,2,2\n- Output row 3: 2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nPutting it all together, the output grid would be:\n\n1 6 6 6 1 6\n6 6 1 1 6 6\n6 1 6 6 1 6\n\n5 2 2 2 2 5\n2 2 5 5 2 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, but in the test input grid, the rows are 1 6 6, then 5 2 2, then 2 2 2. So, each input row produces three output rows, each with six elements. Therefore, the output grid should have 3 input rows \u00d7 3 output rows = 9 rows, each with 6 elements.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the test input:\n\nFirst input row: 1,6,6\n\nOutput rows:\n1,6,6,6,1,6\n6,6,1,1,6,6\n6,1,6,6,1,6\n\nSecond input row:5,2,2\n\nOutput rows:\n5,2,2,2,2,5\n2,2,5,5,2,2\n2,5,2,2,5,2\n\nThird input row:2,2,2\n\nOutput rows:\n2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nSo, the final output grid would be:\n\n1 6 6 6 1 6\n6 6 1 1 6 6\n6 1 6 6 1 6\n5 2 2 2 2 5\n2 2 5 5 2 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully analyzing each example to see if I can spot a pattern or rule.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n5 3 4\n3 4 5\n3 4 4\nOutput:\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 5 5 4 3\n5 3 4 4 3 5\n\nThe input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6-element array. Each row in the output seems to consist of two identical pairs. For example, the first output row is 5 3 4 repeated twice. Similarly, the second output row is 3 4 5 repeated twice. This suggests that each row in the output is a sequence of two elements each repeated three times or something similar. But let me check more examples to see if this holds.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput:\n7 1 5\n7 7 1\n5 3 1\nOutput:\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n5 3 1 1 3 5\n7 7 1 1 7 7\n7 1 5 5 1 7\n\nAgain, the output is a 6-element array. The first row is 7 1 5 repeated twice, the second row is 7 7 1 repeated twice, the third row is 5 3 1 repeated twice, and the fourth and fifth rows are the same as the third. So, it's clear that each row in the output is a row from the input repeated twice.\n\nNow, let's check Example 3:\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n\nHere, the output is also a 6-element array. Each row in the output is a row from the input repeated twice. For example, the first row is 2 5 2 repeated twice, the second row is 2 6 4 repeated twice, and the third row is the third element of the input repeated three times, but wait, the input for Example 3 is:\n\nInput:\n2 5 2\n2 6 4\n2 2 2\n\nSo, the output is:\n2 5 2 2 5 2\n2 6 4 4 6 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nSo, the first and second rows are the first and second rows of the input repeated twice, and the third row is the third element of the input repeated three times? Wait, no, because the input is 3x3, so each row in the output is 3 elements repeated twice, making 6. So, for the third row of the output, it's the third element of the input (which is 2) repeated three times? But the output is 2 2 2 2 2 2, which is 2 repeated six times. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe each output row is made by taking each input row and repeating it twice. So, for the third input row, which is all 2s, the output row would be 2 2 2 2 2 2, which matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, looking at Example 4:\nInput:\n1 2 1\n2 8 1\n8 1 6\nOutput:\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n8 1 6 6 1 8\n2 8 1 1 8 2\n1 2 1 1 2 1\n\nEach row in the output is a row from the input repeated twice. For example, the first output row is 1 2 1 repeated twice, the second is 2 8 1 repeated twice, the third is 8 1 6 repeated twice, and the fourth and fifth rows are the same as the third. The sixth row is 1 2 1 repeated twice.\n\nSo, all the examples show that each row in the output is a row from the input grid repeated twice. That makes sense. So, the rule is: for each row in the output, take the corresponding row from the input and repeat it twice.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid:\n\nTest Input Grid:\n1 6 6\n5 2 2\n2 2 2\n\nWe need to map each row in the output by repeating each row from the input twice.\n\nSo, the first row in the output should be 1 6 6 repeated twice: 1 6 6 1 6 6.\n\nThe second row in the output should be 5 2 2 repeated twice: 5 2 2 5 2 2.\n\nThe third row in the output should be 2 2 2 repeated twice: 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the output grid should be:\n\n1 6 6 1 6 6\n5 2 2 5 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nLet me double-check if this follows the rule across all examples. In Example 1, each row in the output is indeed a row from the input repeated twice. Similarly, in Example 2, the output rows are the input rows repeated twice. So, the rule holds consistently across all provided examples.\n\nTherefore, the rule is clear: each row in the output grid is a repetition of the corresponding row in the input grid, twice.\n</think>", 0.0]]}
