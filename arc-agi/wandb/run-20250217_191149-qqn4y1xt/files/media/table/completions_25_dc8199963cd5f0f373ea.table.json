I'm given two examples, and I need to figure out what the rule is and then apply it to another test input grid. Let me start by carefully examining the examples to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has mostly zeros and a few 6s. The output grid has a lot of zeros and some numbers that are either 4 or 6. The non-zero entries in the output seem to be related to the 6s in the input. Let me try to see if there's a connection between the positions of the numbers and the output.\n\nFirst, I notice that the output grid has a sort of pattern where the numbers are either 0 or 4, except in certain parts. Maybe the rule has to do with the number of times a particular pattern occurs around each cell. Or perhaps it's related to the distance from the nearest 6 or the number of 6s around the cell.\n\nLet me take the first row of the input and see how it maps to the output. The input for the first row is all zeros except for the middle, which has a 6. The output for this row is [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]. Hmm, the middle element is 4. So maybe the 4 is related to the 6 somehow.\n\nLooking at the first row of the output, the middle element is 4. Let's check what happens to the 6 in the input. The 6 is at position (2,1). Maybe the rule involves the number of 6s in a certain neighborhood around each cell.\n\nI'll try to think about how the 6 in the input affects the 4 in the output. If I consider the 6 at (2,1), perhaps it affects the cells around it. Let's look at the cells around (2,1) in the input: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). The output for these cells has 0s, 0, and 4. So maybe the rule is that if a cell is adjacent to a 6, it becomes 4, but if it's not, it remains 0. Wait, but in the output, the middle cell is 4, and the surrounding cells are 0 or 4.\n\nWait, maybe it's not just about adjacency. Let me check another row. Take the second row of the input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output is [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]. So the first and fourth and eighth elements are 4. That suggests that maybe the 4s are placed where there are 2s in the input. Let me see: in the input, the second row has a 2 at position (2,1). So perhaps the 2s are being converted to 4s in the output. But in the other rows, the 2s are not so prominent. Maybe the rule is that wherever there's a 2, it becomes a 4, but only under certain conditions.\n\nWait, looking back at the output, in the second row, the 4s are in positions (1,1), (4,1), and (8,1). So maybe it's about the number of 2s in a certain area. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that if a cell is adjacent to a 6, it becomes 4, and if it's not, it becomes 0. Let me test this hypothesis with the first row. The input has a 6 at (2,1), so according to this rule, the cell (2,1) would become 4, but in the output, it's 4. Wait, but the output's second row is [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], which has 4s in positions 1, 4, and 8. So maybe it's more than just adjacency. Maybe it's about the number of 6s in a 3x3 neighborhood around each cell.\n\nLet me check the cell (2,1) in the input. Its 3x3 neighborhood includes itself and the surrounding cells. In the input, the cells around (2,1) are mostly zeros except for the cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). The cell (2,1) itself is 6, so it's a 6. The cell (1,1) is 0, (1,2) is 0, (1,3) is 0, (2,2) is 0, (2,3) is 0, (3,1) is 0, (3,2) is 0, (3,3) is 0. So that's only one 6 in the neighborhood. But according to the rule, if there are multiple 6s, maybe the cell becomes 4 if there are at least two. But in the output, (2,1) is 4, so that fits. Let's check another cell. For example, (1,2). Let's see what the output is: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, ...]. Hmm, (1,2) is 0 in the input, and in the output, it's 0. So maybe if there are no 6s in the neighborhood, it's 0. If there's one 6, it's 4 if the cell is adjacent to it, or maybe it's 4 regardless.\n\nWait, let me check cell (4,1) in the input. The output is 4. Let's see the neighborhood around (4,1): (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3). The cell (4,1) itself is 0, and the cells around it are zeros except for (4,2) and (4,3), which are zeros. Wait, so there are no 6s in the neighborhood. So according to the rule, it should be 0, but in the output, it's 4. That contradicts my idea that the output is 4 only when there's at least one 6 in the neighborhood. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4 in the output is placed based on the number of 6s in the neighborhood. For example, if there are two or more 6s, the cell in the center becomes 4. That might explain why (2,1) in the output is 4, but not (4,1), which is 0 in the input. Let me check other positions. For example, cell (3,1) in the output is 0. Let's look at its neighborhood: (2,1) is 6, (2,2) is 0, (2,3) is 0, (3,2) is 0, (3,3) is 0. So that's only one 6, so according to the rule, it should be 0, which matches the output.\n\nAnother cell: (1,3) in the input. The output is 0. Let's look at its neighborhood: (1,2) is 0, (1,1) is 0, (1,3) is 6, (2,2) is 0, (2,3) is 0, (3,2) is 0, (3,3) is 0. So only one 6 in the neighborhood, so it should be 0, which matches the output.\n\nWait, but in the second row of the output, the 4s are in (1,1), (4,1), and (8,1). Let's check (1,1). Its neighborhood includes (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), etc. The cell (1,2) is 2, so perhaps the rule is that if any of the surrounding cells have a 2, then the center cell becomes 4. Let me test this. In cell (1,2), the 3x3 neighborhood includes (1,1)=0, (1,3)=0, (2,1)=6, (2,2)=2, etc. Since there's a 2 in the neighborhood, according to this rule, (1,2) would become 4. But in the output, (1,2) is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule isn't based on the number of 2s or 6s in the neighborhood, but something else. Let me think about the 6s in the input. The 6s might be acting as seeds for certain patterns. For example, perhaps in the output, each 6 in the input contributes to the creation of 4s in specific positions around it.\n\nLooking again at the first row of the input, which has a 6 at (2,1). The output for this row is [0,0,0,4,0,0,0]. So the 4 is in the center. Maybe the rule is that any 6 in the input creates a 4 in the same position but only in certain cells. Alternatively, perhaps the 4s are created in the cells that are adjacent to the 6.\n\nWait, in the output, the 4s are in the first, fourth, and eighth positions of the first row. That suggests that in the first row, the 4s are placed in the cells that are two cells away from the 6. Let me see: the 6 is at (2,1), so the cells adjacent to it are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). In the output, the 4 is at (1,1), (1,4), and (1,8). Wait, that doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe it's the number of steps away from the 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are created in the cells that are in the same row as the 6 but one cell away. Wait, in the first row, the 6 is at (2,1), so cells (1,1) and (3,1) are adjacent. The output shows 0s in these positions. Hmm, not matching.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider the entire grid and see if there's a pattern that applies to all cells. Perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output grid is equal to the number of 6s in the corresponding 3x3 neighborhood divided by 2 or something. But looking at the first row, the input has one 6, the output has one 4, but in the first row, the 4 is in the first position. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are placed in the cells that are surrounded by an even number of 6s. Let me test this with the first row. The 6 is at (2,1), so its neighborhood includes (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). None of these are 6 except for the center, which is 0. So no 6s around it. Then, the output is 0, which matches. For the cell (1,1), the neighborhood includes (1,2), which is 0, (2,1), which is 6, (2,2), which is 0, etc. So there's one 6 in the neighborhood, so according to the rule, it should be 4. But in the output, (1,1) is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if any of the surrounding cells are 2, then the center becomes 4. Let's check the first row again. The 6 is at (2,1), so the surrounding cells include (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=0, (2,2)=0, etc. So no 2s, so it's 0, but in the output, it's 0. That matches. Looking at (1,2), the 3x3 neighborhood includes (1,1)=0, (1,3)=0, (2,1)=6, (2,2)=2, etc. So there's a 6 and a 2 in the neighborhood, so the center would be 4. But in the output, (1,2) is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I need to approach this differently. Let me look for a consistent rule that applies across all cells. Maybe the rule is that each cell in the output grid is the minimum of the number of 6s and 2s in its 3x3 neighborhood. But let me test this.\n\nIn the first row, the 6 is at (2,1). The neighborhood includes (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0. So the number of 6s is 1, the number of 2s is 0. The minimum is 0, but in the output, (2,1) is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the output cell is 4 if it is in the same row or column as a 6, and 0 otherwise. Let's check this. In the first row, the 6 is at (2,1). The output for (1,1) is 0, which fits. The output for (3,1) is 0, which fits. For (2,1), the output is 4, which fits. For (2,2), the output is 4, but according to this rule, it should be 0 because (2,2) isn't in the same row or column as the 6. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe the 4s are placed in the same row or column as the 6, but only in certain positions. Let me see. In the first row, the 6 is at (2,1). The output has 4s in (1,1), (1,4), and (1,8). Wait, that doesn't make sense because (1,4) is two cells to the right of the 6 in the same row. Maybe the rule is that the 4s are placed in the cells that are two steps away from the 6 in the same row or column.\n\nBut looking at the second row, the 6 is at (2,1). The output for (2,1) is 4, which aligns with this idea. The 4s are in (1,1), (4,1), and (8,1), which are two steps away from the 6 in the same row. The cell (2,1) itself is 6, so it's not a 4. That seems to fit. So maybe the rule is that in the same row or column as a 6, any cell that is two steps away from the 6 gets a 4, while cells adjacent to the 6 get 0.\n\nWait, but in the first row, the 6 is at (2,1), and the output has 4s in (1,1) and (1,8). That's one step away, not two. So that doesn't fit. Maybe the rule is that in the same row or column, any cell that is in the same row or column as a 6 and is adjacent to it (i.e., one step away) gets a 4, and cells further away get 0. Let me test this with the first row.\n\nIn the first row, (2,1) is the 6. The cells adjacent to it are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). The cells (1,1) and (1,3) are adjacent to the 6 and get 4s. But in the output, (1,1) is 0, which contradicts this rule. So maybe the 4s are placed in the same row and column as the 6 but in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are placed in the cells that are in the same row or column as the 6 but exactly two steps away. Let me check the first row again. If the 6 is at (2,1), then the cells two steps to the left and right are (1,1) and (3,1), which are 0 in the output. That doesn't match.\n\nI'm getting stuck trying to figure out the rule based on the examples. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let me compare the input and output grids row by row and see if I can find a relationship.\n\nLooking at the first input row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 4 is placed in the fourth position. If I consider the 6 in the input as the seed, perhaps the 4 is placed in the cell that is two steps away from the 6 in the same row. Wait, in the first input row, the 6 is at position 6 (assuming 1-based indexing). The output 4 is at position 4, which is two steps to the left. So maybe the rule is that in the same row, the 4 is placed two steps to the left of the 6.\n\nLet me check the second row of input: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0]\nSo the output has 4s at positions 1, 4, and 8. Let's see if they are two steps to the left of the 6 in the second row. The 6 is at position 2. So two steps to the left would be position 0, which doesn't exist. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the 4s are placed in the same column as the 6.

I'll start by carefully examining both examples provided to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a few zeros and some non-zeros, while the output grid has mostly zeros, but certain positions have different values. For instance, the second row in the input becomes [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], and the third row becomes [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0]. This suggests that the rule might involve some kind of averaging or transformation of the input values.\n\nIn Example 2, the input starts with all zeros and then has some non-zeros in specific rows. The output grid seems to increase certain values significantly, especially in the rows where the input has non-zero values. For example, the second row in the output has a 4 in position [2,2], which is higher than the corresponding input value of 0. Similarly, in the third row, position [2,2] becomes 4 as well.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a mix of zeros and twos, and the output shows higher values in some positions. For example, the second row in the output is [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], which is higher than the input's [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This makes me think that the rule might involve multiplying by 2 or some form of scaling.\n\nPutting these observations together, it seems like the rule involves multiplying each input value by 2 and then adjusting it based on the surrounding values or the position in the grid. Alternatively, it could be a combination of scaling and some form of averaging or transformation.\n\nWait a minute, in the output of Example 1, the values are mostly zero, but some are non-zero. The non-zero values seem to be influenced by the input's non-zero values, perhaps through some kind of averaging or edge effects.\n\nAnother angle to consider is that the output grid seems to have a structure where certain rows or columns are identical or follow a specific pattern based on the input. For example, in the output of Example 1, the first row is all zeros, the second row has non-zero values in positions [1,1] and [1,3], and so on.\n\nThis suggests that the rule might involve some kind of convolution or filter applied to the input grid. For instance, maybe the output is generated by applying a 3x3 filter to the input, where each cell in the output is computed based on a weighted sum of the surrounding cells in the input.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could involve looking at the maximum or minimum values in certain regions of the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the output's non-zero values seem to be related to the highest non-zero value in the corresponding positions of the input grid.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule involves expanding or modifying the grid based on certain rules. For instance, in Example 1, the last row of the input has all non-zero values except the last cell, and the output has similar patterns.\n\nConsidering all these possibilities, I think the rule involves some form of edge effect or convolution where each output cell is computed based on a combination of the surrounding input cells. Specifically, perhaps each output cell is derived from the maximum or minimum value of a certain window in the input grid, adjusted by some factor.\n\nGiven that the output in Example 1 has non-zero values at positions that are closer to the edges of the input grid, it's likely that the rule involves taking the maximum or minimum value of a certain window and applying a scaling factor based on the position. For example, cells closer to the edges might be multiplied by 2, while those in the center might remain the same or be adjusted by another factor.\n\nLooking at the second row of Example 1, the output is [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]. The first and fourth cells are 4, which seems to be twice the input values of 2. The third cell is 0, which is unchanged. This pattern suggests that the rule might involve multiplying the input value by 2, but only in certain positions where the output is non-zero.\n\nSimilarly, in the third row of Example 1, the output starts with 0, then 4, followed by 0, and so on. This again aligns with the idea that certain cells are scaled up by a factor of 2, while others remain unchanged.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule likely involves taking each input cell and multiplying it by 2, then ensuring that the output values are within certain bounds or follow a specific pattern. However, in the output grid, some cells remain 0 even though the input had non-zero values, indicating that the rule might also involve conditions where the output cell is only non-zero if the corresponding input cell meets certain criteria.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could involve a more complex transformation, such as applying a mask or filter across the input grid, where each output cell is a weighted sum of the input cells in a specific neighborhood. This would explain why the output grid has a structured pattern with non-zero values in specific positions.\n\nIn summary, after analyzing the examples and considering various possibilities, the most likely rule is that each output cell is determined by a combination of the input values and some scaling factor, possibly based on the position in the grid or the surrounding cells. The exact transformation might involve multiplying by 2 or applying a filter with specific weights, but the key idea is that the output grid is generated by a rule that transforms the input grid in a systematic way.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or similarities.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has mostly zeros and a few 6s. The output grid has zeros and some non-zero values, specifically 4, 8, and 8 in certain parts. Hmm, maybe the rule involves counting something.\n\nIn Example 2, the input starts with a lot of zeros, then a single 7 in the middle. The output is a grid where some cells have a 4 and others have 7s. It seems like the 7s in the input are being transformed into 4s in certain positions, but I'm not sure exactly how.\n\nExample 3 shows an output grid where certain cells have 4s and others remain as per the input. It looks like the rule isn't just a simple count of something.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule involves the number of 3s in the input grid. Let me check. In Example 3, the input has 0s and 2s, but the output has 4s and 3s. Maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the count of how many times a certain number appears in the corresponding row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the number of non-zero elements in each row or column. But in Example 1, the output has a 4, which might not directly correspond to the number of non-zero elements.\n\nAnother approach is to look at specific cells and see if there's a pattern. For instance, the first cell (0,0) in the output is 0, which is the same as in the input. The cell (0,1) in output is 4, but in input it's 2. Maybe it's adding something, but 2 to 4 doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule involves the sum of the row and column indices. Let me try that. For cell (i,j), the output might be the sum of i and j. But in Example 1, the middle cells are 6, and the output has 4s, which don't align with simple sums.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product of i and j. For cell (i,j), output is i*j. But in Example 1, the 6s would transform into 2, 3, etc., which doesn't match the output.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rule is based on the number of times a certain value appears in the row or column. For example, in Example 2, the input has a single 7, and the output has some 4s. Maybe the rule is to add 4s where a certain condition is met, like the presence of a 7.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the number of times a 3 appears in the corresponding row or column of the input grid. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and a single 6. The output has 4s in certain positions. If I look at the cell (0,1), which is 0 in input, and 4 in output, that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is derived from the input by some transformation involving the inverse of the grid or applying a mathematical function to each cell.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the sum of the input cell and the cell to its right, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves the number of times a 3 appears in each row or column and then applying a transformation based on that count.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has 3s in certain cells, and the output has 3s in other cells. Maybe the rule is to keep certain cells as is and transform others based on some condition.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to look for a pattern across all examples. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 6s in the fourth row. The output has 4s in the fourth row, second and third columns. Maybe the rule is to replace a 6 with a 4 in certain positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a single 7, and the output has 4s in certain positions. Perhaps the rule is to replace a 7 with a 4, but only in specific cells.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s in the first few rows, and the output has 3s in some positions. It's possible that the rule is to keep the 3s as they are and transform others.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the average of the input cell and its right neighbor. Let me test this.\n\nFor cell (i,j), output = (input[i][j] + input[i][j+1]) / 2. But in Example 1, the cell (3,1) is 6, and in output it's 4. Let's calculate: (6 + 6)/2 = 6, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the number of times a certain value appears in the row. For example, if a row has a 6, it might turn into a 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace each 6 with a 4, but only in specific positions. Let's look at Example 1:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (all zeros except the fourth row: 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0)\n\nOutput row: 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the fourth row, which originally had four zeros, became 4 in the second column and zero elsewhere. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to look at the number of times a certain value appears in the row and then set a cell to that count. But in Example 1, the 6s turn into 0s and 4s, which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the rule involves the number of 3s in each row. Let me check the examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a lot of 3s in the first few rows, and the output has 3s in some of those rows. It's possible that the rule is to replace certain cells with 3s based on the number of 3s in the row.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace each cell with the number of 3s in its row plus the number of 3s in its column. Let me see.\n\nTake the first cell in Example 1: input is 0. Rows with 3s are the third row (input 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) and the fourth row (0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0). So rows with 3s: 2 rows. Columns with 3s: only the third column (input 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0). So cell (0,0) would be 2 (rows) + 0 (columns) = 2, but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of 3s in the row or column minus some value.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rule is that each cell is the sum of the input cell and the cell to its left or right. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to invert the grid, but that seems too simple and doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace each cell with the count of 3s in the corresponding row or column, but that would require checking each cell.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 3, which has a lot of 3s in the first few rows. The output also has 3s in those rows, but some other cells have 3s as well. Maybe the rule is that certain cells remain 3s, while others are transformed based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is based on the inverse of the grid, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the rule involves the number of times a certain pattern appears in the row or column. For example, the pattern could be defined as a 3 followed by a 3, and the count of such patterns determines the output.\n\nBut I'm not sure. I'm going to consider that the rule might involve the count of a certain value in the rows and columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the sum of the input cell and the cell below it, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the maximum of the input cell and the cell to the right.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the number of times a 3 appears in the corresponding row or column of the input grid.\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row has two 6s, so the count of 3s in that row is zero. But the output has a 4 in the second and third columns. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the inverse of the grid. For example, each cell becomes 3 minus the input cell. But in Example 1, the 6 becomes -3, which doesn't fit the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the sum of the input cell and the cell above it. Let's test this.\n\nFor cell (i,j), output = input[i][j] + input[i-1][j]. But in Example 1, the cell (3,0) is 0, and perhaps the cell above it is zero, so 0+0=0, which fits. Similarly, cell (3,1) is 0, and the cell above is 0, so 0+0=0, but the output is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the sum of the input cell and the cell to the right, but in Example 1, the cell (3,1) is 0, and the cell to the right is 6. 0+6=6, but the output is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace each cell with the number of times a 3 appears in its row or column plus some offset. But in Example 1, the 6s turn into 4s, which suggests a linear transformation.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is 4 minus the input cell, but in Example 1, 6 becomes -2, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves the inverse of the cell value, but that's speculative.\n\nI'm going to try to look for a different pattern. Maybe the rule is that each cell is the result of some function applied to the input cell and its neighbors. For example, perhaps it's based on the sum or difference of adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the number of times a 3 appears in its row plus the number of times a 3 appears in its column, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the number of 3s in the corresponding row plus the number of 3s in the corresponding column. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a lot of 3s in the first few rows. The output has 3s in those rows, which aligns with the idea that the row count is 1 for the first row, 2 for the second, etc. So maybe the rule is to count the number of 3s in each row and column.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), output[i][j] is equal to the number of 3s in row i plus the number of 3s in column j.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1.\n\nInput row 3: 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0. There are no 3s, so the row count is 0.\n\nOutput row 3: 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. So cell (3,1) is 0, which would correspond to the row count (0) plus column count (1). But output is 0, so 0=0+1? That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, that suggests the rule is not correct.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is the number of non-zero elements in the row or column, not the number of 3s. Let me try that.\n\nIn Example 1, row 3 has two 6s, so non-zero elements are 2. But the output is 4 in cell (3,1). That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is the number of times a certain value appears in the row or column, multiplied by some factor.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the cell (3,1) is 0 in input, and 4 in output. If I assume that the rule is to count something, perhaps the number of 3s in the row and column is being added.\n\nBut in row 3, there are no 3s, so 0+0=0. Output is 4, so that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the rule is to take the maximum between the row and column count of 3s and add some value.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the sum of the number of 3s in its row and the number of 3s in its column, plus some constant.\n\nBut in Example 1, row 3 has no 3s, so 0 + 0 =0. Output is 4, so maybe plus 4. But 0+4=4, which fits cell (3,1). Let's check another cell.\n\nCell (3,2) in output is 0. The row count is 0, column count is 1 (since column 2 has 0s except for row 3), so 0+1=1. But output is 0, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this doesn't seem to work.\n\nMaybe the rule is more complex, involving the inverse of the cell value or some other transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the result of adding the value of the cell to the left and the cell above. Let me test this.\n\nFor cell (i,j), output = input[i][j] + input[i-1][j] + input[i][j-1]. But in Example 1, cell (0,1) is 0, and cell (1,1) is 0, but cell (0,0) is 0. So 0+0+0=0, which fits. Cell (0,2) is 0, same as above. But cell (3,1) is 0. The cell above is input (2,1) which is 0, and the cell to the left is input (3,0) which is 0. So 0+0+0=0, which matches the output 0. That seems promising.\n\nLet me test this with another example. Take Example 2.\n\nInput row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. All zeros, so output is all zeros.\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. All zeros, so output is all zeros.\n\nInput row 2: 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7. Let's look at cell (2,1). Input is 0, cell above is 0, cell to the left is input (2,0) which is 0. So output is 0+0+0=0. But according to Example 2, the output row 3 is 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7 7. So cell (2,1) in output is 4. But according to this rule, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, so the rule might not be simply the sum of the cell and its left and top neighbors.\n\nMaybe it's a different combination or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell above, but if the cell is on the edge, it just uses the available neighbor.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1.\n\nIn cell (0,1), which is 0, the cell above is invalid (i=0, so left neighbor is 0), so output is 0+0+0=0. Which matches.\n\nIn cell (3,1), the cell above is input (2,1)=0, and the cell to the left is 0, so output is 0+0+0=0. But according to Example 1, output is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is more complex, involving some other transformation or function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the sum of the input cell and the cell to the right. Let's see.\n\nFor cell (i,j), output = input[i][j] + input[i][j+1]. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nCell (3,0): input is 0, right neighbor is 0, so 0+0=0. Output is 0. Correct.\n\nCell (3,1): input is 0, right neighbor is 6, so 0+6=6. Output is 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the cell and its right neighbor, but multiplied by some factor. For example, output = (input[i][j] + input[i][j+1]) * k. But in Example 1, cell (3,1) would be 6 * k, which needs to be 4. So k would be 4/6=2/3, but then other cells might not fit.\n\nPerhaps not.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rule involves the inverse of the cell value, like 1/(1+input). Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, cell (3,1) is 0, so 1/(1+0)=1, but output is 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 2^(input cell). But in Example 1, 2^6=64, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the maximum of the input cell and the cell to the right, multiplied by a factor. For example, output = max(input[i][j], input[i][j+", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me take a look at the examples provided to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has a bunch of zeros and a few 6s. The output grid has mostly zeros, but some 4s and 6s in specific positions. Hmm, maybe the 6s are being converted to 4s in certain places. I notice that the 6s are in the second, fourth, and sixth columns of the fifth row and the fifth column in the second row of the second half of the grid. \n\nWait, let me check that again. In the fifth row, the input has 6s in the second and fourth columns, and in the fifth column? No, the fifth row is 0 6 6 0 6 6 0, so the 6s are in columns 2, 3, 5. The output for that row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0. So the 6s in columns 2 and 3 of the input are converted to 4s in the output, but the one in column 5 remains 0. That suggests that only certain 6s are converted, probably based on their position.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a lot of 0s and a 7 in the fifth and seventh rows. The output for those rows has 4s and 7s in specific places. It looks like when a 7 is in a certain column, it's converted to a 4, and 0s elsewhere. For instance, in the fifth row of the second half, the 7s are in columns 4 and 6, and they're converted to 4s in the output, but other positions remain 0.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output for the fifth row (with 7s) shows 0s in columns 3, 5, and 7, but the 4s are in columns 4 and 6. So maybe it's about how many 7s are around each cell. Or perhaps it's based on the number of 7s adjacent to a cell in the input grid.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s and 0s, and the output has 3s and more 4s. It seems like 3s stay as 3s, and some 0s turn into 4s based on their neighborhood. Maybe it's about counting certain patterns around each cell.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems like the rule involves looking at the surrounding cells (like neighbors) and determining how many 6s or 7s are present in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 6s might be converted to 4s when they have a certain number of 6s in their neighboring cells. Similarly, in Example 2, 7s might be converted to 4s based on their neighboring cells.\n\nI think the rule is that each cell in the output grid is determined by counting the number of 6s or 7s (depending on the example) in a specific pattern of the corresponding neighborhood in the input grid. If the count is greater than a certain number, the cell becomes a 4; otherwise, it remains 0. Alternatively, it could be a different threshold or condition.\n\nTo be more precise, I should look at how the 6s and 7s are being converted. In Example 1, the 6s in positions like (5,2), (5,3), and (5,5) are being converted to 4s in the output, but other 6s remain 0. Maybe it's based on the number of 6s in certain columns or rows. \n\nWait, in Example 1, the fifth row has 6s in columns 2, 3, and 5. The output's fifth row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0, so the 6s in columns 2 and 3 are converted to 4s, but the one in column 5 remains 0. Maybe it's about the sum of certain columns or rows. Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of 6s in even-numbered columns or something like that.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the positions of the non-zero elements in the output and see where they are in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's non-zero elements are in positions (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), etc. Wait, no, in the output, the non-zero elements are in the first column of the fifth row, the fourth column of the second row, and so on. Maybe it's a specific kind of pattern, like a cross or diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the sum of the digits in each row or column. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has three 6s, and the output has a 4 in the fourth column. Maybe 3 times 6 is 18, and 18 divided by something gives 4, but that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, let me think differently. In the output grid, a lot of cells remain 0, only certain positions have 4s or 6s. Maybe the rule is that each cell is the average of its neighboring cells, rounded down or something. For example, if a cell has four 6s around it, its output would be 6. But in the output, some cells are 4, which suggests that maybe it's the nearest lower integer based on the count.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rule is that if a cell has at least three 6s in its neighborhood, it becomes 4, otherwise 0. That might explain why in Example 1, the fifth row's second and third columns become 4s, but the fifth column remains 0. Wait, no, in the output, the fifth column of the fifth row is 0, but in the input, the fifth column has 6s in the second and third rows. Maybe it's based on the number of 6s in each cell's neighborhood.\n\nBut I'm not sure. It might be better to try to find a pattern based on the differences between the input and output grids. For example, in the fifth row of Example 1, the input has 0 6 6 0 6 6 0, and the output is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0. So the 6s in columns 2, 3, and 5 are converted to 0s, except the fourth column which becomes 4. That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, in the output, the fourth column has 4, so perhaps it's the sum of certain cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of 6s in specific cells. For instance, if a cell has a 6 and in its row and column, there are certain 6s, maybe it gets converted to 4.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to find a consistent rule across multiple examples. Let's look at Example 2. The input has a 7 in the fifth, sixth, and seventh rows. The output for those rows has 4s in the fourth, fifth, and sixth columns, but the 7s remain as 4s in some places. Wait, no, the output shows 4s in those columns for the 7s. So maybe whenever a cell has a 7, it's converted to 4, unless it's in a specific position.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 6s are converted to 4s in certain positions, not all of them. So it's not a direct 7 to 4 conversion.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rule is about the number of 7s adjacent to a cell. For example, if a cell has at least one 7 in its Moore neighborhood, it becomes 4. That might explain why in Example 2, the 7s are converted to 4s. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 2, the fifth row of the input has 7s in columns 4, 5, and 6. In the output, these columns have 4s, and other columns remain 0. So this fits with the idea that if a cell has at least one 7 in its neighborhood, it becomes 4.\n\nWait, but in the output, the 7s themselves remain 4. So perhaps the rule is that each cell becomes 4 if it has a 7 in its neighborhood, and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The fifth row of the input has 6s in columns 2, 3, and 5. In the output, the fourth column (which is adjacent to the 6s) becomes 4, while other columns remain 0. This fits the rule that if a cell has a 7 in its neighborhood, it becomes 4. So maybe this rule applies to all examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s and 0s. The output has 3s and 4s. For example, the first row of the output is all 3s, which suggests that cells with 3 do not change, but cells with 0 might change to 4 if they are in certain positions. Wait, no, in the output, the first row has 3s in positions where the input has 3s. So maybe 0s turn into 4s under certain conditions.\n\nWait, let's see. In the output, the first row has all 3s, which are the same as the input. So maybe 0s in certain positions become 4s. For example, in the fifth row of the input, the output has 0s in columns 3, 5, and 7, but 4s elsewhere. So perhaps when a 0 is surrounded by certain 0s or 3s, it becomes 4.\n\nWait, but in the first row of the input, all are 3s. The output is the same. So maybe the rule is that if a cell has a 3 in the input, it remains 3, and 0s turn into 4s based on their neighbors.\n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be:\n\n- For each cell, if it contains a 7, it becomes a 4 in the output, unless it's in a specific position where it remains 7. Wait, but in Example 2, the 7s remain as 7s in the output. So maybe only 7s that are in certain positions are converted to 4s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell becomes 4 if it contains a 7 in its neighborhood, and 0 if it contains a 6 in its neighborhood. But in Example 1, the 6s are converted to 4s in certain positions, not all.\n\nWait, maybe it's a combination. For example, if a cell has a 7 in its neighborhood, it becomes 4, and if it has a 6, it becomes 0. That would fit Example 2, where 7s are converted to 4s, and 6s remain 0. In Example 1, 6s are converted to 4s in certain positions, perhaps based on their position relative to other cells.\n\nSo, the rule could be:\n\n- If a cell has a 7 in any of its neighboring cells (Moore neighborhood), it becomes a 4.\n- If a cell has a 6 in any of its neighboring cells, it becomes a 0.\n- If a cell doesn't have a 7 or 6 in its neighborhood, it remains the same.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The fifth row of the input has 6s in columns 2, 3, and 5. According to the rule, these 6s would become 0s, but in the output, the fifth row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0. So the 6s in columns 2, 3, and 5 are converted to 0s, which fits. The 6 in column 5 is converted to 0, but the 6 in column 2 and 3 remain 0. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe the 6s remain 6s unless they are in a specific position.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 6s are converted to 4s in certain positions but remain 6s elsewhere. For example, the 6 in column 2 of the fifth row becomes 4, but the 6 in column 3 and 5 remains 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit the rule I thought of.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the output's fifth row has 0s in columns 2 and 3 but 4 in column 5. Wait, no, in the output, it's 0 0 0 4 0 0 0. So the 6 in column 2 becomes 0, the 6 in column 3 becomes 0, and the 6 in column 5 becomes 4. That suggests that 6s become 0s unless they are in a certain column where they become 4.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the 7s remain as 7s. So maybe the rule is that if a cell has a 7, it becomes a 4, unless it's in a specific column where it remains 7. For example, in Example 2, the 7s in the fifth, sixth, and seventh rows are in the fourth, fifth, and sixth columns, and they remain 7s. But in the fifth row of Example 1, the 6s in columns 2, 3, and 5 become 0s, but the 6 in column 5 becomes 4. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to find a consistent rule based on the differences between the input and output grids. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 6 in certain positions and the output has 4s in those positions. Maybe it's about the sum of the cells in each row or column.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the sum of its neighboring cells divided by a certain number. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's fourth column has 4, which might be the sum of its neighbors divided by something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the number of 6s or 7s in a specific pattern around each cell. For example, if a cell has a 7 and in its Moore neighborhood, there are three or more 7s, it becomes 4. Otherwise, it remains 0.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the 7s in the fifth, sixth, and seventh rows have their neighborhoods containing two or more 7s, so they become 4s. The 7s themselves remain 7s, so that fits. In Example 1, the 6s in certain positions have neighbors with more 6s, so they become 4s. But this is speculative.\n\nI think I need to find a rule that, when applied to the input, produces the output. Let's try to see if there's a pattern based on the positions of the non-zero cells.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 4s in positions that correspond to the input's 7s. For example, the 7s in the fifth, sixth, and seventh rows are in columns 4, 5, and 6. The output's 4s are in columns 4, 5, and 6, which matches. So maybe whenever there's a 7 in the input, the corresponding cell in the output is 4.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 6s in certain columns. The output has 4s in those columns, but not in others. So perhaps for 6s, the corresponding cell in the output is 4 only if it's in a specific column or row pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the fifth row's fourth column (which is where the 4 in the output comes from) has a 6 in the fourth column of the input. So maybe when a cell in the input has a 6, the corresponding output cell is 4 if it's in the fourth column of the fifth row and similar positions in other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is determined by the number of 6s in its neighborhood. If there are at least three 6s, the cell becomes 4; otherwise, it remains 0.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. In the fifth row, the fourth column has a 6. Its neighborhood includes cells around it, so if it has at least three 6s, it becomes 4. That fits the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the 7s in the fifth, sixth, and seventh rows have their neighborhoods containing two or more 7s, so they become 4s. The 7s themselves remain 7s, which fits.\n\nIn Example 3, looking at the first row of the output, all are 3s, which are the same as the input. So maybe 0s in certain positions become 4s. For example, in the fifth row of the first row, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which matches the input. But in the sixth row, it's 0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7, so the 4 is in the third position. Maybe cells with 0 in certain positions become 4s under specific conditions.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps I should look for a consistent rule by comparing the input and output grids.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider the number of surrounding cells. For example, maybe cells in the edges or corners have fewer neighbors, so the rule applies differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell becomes 4 if it has a 7 in any of its Moore neighbors, and 0 if it has a 6. If a cell doesn't have a 7 or 6 in its neighbors, it remains the same. That would explain Example 2, where 7s remain 7s, and 6s become 0s. In Example 1, 6s become 4s in certain positions.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output's fifth row's fourth column has a 4, which would correspond to a 6 in the fifth row's fourth column. So perhaps when a 6 has a 7 in any of its neighbors, it becomes 4. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nBut in Example 1, the fifth row's fourth column is a 6, and it has a 7 in the fifth column, so it becomes 4. Similarly, the 6s in columns 2 and 3 have 7s in columns 5 and 6, respectively, so they become 4s in the", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's start by carefully analyzing the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has 0s and a couple of 6s. The output grid has 0s and some 4s and 6s. I notice that the 6s in the input are being replaced by 4s in the output. But wait, not all 6s are turned into 4s. For instance, in the third row of the input, there are 6s in columns 2 and 3, but they remain 6 in the output. Similarly, some 6s in the fourth and fifth rows are also kept. So maybe the 6s aren't uniformly converted; perhaps the rule depends on their positions.\n\nLet me look at another example. In Example 2, the input has 0s and some 7s. The output grid has 4s where the 7s were. Specifically, the cells with 7s are being converted to 4s. But again, not all 7s are converted; only those in certain positions. For example, in the fifth row of the input, all cells are 7s except for the first and last, which are 0s, and these 0s are turned into 4s in the output. Wait, in the output, the first and last cells of the fifth row are 0, while the middle cells are 4s. That doesn't fit with the initial thought that 7s are being converted to 4s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule isn't as straightforward as just replacing 6s with 4s or 7s with 4s. Let's consider the third example to see if there's a different pattern. In Example 3, the input has 3s and 0s, and the output has 3s and some 4s. The output seems to have more 4s in certain regions, but it's not obvious yet.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look for a pattern based on the sum of the rows or columns. In Example 1, the input has a few 6s. If I add up the numbers in each row and column, perhaps that can help. Let's take a closer look.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row is all 0s, so the sum is 0. The second row is also all 0s. The third row has 0s except for the third and fourth positions, which are 0 and 0. The fourth row has 0s except for the first, third, and fifth positions, which are 0, 0, and 0. The fifth row has 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Adding these up gives 2 + 2 = 4. Wait, but the output for the fifth row is 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the sum of the fifth row in the output is 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8. That doesn't match the sum of the input, so that's probably not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves the number of 0s in a row or column. Let's test that. In the fifth row of Example 1, there are two 0s. The output for that row is 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, which has three 0s. That doesn't fit. Maybe the opposite: the number of non-zero elements. The fifth row in the input has two 0s and two 2s, so four non-zero elements. The output has 8 non-zero elements. Again, that doesn't fit directly.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the positions of the non-zero numbers. In Example 1, the non-zero numbers are 2s in the fifth row and 6s in the seventh, eighth, and ninth rows. The output grid has some 4s in the fifth, seventh, and eighth rows. Maybe the non-zero numbers are being reduced by 2 or something. For example, 6 becomes 4, but 2 becomes 4 as well? That doesn't make sense because 2 would need to be transformed into 4, which is an increase.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule involves the sum of the numbers in the row or column. Let's calculate the sum of the fifth row in Example 1: 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4. The output for that row is 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, which sums to 8. That's exactly double the input sum. Maybe the rule is that each non-zero element is replaced by the sum of its row divided by 2 or something. But let's check other rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7. The output for this row is 0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0. The sum of the input row is 7*6=42, and the output row sums to 0+0+4+4+4+4+4+4+0=28. Hmm, that's not half. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that each 7 is replaced by 4, but that doesn't fit all cases.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rule is that certain cells are being incremented or decremented based on their neighboring cells. For example, if a cell has a 6, it becomes 4 in the output. But in the fourth row, the input has 6s in positions 2 and 3, but the output shows 4s in those positions. Similarly, in the fifth row, the 0s are converted to 4s. So maybe any 6 becomes a 4, but 0s are converted to 4s as well? Wait, no, because in the sixth row of Example 1, there are 6s in the second and third positions, which are converted to 4s, but the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth positions are 0s, which in the output remain as 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a value greater than 2 is reduced to 4, while 0s remain 0. Let's test that. In the fifth row, there is a 2, which is not greater than 2, so it remains 2. But in the output, the fifth row has 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The first and fourth cells are 4, which suggests that the 2s are being converted to 4s. Similarly, in the seventh row of Example 1, the cells with 7 are converted to 4s, which fits. In the sixth row, the 6s are converted to 4s. So the rule could be: any cell with a value greater than 2 is replaced by 4, while 0s and 2s remain the same. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row has 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0. According to the rule, the 2s become 4s, so the output should have 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, which matches. Similarly, the seventh row has 7s, which become 4s. The sixth row has 6s, which become 4s. The fourth and fifth rows have 2s, which remain 2s. The first and fourth rows have 0s, which remain 0s. The output for these rows matches the rule.\n\nLet's check Example 2 to see if this rule holds. In Example 2, the fifth row has 7s. According to the rule, 7 becomes 4, which matches the output. The sixth row has 7s, which become 4s. The seventh row has 7s, which become 4s. The eighth row has 0s, which remain 0s. The output for these rows matches the rule.\n\nIn Example 3, the fifth row has 0s, which remain 0s. The sixth and seventh rows have 0s, which remain 0s. The first and last rows have 3s, which remain 3s. The second and third rows have 0s, which remain 0s. The fourth and fifth rows have 0s, which remain 0s. The sixth and seventh rows have 0s, which remain 0s. The eighth row has 0s, which remain 0s. The ninth and tenth rows have 0s, which remain 0s. The output matches the rule that non-zero cells remain the same, and zeros remain zeros.\n\nSo, based on these observations, the rule is: any cell with a value greater than 2 is replaced by 4, while 0s and 2s remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Example 3, let's see the input and output:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule: any cell with a value greater than 2 is replaced by 4. In the input grid, the sixth row has a 7, which becomes 4 in the output, as seen. Similarly, in the seventh row, all 0s remain 0s, but the sixth and seventh rows have 0s as well. The eighth and ninth rows have 7s, which become 4s. The tenth row has a 7, which becomes 4, and the rest have 0s. The sixth and seventh rows in the fifth column have 7s, which become 4s in the output.\n\nThis confirms that the rule holds for all examples. Therefore, the rule is to replace any cell with a value greater than 2 with 4, while leaving 0s and 2s unchanged.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the examples provided, it seems that each cell in the output depends on some pattern in the corresponding cells of the input. Since the output grids have non-zero values, maybe the rule has something to do with the number or presence of non-zero values in the input cells.\n\nLet me take the first example and look at the input and output grids. The input is a 9x9 grid with mostly zeros and some non-zeros. The output also has zeros and some non-zeros, which suggests that the rule isn't completely trivial.\n\nIn the first example, the output grid has a 4 in the first row, fourth position, and other non-zero values. The input there has 6s and 0s. I notice that in the input, the 6 is in the second row, fourth column, which seems to influence the output. Maybe the rule involves counting or summing certain values in the input.\n\nLooking deeper, the second row in the output is [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4]. The input has 6s in the second row and fourth column. It seems that each 6 in the input might contribute to multiple outputs, but how exactly?\n\nPerhaps the rule is about how many times a particular value appears in the row or column. For example, if a row has multiple 6s, maybe each 6 contributes to a 4 in the output. But I need to check this.\n\nLooking at the third example, which is a bit simpler. The input has 3s and 0s, and the output has 3s and 0s except for some positions. The rule here seems to involve only 0s and 3s, which suggests that the rule doesn't involve 6s or other higher numbers.\n\nWait, in the second example, the input has 7s in certain positions, and the output has 4s and 7s. This indicates that the rule might involve some kind of averaging or transformation of the input values, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me focus on the first example again. The input has 6s in the second row, fourth column, and also in the fifth and sixth rows. The output shows non-zero values in certain positions. Maybe the rule is that for each non-zero output value, it corresponds to a certain number of non-zero input values in a specific pattern.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is equal to the number of non-zero input values in its row multiplied by a certain factor. For example, if a row has three non-zero values, each output cell in that row could be set to the same value based on the sum of the inputs.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output has 4s and 6s transformed into other values. Maybe it's a case of each cell in the output being the sum of certain input cells divided by another factor. For instance, if each output cell is the average of its neighboring cells or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves the number of times a particular value appears in a window of cells. For example, in a 3x3 window, if there are multiple 6s, each 6 contributes to a 4 in the center cell of the output.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the center cell is 4, which might correspond to having multiple 6s in its row or column. Maybe the rule is that each output cell is the sum of all the non-zero values in its row divided by the number of non-zero values in the row.\n\nIn the first example, the second row has three 6s. If I sum them, it's 18, and if I divide by three, I get 6, but the output in the fourth column is 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's multiplied by a certain factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is the sum of its adjacent cells divided by the number of adjacent cells. For example, in a 3x3 grid around a cell, if there are multiple 6s, the output is the average.\n\nLooking at the output, the center cell of the first output row is 4. If I consider the input row in the first example, the second row has 6s in the fourth position. Maybe the rule is that each 6 in the input contributes to a 4 in the output, but only in specific positions.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the positions where the output is non-zero. In the first example, the output non-zero positions are:\n\n- Row 1: columns 3, 6, 9 (but the output is only non-zero for the first row, which suggests it's 0s except for column 3)\nWait, actually, looking back, the output for the first example is:\n\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nSo, the non-zero values are in positions:\n\n- (1,4)\n- (2,1), (2,4), (2,7)\n- (3,2), (3,4), (3,6)\n- (4,3), (4,6)\n- (5,1), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8)\n- (6,3), (6,4), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nThis suggests that each non-zero cell in the output corresponds to a certain number of non-zero cells in the input, but I'm not sure how exactly.\n\nIn the second example, the output is:\n\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nSo, the non-zero values in the output are in the first few rows, with some patterns. Maybe it's a combination of rows and columns where certain cells are influenced by multiple input non-zero cells.\n\nPutting it all together, it's challenging to find a single rule that fits all examples. Perhaps the rule involves the number of non-zero cells in each row and column, or some other transformation based on the input structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each output cell is the sum of all the non-zero input cells in its row divided by the number of non-zero cells in its row. For example, if a row has multiple 6s, the output would be the sum divided by the count.\n\nIn the first example, the second row has three 6s. If I sum them, it's 18, and dividing by three gives 6, but the output in that row is 4. That doesn't fit. Maybe it's multiplied by a factor. If I multiply by 1/3, it's 6, but the output is 4, so that's not matching.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rule involves the number of non-zero cells in each row and column, and each output cell is determined by some function of both. For example, the output might depend on the sum of the non-zero cells in the row and the sum in the column.\n\nLooking at the third example again, which is a bit simpler. The input has 3s and 0s, and the output has 3s and 0s except for some positions. The rule here seems to involve only 0s and 3s, so maybe the rule isn't about 6s.\n\nWait, in the third example, the output has 4s in certain positions, but the input has 3s. So perhaps the rule involves averaging or some other operation.\n\nMaybe each output cell is the average of its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) in the input. For example, if a cell has a 6 in the input, the output cell would be 2, but in the first example, the output has 4s and 6s transformed into other values, so maybe it's not exactly averaging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cells are determined by the number of times a particular value appears in a certain pattern of the input. For example, in the first example, each 6 in the input contributes to multiple outputs.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the transformation of individual cells. For example, the cell at (1,4) in the first output is 4, which might correspond to the sum of certain input cells, maybe those in a specific pattern around it.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think the rule is that each output cell is equal to the sum of all the non-zero input cells in its row. So, for each row, if there are non-zero cells, their sum is divided by the number of non-zero cells to get the corresponding output. \n\nFor example, in the first example, the second row has three 6s. The sum is 18, and if we divide by three, it's 6, but the output in that row is 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's multiplied instead of divided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the average of the non-zero cells in the row. But in the first example, the output row has a 4 in position 4, which might correspond to having three 6s. If I take the average, it's 6, but the output is 4. So maybe it's not the average.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output cell is the sum of the non-zero cells in its row divided by the number of non-zero cells in the row, but only if the sum is greater than a certain threshold. For example, if the sum is 6 and there are three non-zero cells, the average is 2, but in the output, it's 4, so perhaps it's doubled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is the sum of all non-zero cells in its row multiplied by a certain factor, like 2. So 6 * 2 = 12, but the output is 4. That doesn't fit either.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe each output cell is determined by the number of non-zero cells in its row and column. For example, if a row has four non-zero cells, the output cell might be 4.\n\nLooking at the first example, the second row has three 6s, so maybe each output cell in that row is 4. That might make sense. Then, the fifth row has five 6s in certain positions, so perhaps each output cell is 4 as well. The sixth row has six 6s, so each output cell is 4.\n\nIn the second example, the output has cells with 4s and 7s, which might correspond to different rules based on the input patterns.\n\nGiven all this, I think the rule is that each output cell is equal to the number of non-zero cells in the corresponding row of the input. So, for example, if a row has four non-zero cells, each output cell in that row is 4. This seems to fit the first example, where the second and fifth rows have three and five non-zero cells respectively, but the output cells are all 4, which suggests that it's the row index that determines the output.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output is 0 for the first row, 4 for the second row, and so on. So maybe the output grid has a single 4 in each row, regardless of the number of non-zero cells. That would mean that the rule is simply that each row in the output has a single 4, unless the row index is a multiple of a certain number.\n\nBut looking at the first example's output, the first row has a single 4, the second row has three 4s, and the third row has three 4s. That doesn't fit a single rule.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that each output cell is equal to the sum of all non-zero cells in its row plus a certain value. For example, if the sum is 6 and there are three non-zero cells, the average is 2, but in the output, it's 4, so maybe it's multiplied by 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each output cell is the sum of all non-zero cells in its row divided by the number of non-zero cells, multiplied by a certain factor. For example, if the sum is 6 and there are three non-zero cells, the average is 2, multiplied by 2 gives 4, which matches the output.\n\nThis seems plausible. So, the rule is: for each row in the input, calculate the sum of all non-zero cells. Then, for each cell in the output, set it to the average of the non-zero cells in its row, multiplied by a factor of 2.\n\nLet me test this with the first example. The second row has three 6s, sum is 18. Divided by three, average is 6, multiplied by 2 is 12. But the output cell is 4, so that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe the factor is different.\n\nWait, in the first example, the output has 4s in certain positions. So maybe the factor is not applied to the entire row but per cell, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is equal to the number of non-zero cells in its row. So, if a row has four non-zero cells, each output cell is 4. This would fit the first example, where the second row has three non-zero cells, but the output cell is 4. Similarly, the fifth row has five non-zero cells, but the output cell is 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell is the number of non-zero cells in its row divided by the number of columns in that row. For example, if a row has four non-zero cells, each output cell is 4 (since there are four columns in the row). But in the first example, the output has 4s in certain positions, which might correspond to rows with multiple non-zero cells.\n\nThis is getting a bit too speculative. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at the third example, the input has 3s and 0s, and the output has 3s and 0s except for some positions. It seems that the rule involves only 0s and 3s, so maybe the rule is related to the number of non-zero cells in a specific pattern, like a diagonal or a 2x2 square.\n\nIn the third example's input, the non-zero cells are in the first and last rows and the first and last columns. The output has 3s in the first row and first column, and 3s in the last row and last column, except for some positions. So perhaps the rule is that each output cell is 3 if it's on the edge of the input grid, and 0 otherwise.\n\nWait, but in the output of the third example, the last row has 0s except for some cells. So maybe it's not that straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each output cell is equal to the sum of the input cells in its row and column. For example, if a cell has multiple non-zero neighbors in its row and column, the output is the sum.\n\nBut in the first example, the output has 4s in certain positions, which might correspond to cells with multiple non-zero neighbors.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is derived from the input by replacing zero cells with the number of non-zero cells in their row, and keeping the existing non-zero cells. For example, if a row has four non-zero cells, all output cells in that row would be 4.\n\nTesting this with the first example, the second row has three non-zero cells, so all output cells in that row would be 4, which matches the second row of the output. Similarly, the fifth row has five non-zero cells, so all output cells would be 4. This seems to fit the first example.\n\nLet me check the second example. In the input, the first row has eight non-zero cells, so all output cells would be 8. Looking at the output, the first row has 4 0s followed by 4 0s, which doesn't match 8. So maybe this rule isn't completely correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is equal to the number of non-zero cells in its row divided by the number of columns in that row. For example, if a row has four non-zero cells and four columns, each output cell would be 1. But in the first example, the output cells are 4, which would require the row to have four non-zero cells and four columns, but in the input, the rows have varying numbers of non-zero cells.\n\nWait, in the first example, the rows have 0, 3, 3, and 8 non-zero cells. So if the rule is to set each output cell to the number of non-zero cells in its row divided by the number of columns in its row, then the output would have 0, 0, 0, 4, etc., but in the actual output, the cells are 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern. Perhaps the output grid is a transformation of the input grid where each cell is incremented by a certain value based on its row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each output cell is equal to the sum of the input cells in its row and column, plus a certain value. For example, if a cell has a sum of 6, the output is 4, which is 6 minus 2.\n\nBut in the first example, the second row has three 6s, sum is 18, minus 2 is 16, which doesn't match the output.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output cell is equal to the number of non-zero cells in the row multiplied by a certain factor. For example, 3 non-zero cells in the row would result in an output cell of 4, so the factor is approximately 1.333.\n\nBut in the first example, the second row has three non-zero cells, and the output cell is 4, which would fit if the factor is 4/3. Similarly, the fifth row has five non-zero cells, and the output cell is 4, which would", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully looking at the examples provided to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at Example 1, I see that the input grid has a lot of zeros and a few non-zero values. For instance, in the 5th row, there's a 6, and in the 6th and 7th rows, there are multiple 6s. The output grid seems to have non-zero values in specific positions. My first thought is that the rule might involve some kind of averaging or diffusion across the grid.\n\nLet me take a closer look at the input and output. In the input, the non-zero values are either 0s or 6s, and in the output, they are also 0s, 4s, and 6s. So, it's clear that the rule is altering the values in a non-trivial way.\n\nI think the rule here might involve some kind of edge effect or the influence of neighboring cells. For example, maybe each cell's value is updated based on the average of its neighbors or some combination of them. But since the output has values like 4 and 6, it's not just an average; it's more complex.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule is based on the number of adjacent cells with certain values. For instance, if a cell has exactly two neighbors with a value of 6, it might be set to 4. But looking at the output, it's not just about the count but how those values are distributed.\n\nLet me try to analyze a specific part of the grid. Take the 5th row of the input, which is [0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0]. In the output, this row becomes [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0]. Hmm, so the original 6s are being reduced to 4s, but they're not all being converted. It seems like it's a mix of different cells being affected.\n\nI notice that in the output, the 6s are being replaced by 4s or 0s, but not all. It's possible that the rule involves a combination of the number of 6s and 0s in the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has too many 0s around it, it might turn into a 4, but if it's too surrounded by 6s, it might turn back into 0.\n\nAnother angle is to consider how the non-zero values propagate. In the output, the 4s and 6s seem to be concentrated in specific regions, which might indicate that the rule is local, affecting only certain parts of the grid without changing the entire structure.\n\nLet me think about the third example to see if the rule is consistent. In Example 3, the input has 3s and 0s, and the output has 3s and 0s except for certain cells. The rule seems to be consistent across all examples, so I can focus on understanding the transformation from input to output.\n\nConsidering the first example, the input has a 5th row with two 6s, and the output has three 4s and a 6 that's preserved. It looks like the 6s are being converted into 4s, but one remains. Maybe the rule is that each 6 in a row is converted to a 4, except for the last one which is preserved.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a row of 7s, and the output has 0s in the first and last positions but 4s in the middle. This suggests that the rule affects all non-zero cells in a way that they are replaced by 4s, except for certain edges.\n\nPutting this together, I think the rule is that each non-zero cell is converted to a 4, except for certain edge cases where it remains a non-zero value like 6 or 7. The exact conditions under which a cell is converted or remains non-zero need to be determined.\n\nTo confirm this, I'll apply the rule to another part of Example 1. The 6th row of the input is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output is the same. That fits the rule since these cells are all 0s. The 7th row, which has multiple 6s, in the output becomes [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So each 6 is converted to a 4, and the last cell remains 0.\n\nApplying this to Example 2, the input row [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7] in the 10th row of the output becomes [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]. So the 7s are converted to 4s. The same pattern holds for other non-zero cells.\n\nTherefore, the rule seems to be that each non-zero cell in the input grid is converted to a 4, with the exception of cells that are on the edge and have fewer than four neighbors. In such cases, the cell remains the same. For example, in the first row, all cells have fewer than four neighbors, so they remain 0. In the last row, the cells on the edges have fewer than four neighbors, so they remain 0 as well.\n\nSo, to implement this rule, I need to:\n\n1. For each cell in the grid, check if it's non-zero.\n2. If it's non-zero, convert it to 4.\n3. If it's on the edge (i.e., has fewer than four neighbors), leave it unchanged.\n4. If it's in the middle, convert it to 4.\n\nThis should cover all the cases seen in the examples.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid provided:\n\nThe input is a 10x9 grid with mostly zeros, some 2s, and a couple of 6s and 7s in specific rows.\n\nLet me go through each row and apply the rule:\n\n1. First row: All cells have fewer than four neighbors (since it's the first row), so they remain 0.\n2. Second row: Similarly, only some cells have fewer than four neighbors, but in this case, the 2s might be in positions where they have enough neighbors. Let me check the specific cells.\n3. Third row: The same logic applies. Only cells with enough neighbors are converted to 4.\n4. Fourth row: Same as above.\n5. Fifth row: Contains a 6. Since it's in the middle, it will be converted to 4.\n6. Sixth row: Contains a 0, so it remains 0.\n7. Seventh row: Contains multiple 6s, which will be converted to 4s.\n8. Eighth row: Same as seventh.\n9. Ninth row: Contains multiple 6s, which will be converted to 4s.\n10. Tenth row: Contains 7s, which will be converted to 4s.\n\nBy applying this rule, I can construct the corresponding output grid.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has some zeros and a few 6s. The output grid has 4s and 6s. It looks like the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions. Maybe the rule has to do with the number of 6s in a row or column?\n\nLet me examine the positions where a 6 changes to a 4. In the first row of the output, the second and third elements are 4s, but the others are zeros. That doesn't immediately tell me a pattern. Maybe it's related to the surrounding values.\n\nLooking at the input grid, I notice that the 6s are placed in specific places. For instance, in the second row of the input, there's a 6 in the first and second columns. The output shows 4s in the second and third positions of the corresponding row. Hmm, maybe when a 6 is next to another 6, it becomes a 4? Or perhaps when there are multiple 6s in a row, they are converted to 4s.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the 6s are being averaged with neighboring values. For example, if a 6 is surrounded by two 4s, the average would be 4. That might explain why the 6s become 4s. But I need to check if this holds true across other rows and columns.\n\nLet's look at another example. In Example 2, the input grid has a 7 in certain positions, and the output shows 4s and 7s. The positions where 7s are present in the input seem to become 4s in the output. Maybe the rule is that any 7 in the input is converted to a 4, but only if certain conditions are met, like being adjacent to another 7 or something like that.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has a 7 in the center, and the output has 4s around it. Maybe when a 7 is the only non-zero in its row or column, it's converted to 4. That could explain why in the last row, the output has 7s and 4s as well.\n\nLet me try to generalize this. It seems that the rule involves converting certain non-zero values in the input grid to zeros and others to specific numbers based on their position. For instance, in Example 1, the 6s are being converted to 4s. Maybe the rule is that if a cell contains a 6, it becomes a 4 if it has at least one neighboring cell with a 6. That might make sense.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 3, the 0s are being converted to 4s, but not all. It depends on the surrounding values. Perhaps when a 0 is next to a 4, it becomes a 4, but if it's next to a 6, it becomes a 0. That could explain the pattern.\n\nPutting this together, the common rule seems to be: for each cell, if it contains a 6, it becomes a 4 if at least one of its adjacent cells (top, bottom, left, right) also contains a 6. Otherwise, the cell remains unchanged. Additionally, perhaps zeros are converted to 4s if they are adjacent to a 4, otherwise, they stay as 0.\n\nLet me test this rule with the examples. In Example 1, the input has 6s, and the output converts them to 4s where they have neighboring 6s, which aligns with the rule. In Example 2, the 7s are converted to 4s, which fits the rule where 7s become 4s. In Example 3, zeros become 4s when adjacent to 4s, which works.\n\nSo, the rule is that each cell is converted to 4 if it is a 6 and has at least one adjacent 6, or if it is a 0 and has at least one adjacent 4. Otherwise, the cell remains 0 or 6.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the user's test input. Let me go through each row and apply the rule step by step.\n\nThe user's input is:\n\n0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nI'll apply the rule to each cell:\n\n- For the first row: All zeros are converted to zeros, except where 6s are. Since there are no 6s, they stay as 0.\n\n- Second row: First and second cells are 2, which are converted to 4 if adjacent to 6, but since they are not 6s, perhaps they remain 2. Wait, no, the rule says if it's a 0 and adjacent to a 4, it becomes 4. But in this row, the first cell is 2, which is not 0 or 4. So, it remains 2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule. Let me clarify: Each cell is converted to 4 if it is a 6 and has a 6 neighbor, or a 0 and has a 4 neighbor. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.\n\nSo, in the second row:\n\n- First cell: 2. No 4 neighbors, so remains 2.\n\n- Second cell: 2. No 4 neighbors, remains 2.\n\n- Third cell: 0. If adjacent to 4, becomes 4. But in this case, the third cell is 0 and adjacent to 2 (second cell) and 2 (fourth cell). No 4s, so remains 0.\n\nSimilarly, the rest of the cells in the second row remain as 2, 0, etc.\n\nThird row: All 0s, so remain 0.\n\nFourth row: Same as third.\n\nFifth row: Same as fourth.\n\nSixth row: Same as fifth.\n\nSeventh row: Same as sixth.\n\nEighth row: Same as seventh.\n\nNinth row: Same as eighth.\n\nTenth row: All 0s, remain 0.\n\nNow, looking at the output, from Example 1, the output's first row is all zeros, which matches our analysis.\n\nSecond row in the user's input is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. Applying the rule, the 2s remain as 2 since they're not 0 or 4 and have no 4 neighbors.\n\nThird row remains 0.\n\nFourth row remains 0.\n\nFifth row remains 0.\n\nSixth row remains 0.\n\nSeventh row remains 0.\n\nEighth row remains 0.\n\nNinth row remains 0.\n\nTenth row remains 0.\n\nSo, the output should be:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWhich matches the output from Example 1.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's look at the examples provided to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nLooking at the input and output, it seems like numbers are being replaced based on some rule. Let me focus on the positions where the number changes.\n\nIn the first row of the input (all zeros), the second, fourth, and sixth elements become 4. Wait, but the output's second and sixth rows have 4s in different positions. Hmm, perhaps it's not uniform.\n\nLet me consider the input row by row and see what's happening. For example, the fifth row of the input is 0,6,6,0,6,6,0, and the corresponding output is 0,6,6,4,6,6,0. So, the two 6s in the middle become 4 in the third position. Maybe it's related to some averaging or counting.\n\nLooking at the sixth row of the input, 0,6,6,6,6,6,0, becomes 0,6,4,4,4,6,0. So, the four 6s become 4s in the second, third, and fourth positions. This suggests that perhaps each 6 in a row is contributing to the positions it affects.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of 6s in a row or column. Let me check another example.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nHere, the third row's 7s become 4s in the second, fourth, fifth, and seventh. The fourth row's 7 becomes 4 in the second and fourth. This seems inconsistent, so maybe the previous example was more useful.\n\nLooking back at Example 1, let's focus on the fifth row of the input: 0,6,6,0,6,6,0. The output is 0,6,6,4,6,6,0. So, the two 6s in the middle are replaced by a 4 in the third position. That suggests that a 4 is added for each 6 in the row.\n\nWait, but in the sixth row of the input, 0,6,6,6,6,6,0 becomes 0,6,4,4,4,6,0. So, the four 6s become 4s in positions 2,3,4. That's three 4s. So, maybe it's not a direct count but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the number of 6s in the row or column. But in a row, the fifth row has two 6s; the sixth has four 6s. But in the output, the number of 4s is more than the count of 6s. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of 6s. For example, in the fifth row of the input, there are two 6s, and in the output, the third position is 4. So, perhaps each 6 contributes to a 4 in the middle. But in the sixth row, there are four 6s, and the output has four 4s in the middle positions, which might align.\n\nBut then, what about the fourth row of the input, which has a single 7. The output's middle positions have 4s, which might not align. So, maybe it's not directly the count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about the number of 6s in a row or column. Let's count the number of 6s in the fifth row of the input: 0,6,6,0,6,6,0 \u2192 four 6s. In the output, the third row's middle has a 4. But in the output of the fifth row, the third position is 4. Wait, the fifth row of the output is 0,6,6,4,6,6,0. So, the third position is 4, but the count of 6s is four. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the sum of the 6s. For example, the fifth row of the input has four 6s, and the output at position 3 is 4, which could be the sum. But in the sixth row, the output at positions 2,3,4 are 4s, which is three, but the input has four 6s. So, maybe it's not the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the number of 6s in a row, and for each 6, a 4 is added in the middle. But in the fifth row, four 6s would result in four 4s, but the output only has one 4 in the third position. That doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe it's about the number of 6s in a column. Let's check. In Example 1, the first input row has all 0s, so the first column is all 0s. The second row has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The third row has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Wait, no, the input in Example 1 has the first column as all 0s. So, perhaps the rule is to add a 4 in the middle of the row if there are 6s.\n\nWait, let's try that. In the fifth row of the input, there are two 6s. So, adding a 4 in the middle would result in 0,6,6,4,6,6,0, which matches the output. Similarly, in the sixth row, there are four 6s, so adding a 4 in each of those positions would result in 0,6,4,4,4,6,0. That matches.\n\nBut then, what about the fourth row of the input, which has a single 7. If there's a 7, maybe it's replaced by a 4? But in the output, the middle positions have 4s, but the 7s are in the fourth row. So, perhaps when there's a 7, it's replaced by a 4 in the middle.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the fourth row's 7 becomes a 4 in the middle positions, which aligns with this idea. So, perhaps the rule is: for each row, if there is a 6, replace the middle position with a 4. If there is a 7, replace the middle positions with 4s. For other numbers, they stay the same.\n\nBut wait, in the sixth row of Example 1, there are four 6s, so replacing the middle three positions with 4s would give 0,6,4,4,4,6,0, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the fourth row has a 7, which in the output becomes 4 in the middle, which fits the rule.\n\nIn Example 3, let's check. The third row of the input has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So, no 6s or 7s, so the output remains the same, which makes sense.\n\nAnother example: the fifth row of Example 1, which has two 6s. So, the middle position becomes 4. The sixth row with four 6s: middle positions become 4. The fourth row with one 7: middle positions become 4. The fifth row in Example 2 has a 7, which becomes 4 in the middle.\n\nSo, is the rule: for each row, look for any 6s or 7s. If there's a 6, replace the middle position with 4. If there's a 7, replace the middle positions with 4s. Otherwise, leave the row as is.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row has two 6s. The middle position is the third. So, it becomes 4. In the sixth row, four 6s, so the middle three positions become 4. That fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the fourth row has a single 7, so the middle positions become 4. That matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the third row has no 6s or 7s, so it remains the same.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row is all 0s, so no change. Similarly, the second row is all 0s.\n\nSo, this seems consistent. So, the rule is: for each row, count the number of 6s and 7s. If there's at least one 6, replace the middle position with 4. If there's at least one 7, replace the middle positions (three in this case) with 4s.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the sixth row has four 6s. The output shows 0,6,4,4,4,6,0. So, three 4s in the middle. That's consistent.\n\nAnother test: the fourth row of Example 1 has a 7 in the middle. So, the middle position becomes 4. The output shows 0,0,0,0,6,0,0. Wait, no, the fourth row of the input is 0,6,6,0,6,6,0, and the output is 0,0,0,4,0,0,0. So, the middle position is 4, which fits.\n\nWait, but no, the fourth row of the input is 0,6,6,0,6,6,0. The output is 0,0,0,4,0,0,0. So, only the middle position is 4, not the positions around. So, it seems that only the middle position is replaced, not the surrounding ones.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row, identify the middle position. If there's a 6, replace the middle position with 4. If there's a 7, replace all the middle positions with 4s. Otherwise, leave the row as is.\n\nWait, but in the sixth row of Example 1, which has four 6s, the middle three positions are replaced with 4s. So, the positions 2,3,4 become 4s.\n\nIn the fourth row of Example 1, which has a 7, only the middle position is replaced with 4.\n\nIn the fifth row of Example 1, two 6s, so middle position is 4.\n\nSo, this seems consistent.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Example 2:\n\nInput row with single 7: output row with middle position as 4.\n\nInput row with two 7s: replace the middle positions with 4.\n\nInput row with three 7s: replace the middle positions with 4.\n\nSo, the rule holds.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput row with six 0s: output same.\n\nInput row with all 0s except one 6: middle position becomes 4.\n\nInput row with one 7: middle position becomes 4.\n\nSo, the rule works.\n\nThus, the rule is: for each row, identify the middle position. Replace the middle position with 4 if there's a 6 or a 7 in the row.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the fifth row has two 6s, and the output has only one 4. So, perhaps only one 4 is added. Similarly, in the sixth row, four 6s lead to four 4s in the middle.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row, count the number of 6s and 7s. For each occurrence, replace the middle position with 4.\n\nBut in the examples, each occurrence of 6 or 7 leads to a single 4 in the middle. Is that correct?\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row has two 6s, so two 4s would be needed, but the output only has one 4. So, perhaps it's that each 6 or 7 in the row contributes a 4 to the middle positions.\n\nWait, maybe it's that for each 6, a 4 is added in the middle, and for each 7, a 4 is added in all the middle positions.\n\nBut in Example 1, the fifth row has two 6s, so two 4s would be added, but the output only has one 4. So, perhaps it's that each 6 contributes one 4, and each 7 contributes one 4 in the middle.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the fourth row has a single 7, so the middle position becomes 4, which is correct.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row has two 6s, so the middle position would be 4, but the output shows only one 4. Hmm, maybe it's that each 6 or 7 in the row contributes one 4 in the middle.\n\nWait, but in the fifth row, the output has one 4 in the middle, but the input has two 6s. So, perhaps it's that each 6 or 7 in the row contributes one 4.\n\nSo, the rule would be: for each row, if there's a 6 or a 7, each occurrence adds a 4 in the middle position, and if there's a 6, it only adds one 4.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the fourth row has a single 7, which adds a single 4. In Example 1, the fifth row has two 6s, so the middle position is 4, but only one 4 is added.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: for each row, if there's at least one 6, add one 4 in the middle position. If there's a 7, add one 4 in the middle position.\n\nBut in Example 1, the fifth row has two 6s, so two 4s would be added, but the output shows only one 4. So, maybe it's that each 6 or 7 adds one 4 in the middle, but only once per occurrence.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row, look for 6s and 7s. For each occurrence, add a 4 in the middle position.\n\nBut in Example 1, the fifth row has two 6s, but the output only has one 4. So, perhaps it's that each 6 adds a 4, and each 7 adds a 4, but only in the middle position.\n\nWait, perhaps it's that for each 6 or 7, a 4 is added in the middle position, and each 6 can only contribute one 4.\n\nSo, in Example 1, the fifth row has two 6s, so the middle position would be 4, but the output shows only one 4. So, maybe it's that each 6 adds a 4, but each 7 can only contribute one 4.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row, count the number of 6s and 7s. For each 6, add a 4 in the middle. For each 7, add a 4 in the middle, but only once per occurrence.\n\nIn Example 1, two 6s, so two 4s added. But the output shows only one 4 in the middle. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each row, if there's a 6, add a 4 in the middle, and if there's a 7, add a 4 in the middle, but only once per 6 or 7.\n\nSo, the fifth row would have two 4s added, but the output shows only one. So, perhaps the rule is that each 6 or 7 can only contribute one 4 to the middle position.\n\nWait, perhaps it's that for each row, if there's a 6, it contributes a 4 in the middle, and if there's a 7, it also contributes a 4 in the middle, but the middle position can only be updated once per 6 or 7.\n\nIn Example 1, two 6s, so two 4s would be added. But the output shows only one 4 in the middle. So, perhaps it's that each 6 or 7 can only contribute one 4.\n\nSo, the fifth row has two 6s, but only one 4 is added. So, it's not consistent with the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are three examples provided, so I'll start by analyzing each one to see if I can spot any patterns or rules that apply.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and some 6s. The output seems to be a mix of zeros and other numbers, but it's not immediately clear how the 6s and 0s are related to the output numbers. Maybe the rule has to do with the number of certain patterns or the sum of specific elements.\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid has a couple of 7s, and the output grid has 4s and 7s in specific positions. I notice that the 4s appear in places where there were 7s in the input. Perhaps the rule involves converting 7s to 4s based on some condition, maybe their position or a specific count.\n\nExample 3 is interesting. The input has mostly 3s and a few zeros except for some 2s in the middle. The output has 4s in some places and zeros elsewhere. It seems like the 2s are being converted to 4s, but only in certain positions. Maybe it's about replacing 2s with 4s when they are in specific rows or columns.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the rule involves a few key steps: identifying certain patterns or positions in the input that get converted to specific values in the output. For example, perhaps the 2s in the middle are being incremented to 4s, and the 6s are being reduced to 4s based on some condition.\n\nI should try to formalize this. Let's think about each example in detail.\n\nIn Example 1, the output grid has zeros where the input has zeros, but with some 4s in certain positions. It seems like the 4s are being placed where there were 6s in the input, but only in specific rows and columns. Maybe it's related to the count of 6s in a particular area or their positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the 4s are replacing some 7s in the input, possibly based on their location. For instance, a 4 might be placed where a 7 is located, but only in specific cells. This could involve checking the row, column, or some other property of the 7s to determine if a 4 is added.\n\nIn Example 3, the 4s are replacing 2s in the middle of the grid. This suggests that there's a rule where a 2 becomes a 4 under certain conditions, maybe when it's in a specific row or column.\n\nI think the common rule across all three examples is that certain values in the input are being replaced or transformed into different values. Specifically, it looks like the rule involves replacing 2s with 4s, 6s with 4s, and 7s with 4s, but only in specific positions. The exact positions depend on the row and column of the input grid.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, 6s turn into 4s, and in Example 2, 7s turn into 4s. Also, in Example 3, 2s turn into 4s. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value in the input that is greater than 1 is being converted to 4. But let me check the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 6s, which become 4s in the output. The 0s stay 0s. In Example 2, the input has 7s, which become 4s. In Example 3, the input has 2s, which become 4s.\n\nBut there's also zeros in the input, and they stay zeros. So perhaps the rule is: for each cell, if the value is greater than 1 and not zero, it's replaced with 4; otherwise, it remains the same.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 6s, which are greater than 1, so they should become 4. However, in the output, some 6s are turned into 4s, but not all. Specifically, the 6s in the first few rows are replaced with 4s, but the last few are not. Maybe the rule is more specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about the number of non-zero elements or their positions, but that seems less likely.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3, the 2s turn into 4s, but only in the middle rows. Maybe it's based on the row or column position.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the positions where the values change. For example, in Example 1, the 6s in the input become 4s in certain cells, but not all. The output shows that the 6s in the first three rows become 4s in the first three columns, but the last three rows of the first three columns are zero. So perhaps the rule is that any 6 in the first three rows becomes a 4 in the same column, but in the last three rows of the first three columns, they remain zero because they were zeros in the input.\n\nWait, in the output of Example 1, the first three rows have 4s in the first three columns, but the last three rows have zeros in those columns. So maybe the rule is that if the input has a 6 in the first three rows, it becomes a 4 in the same column, but in the last three rows, regardless of the column, it becomes zero.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let me check if this holds with Example 2 and 3.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 7s in the second and fifth rows (counting from the top). The output has 4s in some of these rows, but not all. For instance, in the second row, the output has a 4, but in the fifth row, it doesn't. This suggests that the rule might involve the number of 7s or their positions.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the input has 2s in the middle rows, and the output has 4s in those rows, but not in the first and last rows.\n\nSo, putting this together, the rule seems to be: for each cell in the input grid, if the value is greater than 1, it is replaced by 4. Otherwise, it remains the same. However, there's an exception for the first and last rows, where zeros are preserved, regardless of the input values.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has 4s in the first three rows of the first three columns, but the last three rows of those columns are zeros. This suggests that for the first three rows, if the input cell is greater than 1, it becomes 4, but if it's in the first three columns, it remains zero. Similarly, in the last three rows, regardless of the column, if the input cell is greater than 1, it becomes 4, but zeros remain zero.\n\nThis adds another layer to the rule: the transformation depends on the row. For the first three rows, any non-zero value (greater than 1) becomes 4, but in the first three columns, it remains zero. In the last three rows, any non-zero value becomes 4, regardless of the column.\n\nThis seems to explain the examples. Let's verify:\n\nIn Example 1, the first three rows have 6s in the first three columns. According to the rule, since it's the first three rows, any non-zero value becomes 4, but in the first three columns, it remains zero. So the 6s become 4s in the first three columns of the first three rows. The last three rows of the first three columns are zeros because the input had zeros there.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 7s in the second and fifth rows. The output has 4s in the second row (since it's the first three rows?), wait no, the first three rows. So the second row is the first row in the first three, so 7 becomes 4. The fifth row is the second row in the last three rows, so 7 becomes 4. The first and last columns of rows 1-3 and 7-9 remain zero.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 2s in the middle rows. The output has 4s in the same middle rows, but the first and last rows remain zeros regardless of the input.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n  - If the value is greater than 1, it becomes 4.\n  - However, if the cell is in the first three rows and in the first three columns, it remains 0, regardless of the input value.\n  - If the cell is in the last three rows, it becomes 4, regardless of the input value.\n\nThis seems to fit all the examples. Let me check if this rule applies to all the examples.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- The first three rows have 6s in the first three columns. According to the rule, since it's the first three rows and the first three columns, they remain 0.\n- The last three rows of the first three columns are zeros, which remain 0.\n- Other cells in the first three rows become 4s where the input had 6s.\n- In rows 4-6, the first three columns are zeros, which remain zero.\n- The rest of the cells in rows 4-6 become 4s where the input had non-zero values.\n\nThis matches the output of Example 1.\n\nIn Example 2:\n- The first three rows have 7s in the second row. According to the rule, since it's the first three rows and the second column is not in the first three columns, the 7 becomes 4.\n- The fifth row, which is the second row in the last three, has 7s. According to the rule, since it's the last three rows, the 7 becomes 4.\n- The first and last columns of rows 1-3 and 7-9 remain zero.\n- The rest of the cells in rows 4-6 become 4s where the input had non-zero values.\n\nThis matches the output of Example 2.\n\nIn Example 3:\n- The first and last rows of all columns remain zero, regardless of the input.\n- The middle rows have 2s, which become 4s according to the rule.\n- Other cells in the first and last rows remain zero.\n\nThis matches the output of Example 3.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the rule is as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n- If the cell's value is greater than 1, it is converted to 4.\n- If the cell is in the first three rows and in the first three columns, it remains 0.\n- If the cell is in the last three rows, it remains 4, regardless of the input value.\n\nThis explains how the output grids are formed based on the input grids in all three examples.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are two examples provided, and I need to find a pattern that applies to both. Let's start by looking at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, let's take Example 1. The input grid is a 9x8 grid with mostly zeros and a few 6s. The output grid is also 9x8, with a mix of zeros, fours, sixes, and other numbers. The presence of 6s in the input seems to influence the output, so I suspect that the rule involves some kind of transformation based on the values in the input.\n\nLooking at the input and output, I notice that in the first row of the input, there are all zeros except the middle part, which is filled with 0s. The output also has zeros in that position. The second row has a 6 in the middle, and the corresponding output cell also has a 4. Similarly, other rows with 6s in the input lead to certain cells in the output being 4s or 6s.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input grid has a lot of 7s in the bottom right and some other positions, but the output is different, mostly zeros except for some 4s and 0s. Hmm, this might be a clue that the rule is more about the edges of the grid.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has some 3s and 0s, and the output follows a similar pattern but with different values. This suggests that the rule isn't just a simple count or multiplication of the input values but might involve some other operation.\n\nLet me try to analyze the first few rows of the input and output to see if I can spot a pattern. In the first row of Example 1, the output has zeros where the input has zeros, and in the middle 6s, the output becomes 4s. So maybe it's about how many 6s are in a row or column.\n\nLooking at the second row of Example 1, the input has a single 6 in the middle, and the output cell is 4. Maybe the output cell's value depends on how many 6s are in the corresponding row or column. If there's one 6, it might be turned into a 4, and if there are more, it could stay as 4.\n\nWait, in the third row of Example 1, there are three 6s in the middle, and the output cell for that position is 4. That seems consistent. So perhaps each output cell is determined by the number of 6s in the corresponding row or column of the input.\n\nBut let's check another part. The fourth row of the input has a single 2 in the middle, and the output cell is 4, which matches the previous pattern. Similarly, the fifth row has two 2s, but the output is zeros. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's not just the count of 6s, but something else.\n\nWait, in the fifth row of Example 1, the input has two 2s, and the output is zeros. So maybe when there are two 6s, it's turned into a zero? Or perhaps when there are certain patterns of 6s, it's turned into zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell is determined by the sum of the input values in its row and column, but that seems unlikely because the output doesn't always match that.\n\nAnother approach is to look at how the 6s are distributed. In the input, the 6s seem to be concentrated in the middle, and in the output, those positions become 4s. Maybe the rule is that any cell with a 6 in the input becomes a 4 in the output, and cells with 0s become 0s, while other values might be affected differently.\n\nBut in the third row of Example 1, there are three 6s, and the output cell is 4, which is consistent. In the fourth row, there's a single 2, and the output is 4. So perhaps the rule is that each 6 in the input becomes a 4 in the output, and other cells remain the same. But that doesn't explain why the fifth row has 0s; maybe other cells also change based on their own rules.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has 7s in the bottom right, and the output has 4s in certain positions. Maybe the 7s are transformed into 4s, but how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, some cells are 4s and others are 0s. The positions where the input has 7s in the last row might be transformed into 4s in the output. So perhaps the rule is that any cell in the last row with a 7 becomes a 4, and zeros elsewhere.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the rule is as follows:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid, if the cell is in the last row and has a value of 7, it becomes a 4 in the output.\n- For all other cells, they remain the same as the input.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1. In the fifth row of the input, all are zeros, so the output remains zeros. In the sixth row, there are two 2s, so the output remains as zeros. The seventh row has three 6s, so the third output cell would be 4, but in the example, the output is different. Wait, in Example 1, the seventh row's output is all 6s except the third cell, which is 4. So perhaps the rule is more complex than just the last row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves checking the number of 6s in the row or column. For example, if a row has more than one 6, it turns into 4s, and if it has exactly one 6, it turns into 4, while zeros remain 0. This might explain the output patterns.\n\nBut let's look at Example 3. The input has 3s and 0s, and the output also follows a pattern. The output has 3s in many positions, and some cells become 4s and 0s based on the input values.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the sixth row of the input has two 0s, and the output has two 0s in the same positions. So perhaps cells with 0s stay as 0s, while cells with other values are transformed based on their own rules.\n\nPutting all this together, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each cell, if the cell is in the last row and has a value of 7, it becomes a 4.\n- For all other cells, if the cell is a 0, it remains 0.\n- If the cell has a value other than 0 or 7, it remains the same as the input.\n- Additionally, in some cases, other transformations might occur, such as cell (1,3) turning into 4 when the input has 6s.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first row of the output has 0s, but the input has zeros except for the middle part, which is also zeros. So perhaps the rule is more about the edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves checking the sum of the row or column. For example, if the sum of the row is more than a certain value, it turns into 4s.\n\nBut looking at Example 1, the first input row has mostly zeros, so the output is zeros. The second row has a sum of 2 (since 6 + 6 = 12, but the input is 6s in the middle, so maybe the sum is 12). The output cell is 4, which might indicate that when the sum is high enough, it becomes 4.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let's try to find a pattern by looking at multiple examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 7s in the last row, and the output has 4s in those positions. So perhaps the rule is that any 7 in the last row becomes a 4, while other cells remain the same.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s and 0s, and the output has 3s in many positions, while some become 4s or 0s based on their own values.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each cell, if it is in the last row and has a value of 7, it becomes a 4.\n- All other cells remain the same as the input.\n- Additionally, for cells that are in the last row and have a value of 2, they become 4s.\n- For cells in other rows, if they are 0, they remain 0. If they are 6, they become 4.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's check Example 1 again. In the second row, the input has a 6 in the middle, and the output cell is 4, which fits. In the sixth row, the input has two 0s, and the output has two 0s, which fits. The seventh row has three 6s, and the third cell is 4, which fits. The eighth row has three 3s and a single 2, and the output has 3s and a 4 in the middle, which fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 7s in the last row, and the output has 4s in those positions, which fits. The other rows remain the same, so the pattern holds.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s and 0s, and the output has 3s in many positions, with some 4s and 0s based on their values. For example, the first row has 3s, the second row has 4s in certain positions, and the third row has 4s in the middle.\n\nSo putting this together, the rule seems to be:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n  - If the cell is in the last row and has a value of 7, it becomes a 4.\n  - If the cell is in the last row and has a value of 2, it becomes a 4.\n  - For all other cells, they remain unchanged.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the third row has three 6s, and the output cell is 4, which fits. In the fourth row, the input has a single 2, and the output is 4, which also fits.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that any cell in the last row with a 7 or a 2 becomes a 4, while all other cells remain unchanged.\n\nThis seems to explain the outputs in all examples. So applying this rule to the input in Example 3:\n\n- The seventh row of the input has three 6s, so the third output cell becomes 4.\n- The other rows remain as per the input.\n\nLooking at the output in Example 3, the first and second rows have 3s, which matches the input. The third row has 4s in the middle, which fits. The fourth row has 0s and 4s, which also match.\n\nSo the rule seems to be consistent across all the examples. Therefore, the rule is:\n\n- For each cell, if it is in the last row and has a value of 7 or 2, it becomes a 4.\n- All other cells remain the same.\n\nThis explains the outputs in all the provided examples.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by comparing the examples given to see if there's a pattern or a common rule.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a grid where most of the numbers are 0, except for some rows and columns where there are 6 and 0s. The output grid has a mix of 0s, 4s, and other numbers. It seems like the output is influenced by the non-zero values in the input.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has some 7s in certain cells, and the output grid has corresponding 4s placed in specific positions. It looks like when there's a 7 in the input, the output has a 4 in certain areas, but not every time. The rule might be that whenever there's a 7, the output cell is 4, but with some exceptions based on the surrounding cells.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 3s and 0s, except for some 2s and 0s. The output seems similar to the first examples, with 3s and 4s appearing in certain positions. It might be that when a cell has a certain value, like 3 or 2, it affects the output in a specific way.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that the rule is based on the presence of non-zero values (like 3, 6, or 7) in the input. For each cell in the output, if the corresponding cell in the input has a 6 or 7, the output cell is set to 4. If the input cell is 3, the output might be 4 in specific positions, and 0 elsewhere. For 0s in the input, the output remains 0.\n\nSo the rule is: For each cell, if the input cell is 3, the output is 4 only if certain conditions are met (like being in a specific row or column with 0s or 6s). If the input cell is 6 or 7, the output is 4 regardless of other values. All other cells remain 0.\n\nTherefore, applying this rule to the given input grid should yield the correct output grid.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 0 4 0 0 4\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 4 4 4 0 0\n0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n0 6 4 4 4 6 0\n0 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 7\n0 0 0 4 7 4 4 4 7\n0 0 4 0 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully examining both examples to see if I can spot any patterns or similarities.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput grid has a lot of zeros except for some 6s. The output grid has a mix of zeros and numbers, with a few non-zero entries. It seems like the 6s in the input are being converted into 4s in certain positions of the output. But wait, not all 6s are converted; only some of them are. For instance, the 6 in the second row of the input doesn't turn into a 4 in the same row of the output. Hmm, maybe the rule isn't just a direct substitution.\n\nLet me look at Example 2:\n\nIn the input, there are a few 7s and some zeros. The output grid has a bunch of zeros except for a few 4s. It looks like each 7 might be being converted into 4s in specific cells. For example, the 7s in the second, fourth, seventh, and eighth rows of the input are all turning into 4s in the output. That seems consistent. But again, not every 7 is converted; only certain ones. How does that work?\n\nExample 3 has some 3s and 0s. The output seems to follow a similar pattern, where non-zero cells are converted to 4s, but again, not all are converted. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero value in the input is converted to 4 in the output, but only in certain positions.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has 4s in some areas, but not all. Maybe it's a combination of both examples. Let's think about the positions where the output is non-zero. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in the first row (except the last two zeros), and 0s elsewhere. In Example 2, the output has 4s in the second, fourth, seventh, and eighth rows, but zeros elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output grid is determined by the maximum number of non-zero cells in its row or column in the input grid. Or maybe it's the sum of non-zero cells. Or perhaps it's the median or some other statistical measure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the number of diagonals or other structural properties.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at specific cells. For example, take the cell at position (1,1) in the input (second row, first column). Input is 0. Output is 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's based on the maximum of the surrounding area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves the count of non-zero cells in each row and column. For instance, if a row has more non-zero cells than another, the positions of the output might reflect that.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2, the output has more 4s in certain rows. For example, the second row has four 4s, but the fourth row has four as well. Maybe it's related to the number of 7s in each row or column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero cell in the input contributes to the output in a way that the output cell is the sum of the input cells in its row and column, divided by some factor.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the first row of the output is all zeros except for some 4s in the last two columns. Maybe the rule is that a cell is non-zero if the number of non-zero cells in its row and column is at least a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell in the output is the minimum of the number of non-zero cells in its row and column from the input.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the second row of the input has two 6s, so the output would have two 4s somewhere, but in the output, the second row has two 4s in positions 10 and 11. Maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is 4 if the corresponding cell in the input is 6, but only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero cell in the input is converted to 4 in the output, regardless of their position. But in Example 1, the output only has 4s in the last two positions, not all cells. So that can't be it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output grid is a scaled version of the input grid, with a factor applied. But looking at Example 1, the output has cells that are either 0, 4, or 6, which doesn't suggest a straightforward scaling.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero cell in the input is converted to 4 in the output, but only if it's in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 6s in the second, fourth, seventh, and eighth rows are being converted to 4s in the output, perhaps in specific columns or rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each non-zero cell in the input is converted to 4 if it's in a certain diagonal or if its position follows a specific pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the output grid, each cell is the sum of the number of non-zero cells in its row and column from the input grid, divided by some number. For example, if a cell has a row with 2 non-zero cells and a column with 2 non-zero cells, the output might be 4 (2+2). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell is determined by the product of the number of non-zero cells in its row and column. For example, if a row has 2 non-zero cells and a column has 3, the output might be 6. But in Example 1, the output is 4, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output cell is the minimum of the number of non-zero cells in its row and column multiplied by 2. For example, if a row has 2 and a column has 3, min(2,3)=2, multiplied by 2 gives 4. That might fit the 4s in the output.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 1:\n\nInput row 2 has two 6s, so non-zero cells in row 2: 2.\n\nInput column 10 has two 6s, so non-zero cells in column 10: 2.\n\nOutput cell (2,10): min(2,2)*2=4. That matches.\n\nInput row 4 has two 6s, so non-zero cells in row 4: 2.\n\nInput column 6 has four 6s, so non-zero cells in column 6:4.\n\nOutput cell (4,6): min(2,4)*2=4. That also matches.\n\nAnother example: Input row 7 has two 6s, so non-zero in row 7:2.\n\nInput column 9 has two 6s, so non-zero in column 9:2.\n\nOutput cell (7,9): min(2,2)*2=4. Correct.\n\nIn Example 2, the input row 2 has two 7s, but the output row 2 has four 4s, so min(2,2)*2=4 fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the input row 2 has one 3, so non-zero cells in row 2:1.\n\nInput column 1 has two 3s, so non-zero cells in column 1:2.\n\nOutput cell (2,1): min(1,2)*2=2. But in the output, it's 3, so this doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell is the sum of the non-zero cells in its row and column, divided by 2.\n\nIn Example 1, row 2 has 2, column 10 has 2, sum is 4, divided by 2 is 2. But the output is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the maximum of the non-zero cells in the row and column. For example, if row has 2 and column has 2, max is 2, but the output is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product of the non-zero cells in the row and column. For row 2, 2, column 10, 2, product is 4, which matches the output.\n\nTesting this with Example 2: row 2 has two 7s, so non-zero cells:2. Column 1 has two 7s, non-zero cells:2. Product is 4, which matches the output cell (2,1) as 4.\n\nIn Example 3, row 2 has one 3, non-zero cells:1. Column 1 has two 3s, non-zero cells:2. Product is 2, but the output cell (2,1) is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not the product. Alternatively, perhaps the output cell is the sum of the non-zero cells in the row and column, divided by 2.\n\nIn Example 1, sum is 4, divided by 2 is 2, but output is 4. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell is the number of non-zero cells in the input grid multiplied by some factor.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output has 4s in the last two cells of the first row. So perhaps the rule is that any cell is non-zero if the corresponding cell in the input is 6 (or 7 in the second example), and in the output, those cells are set to 4.\n\nBut in the second example, the output has 4s in cells that are 7s, but not all. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each non-zero cell in the input is converted to 4, but only if it's in a certain position or if it's part of a specific pattern.\n\nWait, maybe it's based on the number of non-zero cells in each row and column. For example, if a row has more non-zero cells than another, the corresponding cells in the output are set to 4.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where the output has 4s. For example, in the first row, the last two cells are 4s. That might correspond to some pattern in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each 6 in the input is converted to 4 in the output, but only in certain positions. For instance, in the second row of the input, the 6s are in columns 1 and 2, and the output 4s are in columns 10 and 11. But that's a big jump, so maybe it's based on the distance from the edge or something.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is 4 if the corresponding cell in the input is 6 and it's in a certain region. For example, in the second example, the 7s in the second row of the input are converted to 4s, but in other rows, only some 7s are converted.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to find a general rule based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output cells are 4 where the input has 6s in certain positions. The output has 4s in the last two cells of the first row. Perhaps the rule is that each 6 in the input is converted to a 4 in the output, but only in the first row, columns 10 and 11.\n\nSimilarly, in the second example, the 7s in the second, fourth, seventh, and eighth rows of the input are converted to 4s in the output. So the rule might be that each 7 in the input is converted to a 4 in the output, but only in certain rows or columns.\n\nBut then, in the third example, the 3s and 0s are converted to 4s, but not all of them. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero cell in the input is converted to 4, but only in certain positions or based on some condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is 4 if the corresponding cell in the input is 6 or 7, but only in certain rows or columns. For example, in the second example, the output has 4s in the second, fourth, seventh, and eighth rows, which correspond to the 7s in the second, fourth, seventh, and eighth rows of the input.\n\nSimilarly, in the first example, the 6s in the second row are converted to 4s in the first row, columns 10 and 11.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that each 6 or 7 in the input is converted to a 4 in the output, but only in specific cells. For instance, the 6s in the second row are converted to 4s in the first row, columns 10 and 11.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output grid is derived by taking the input grid, replacing each 6 or 7 with 4, but only in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the second row and columns 1 and 2, but the output 4s are in columns 10 and 11 of the first row.\n\nThis suggests that the rule is not straightforward and might involve some geometric relationship between the input and output cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each 6 in the input is converted to a 4 in the output, but only if it's in a specific row or column. For example, in the second row, the 6s are converted to 4s in the first two columns of the first row.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Maybe the rule is that each 6 in the input is converted to a 4 in the output, but only in certain positions based on their row or column.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to determine the exact rule. Maybe I should try to find a consistent rule based on the examples.\n\nLet me try to summarize what I've observed:\n\n- In Example 1, the output has 4s in the last two cells of the first row, which corresponds to some 6s in the input, but not all of them.\n- In Example 2, the output has 4s in specific rows (second, fourth, seventh, eighth) and columns (10, 11, etc.), corresponding to 7s in the input.\n- In Example 3, the output has 4s in certain positions based on 3s and 0s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that any non-zero cell in the input is converted to a 4 in the output, but only in certain positions or based on certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each 6 in the input is converted to a 4 in the output, but only if it's in a specific row or column. For example, in Example 1, the 6s in the second row are converted to 4s in the first two columns of the first row.\n\nBut without a clear rule, it's challenging to apply it to the given input.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is 4 if the corresponding cell in the input is 6 or 7, but only if the cell is in the first row or certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is 4 if the corresponding cell in the input is 6 or 7, but only in certain rows or columns, like the first row or specific rows.\n\nBut given the examples, the rule seems to involve replacing certain non-zero values (6s and 7s) with 4s in specific cells of the output grid.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\n- If the input cell (i, j) is 6 or 7, then the output cell is 4, but only if i = 0 or j is in a certain range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero cell in the input is converted to 4 in the output, but only if it's in the first row or specific columns.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to be certain.\n\nGiven the examples and the outputs, the rule seems to be that any non-zero cell in the input grid is converted to 4 in the output grid, but only in specific positions or based on certain conditions, such as rows or columns. This might involve a transformation where certain values are scaled or replaced under specific conditions.\n\nSo, to predict the output grid, I would apply the rule that any non-zero cell in the input is converted to 4 in the output, but only in specific positions or based on certain patterns, such as the first row or certain columns.\n\nHowever, without a clear rule, the exact transformation isn't evident.

Let's look at the examples given to figure out what's going on.\n\nFirst, let's take Example 1. The input has a lot of zeros except for a few 6s. The output grid has certain numbers, mostly zeros and fours, with a couple of sixes. Hmm, I wonder what's special about the 6s in the input. Maybe they are being transformed into something else.\n\nLooking closer, in the input of Example 1, the 6s are in positions that are surrounded by 2s. Wait, maybe that's not it. Let me check the output. The output has 4s in some positions where the input has 6s. So perhaps each 6 is being converted to a 4.\n\nBut wait, let me check another example to confirm. In Example 2, the input has a 7 in certain positions, and the output has 4s and 7s in those places. For instance, the output has a 4 in the position where the input had a 7. So maybe each number in the input is being replaced by a certain value in the output based on some rule.\n\nLet me try to find a consistent rule. Looking at the first input and output:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo nothing changes here.\n\nNext input row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the first element changes from 0 to 4.\n\nAnother input row: 0 6 6 0 6 6 0\nOutput row: 0 6 6 4 6 6 0\n\nHere, the first element remains 0, but the 6s become 6s in the output. Wait, but the fourth element changes from 0 to 4. So maybe it's not just replacing 6s.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe the output is based on some operations on the input grid. For example, maybe each cell in the output is the sum of the corresponding cells in the two input rows, modulo something.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and a few 6s. The output has 4s and zeros elsewhere, except for some 4s. Maybe the rule involves adding adjacent elements or something.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is derived by looking at the input grid and applying a transformation where each cell's value is determined by the sum of its neighboring cells or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by multiplying each value by a certain factor based on its position.\n\nWait, let's take Example 1 again. The input has 6s in positions that are surrounded by 2s. The output has 4s in those positions. Maybe the rule is that whenever a cell has a 6, it's converted to a 4.\n\nBut let's check another example. In Example 2, the input has a 7 in certain positions, and the output has 4s in those positions. So maybe each 7 is converted to a 4.\n\nWait, but in the first input row of Example 1, the 6s are in positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 (assuming 1-based indexing). The output for those positions are 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 0. So it seems that only the fourth position (index 4, since it's zero-based) is changing from 0 to 4.\n\nThis suggests that the rule isn't uniform across all positions. Maybe it's based on some pattern or specific condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in each row, if there's a 6, it's replaced by a 4, and the surrounding 2s are replaced by something else. Or maybe the 6s are in positions where the surrounding cells are 2s, and those are converted to 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 6 in the input is converted to a 4 in the output, and the surrounding 2s are converted to 0 or something.\n\nBut let's look at another example. In Example 2, the output has a 4 where the input had a 7. So maybe each 7 is converted to a 4. But in Example 1, the 6s are converted to 6s in most cases, except for the fourth position, which becomes 4.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps the rule isn't about replacing 6s, but about some other transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the sum of the adjacent cells in the input. For example, each cell in the output is the sum of its top, left, and right neighbors in the input.\n\nLet me test that hypothesis. For instance, in the first row of Example 1, the first cell is 0. The sum of its neighbors (which are all 0s) would be 0, but the output is 0, so that matches. The second cell is 0, but in the output, it's still 0. Similarly, all cells in the input are 0 except for certain positions, so the sum would be 0, which matches the output.\n\nLooking at the second row of Example 1:\n\nInput: 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf I consider the sum of the input cells around each position, maybe it's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps each 6 in the input is converted to a 4, and 0s remain 0s. But in the output, some 6s remain, and others become 4s.\n\nWait, but in the first row of Example 1, the output's first cell is 0, same as the input. The second cell is 0, same as input. The third cell is 6, same as input. The fourth cell is 4, which is a change. Maybe the rule is that any 6 in the input becomes a 4 in the output, and 2s become something else.\n\nBut in the first row of Example 1, there are 6s in positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. The output for these positions is 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 0. So the fourth position (index 4) becomes 4, but others remain 6. So maybe the rule is that if a cell has a 6, it's converted to 4, except when it's in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each 6 is converted to a 4, and each 2 is converted to a 0. But in the output, the 6s remain as 6s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a result of some kind of translation or shifting, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by subtracting 2 from each cell in the input, but that would change 0s to -2, which doesn't match the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is based on the number of 2s around each cell. For example, if a cell has more 2s in its neighborhood, it's converted to a higher number.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 6s are in positions surrounded by 2s. The output has 4s in those positions. Maybe each 6 is converted to a 4, and the surrounding 2s are converted to 0s.\n\nBut let me check another example. In Example 2, a 7 in the input is converted to a 4 in the output. So maybe each 7 is converted to a 4. But in the first row of Example 1, the 6s remain 6s, so perhaps the rule is that 6s are converted to 4s, but in some positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 6 in the input is converted to a 4, and 2s are converted to 0s, while 0s remain 0s. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- The 6s are in positions that become 4s in the output.\n- The 2s in the input remain 0s in the output.\n\nSo applying this rule, the output should have 4s in those positions where the input had 6s, and 0s elsewhere, except for the first row where the first cell remains 0.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the first cell is 0, same as input. The second cell is 0, same as input. The third cell is 6, same as input. The fourth cell is 4, which matches. Then the rest are 6s and 0s, which matches the input's 6s and 2s.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input also has some 2s. Let me check if the rule applies to all 2s. If the rule is to convert 6s to 4s and 2s to 0s, then in the input, the 2s would become 0s, which matches the output.\n\nBut let me check another example. In Example 2, the input has a 7, which is converted to a 4. So perhaps each 7 is converted to a 4. Also, any other numbers would remain the same?\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has a 4 where the input had a 7. So maybe the rule is that each 7 in the input is converted to a 4 in the output. Other numbers remain the same.\n\nSo, putting this together, the rule seems to be:\n\n- Replace every 6 in the input with a 4 in the output.\n- Replace every 7 in the input with a 4 in the output.\n- Leave all other numbers unchanged.\n\nBut let me check if this holds in all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4s in positions where the input had 6s, and 0s where the input had 2s. So yes, this matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 4s where the input had 7s, and the rest remain the same.\n\nIn Example 3, let's see:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\nSo, in the second row (input row 2), the 0s become 4s, except the middle 0 which is in a position that becomes 4 as well. Similarly, in the third row, the middle 0 becomes 4. In the fourth row, the 0s become 4s in certain positions.\n\nSo this suggests that 0s are being converted to 4s, which aligns with the previous rule: replacing 0s and 2s with 0s, and 6s and 7s with 4s.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the input has 0s in some positions, and the output has 4s there. So perhaps the rule is that any 0 in the input becomes a 4 in the output, except when it's in a certain position relative to other numbers.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 4s in positions where the input had 6s, not in 0s. So perhaps the rule is that 6s and 7s are converted to 4s, while 0s and 2s remain 0s.\n\nThis fits the examples:\n\n- Example 1: 6s \u2192 4s, 2s \u2192 0s.\n- Example 2: 7s \u2192 4s, others remain.\n- Example 3: 0s \u2192 4s, while other numbers remain 0 or as per the input.\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\n- Replace every 6 or 7 in the input with a 4.\n- Replace every 0 in the input with a 4.\n- Leave all other numbers unchanged.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the last input grid in Example 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAccording to the rule, the 0s become 4s, so all 0s in the input become 4s in the output. The other numbers (3s, 6s, 7s) remain unchanged.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nLet me construct the output row by row:\n\nFirst row: all 3s remain 3s.\nSecond row: the 0s become 4s, so the second and fifth elements are 4.\nThird row: same as second, becomes 3s except the second and fifth positions \u2192 4s.\nFourth row: same as second and third \u2192 3s except second and fifth \u2192 4s.\nFifth row: all 0s become 4s.\nSixth row: all 0s become 4s.\n\nWait, but the expected output in Example 3 is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\nWait, that doesn't match my earlier reasoning. Hmm, so perhaps my rule is incorrect.\n\nLet me check the output provided in Example 3:\n\nThe output has:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\nWait, in the fourth row, the output is [3 3 4 4 3 3], which aligns with my rule. The fifth row is [0 4 4 4 4 0], which also aligns. The sixth row is [4 0 4 4 0 4], which also aligns with the rule.\n\nWait, but the input's fifth and sixth rows are all 0s. According to my rule, they should all become 4s. But the output has [4 4 4 4 4 4] for the fifth and sixth rows. So perhaps my initial rule was correct, and the output in Example 3 has a mistake? Or perhaps I misunderstood the examples.\n\nWait, no, looking back, in Example 3, the output is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n0 4 4 4 4 0\n4 0 4 4 0 4\n\nSo the fifth row is [0 4 4 4 4 0], which matches my rule. The sixth row is [4 0 4 4 0 4], which also matches. So my initial rule seems correct.\n\nSo, applying the rule to the last input grid, which is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAccording to the rule, the 0s become 4s, so all 0s in the input become 4s.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nBut wait, in the fourth row, according to the output, it's [3 3 4 4 3 3], which matches, because the third and fifth elements become 4.\n\nWait, but in the fifth row, the output has [4 4 4 4 4 4], which is correct because all 0s become 4s.\n\nSimilarly, the sixth row becomes [4 4 4 4 4 4].\n\nSo the final output grid is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 4 4 4 4 3\n3 3 4 4 3 3\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nWhich should be the correct output for the last example.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 5 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 5 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 5 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples provided show some transformations, so I'll start by analyzing those.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a single 5 in the middle. The output grid seems to have a bunch of 0s except for a 5 in the center, but I notice some other numbers. Wait, the first row in the output is all 0s, but the second row has a 0 except the second position which is 0, and then it's filled with 0s except maybe some 1s? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, looking closer, the output in Example 1 seems to have a pattern where each row is mostly 0s but with a 5 in the first row and 0s elsewhere, but that's not consistent with the other rows. Maybe I'm looking at it wrong.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps each cell in the output is determined by some operation on the corresponding cell and its neighbors in the input. Maybe it's a sliding window or applying some filter.\n\nWait, in the first example, the second row of the input has a 5 in the middle. The output's second row has 0s except the first, third, and fifth positions, which are 0s. So perhaps it's not a simple filter. Maybe it's more about the number of non-zero elements or something else.\n\nLooking at Example 2, I see that the input has a 5 in the second row, and the output has 5s in the same place. Also, some rows have 1s, like in the third row of the output, which has two 1s. Maybe when a cell has non-zero values, it affects the output by propagating the 5 and 1s somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the number of non-zero 5s in the corresponding 3x3 neighborhood of the input grid. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 5 in the center. So around it, the 3x3 area would have that 5 and maybe other 0s or 5s. If there's only one 5, then the output cell would have 1. But in the output, the second row's second cell is 0, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by counting the number of 5s in the 3x3 area, but considering that each 5 in the input propagates to multiple output cells. For example, a single 5 in the input might affect several cells in the output.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has a 5 in the second row, and the output also has a 5 in that position. But looking at the output's third row, I see two 1s. Maybe when multiple 5s are present, the output gets 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output grid and see if it's related to the input grid's values. For instance, in the first row of the output, all are 0s, which might mean that if the corresponding input cell is 0, the output is 0. But that's not always the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in the 3x3 neighborhood of each cell. Let's see: for the center cell in each 3x3 area, if all are 0, the output is 0. If there's a 5, then the output could be 5. But in the first row of the output, all are 0, which suggests that maybe it's not taking the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation of the sum of the 3x3 neighborhood. But in Example 1, the input has a 5, which might add up to higher numbers, but the output's second row has 0s, which doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe it's a bitwise operation, like OR-ing the neighboring cells. Let's see: if any of the 3x3 cells is non-zero, the output cell is 1. But in Example 1, the output has 0s, which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is a reflection or transformation of the input. For example, subtracting the input from 5, but that doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nWait, maybe the output grid is derived from the input grid by some kind of convolution. Like, each cell in the output is the sum of certain cells in the input. For example, each output cell might be the sum of the 3x3 area centered on the input cell.\n\nLet me try that. For the first row of the output, all are 0, which would mean that in the 3x3 areas around each input cell, the sum is 0. That suggests that the input cells in those areas are 0, except for the center, which might be 5, but then the sum could be 5. Hmm, but the output is 0, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it's the other way around. For each output cell, it's the sum of the 3x3 neighborhood in the input, but multiplied by some factor. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a bitwise AND of the input and some mask. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3, the input has a 5 in the second row and a 4 in the fourth row. The output's fourth row has 4s and 0s elsewhere. Hmm, that's interesting. So the 5 in the input becomes a 5 in the output, but the 4 becomes a 4. Wait, but the output in Example 3's fourth row is 4s and 0s. That might be a clue.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the sum of the input cell and its neighbors, but only if the sum is non-zero. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is the input grid transformed by a certain filter, like a derivative or some other operation. For example, applying a Laplacian filter or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a transformation that zeroes out certain regions based on the input's values. For example, if a cell has a 5, it becomes 5, and other cells are set to 0. But in Example 2, the output has 1s in certain cells even when the input has 0s, so that's probably not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a binary transformation, where each cell is 1 if any of the 3x3 neighbors is non-zero, and 0 otherwise. But in Example 1, the output's second row has a 0 in the middle, which would imply that the center cell is 0, which contradicts the idea that if any neighbor is non-zero, it's 1.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output grids, I notice that in each row, the first and last few cells are 0, except for the first row of the output, which is all 0s. Wait, no, in Example 2, the first row is 0s, but the second row is all 0s except for the second position. So maybe the rule isn't about the entire grid but about certain cells.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the maximum of the 3x3 neighborhood in the input. For example, if any cell in the 3x3 area is non-zero, the output cell is the maximum of those cells. But in Example 1, the output's second row has 0s, which would imply that the maximum in the 3x3 area around that cell is 0, which would mean that all the cells in the 3x3 area are 0, which contradicts the input having a 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the minimum. But the output in Example 1 still doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's a combination of the maximum and minimum. For example, each output cell is the average of the maximum and minimum in the 3x3 neighborhood. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: let's look at the first example's input and output. The input has a 5 in the center, and the output has a 5 in the center. But the second row of the output has 0s, which suggests that the neighboring cells are 0. Maybe the rule is that each output cell is the sum of the 3x3 neighborhood, but only if the sum is greater than 0. But in the first row, the sum of the 3x3 neighborhood around the center would be 5 plus the surrounding 0s, so the output cell would be 5. But in the output, it's 0, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is 1 if any of the 3x3 neighbors is non-zero, and 0 otherwise. Let me test this in the first example. The output's second row has 0s in the center, which would mean that the 3x3 neighborhood around the center has 0s. But that's not the case because the input has a 5 at the center, so the output should be 1. But the output's second row's second cell is 0, which contradicts this idea.\n\nI'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the test input grid provided and see what the rule would produce.\n\nThe test input grid has a 5 in the second row, a 4 in the fourth row, and a 4 in the sixth row. The output grid for this test is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, looking at the test input, the 3rd row (index 2) has a 4, the 4th row (index 3) has a 4, and the 6th row (index 5) has a 4. The output for the 3rd row has a 3 in the first cell, and the 4th row has a 3 in the first cell, and the 6th row has a 3 in the first cell.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each output cell is the average of the input cell and its neighbors, but rounded to the nearest integer. For example, in the test input, the 3rd row has a 4, and the output's first cell is 3, which could be 4 - 1. Maybe it's subtracting something.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe the output is the original grid minus the grid shifted by one in all directions, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the maximum of the 3x3 neighborhood, but only if the maximum is non-zero. But in the test input, the output's first cell is 0, which would imply that the maximum in its 3x3 neighborhood is 0, which contradicts the input having a 4 or 5.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each output cell is the minimum of the 3x3 neighborhood. For example, if any cell in the neighborhood is 5, the output cell is 5. But in the test input, the first cell is 0, which would mean that the minimum in its neighborhood is 0, which doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the test input and output.\n\nIn the test input, the 7th row has a 3, and the output for that cell is 3. The 9th row has a 3, and the output is 3. The 11th row has a 3, and the output is 3. So, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the same as the input cell if it's 0, and otherwise, it's the output of some function of the 3x3 neighborhood.\n\nWait, looking at the first row of the output, all are 0. So maybe the first row is all 0s regardless of the input, but that doesn't fit the other rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the sum of the 3x3 neighborhood divided by 9. So, for a cell with value 4, the sum of its 3x3 neighborhood is 36, so divided by 9 is 4, which matches the output's first cell. Similarly, a 5 would give 25/9 \u2248 2.777, which would round down to 2 or 3, but the output in Example 1 has 0 in that cell, so that can't be right.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Perhaps I should consider that the rule is to replace each 0 with 0, and each non-zero with the sum of its neighbors. But in the first example, the input has a 5, so the output's corresponding cell would be 5, but the output's second row's second cell is 0, which contradicts this idea.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each output cell is 1 if the input cell is non-zero and all its neighbors are also non-zero, and 0 otherwise. Let me test this.\n\nIn the first example, the input has a 5 in the center. The 3x3 neighborhood around the center has mostly 0s, so the output cell would be 0. But in the output, the center is 0, which fits. For the cells around the center, if they are 0 in the input, they remain 0. But in the input, the 3x3 areas around the center have 0s, so the output cells in those areas would be 0, which matches the output.\n\nIn the second example, the input has a 5 in the second row. The 3x3 neighborhood around it includes other 5s, so the output cell would be 5, which is correct. The 1s around it would also have 5 as their maximum, which matches the output.\n\nIn the third example, the input has a 5 in the second row and 4s in the fourth and sixth rows. The 3x3 neighborhood around the 5 would have 5s, so the output cell would be 5, which matches the output's second row. The 4s in the fourth and sixth rows would have their 3x3 neighborhoods include 5s, so their output cells would be 5, but in the output, they are 4, so that doesn't fit. Wait, no, the output's fourth and sixth rows have 4s in the first cell and 0s elsewhere. That suggests that the 4s are being transformed into 4s, which contradicts this idea.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that each output cell is the sum of the 3x3 neighborhood, but only if the sum is non-zero, otherwise 0. So, a cell with 0 remains 0, a cell with 5 in the neighborhood becomes 5, and a cell with 1 in the neighborhood becomes 1. But in the third example, the output's fourth and sixth rows have 4s, which would correspond to neighborhoods that have a sum of 16 (4*4) or something, but 16 is 4, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the opposite: each output cell is the sum of the 3x3 neighborhood divided by 9, but only if the sum is non-zero, else 0. So for a 5, the sum is 25, 25/9 \u2248 2.777, which would round to 3, but the output's first cell is 3, which matches.

Let me start by carefully looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids are quite similar except for some cells. The input grid has a lot of zeros except for a few 5s. The output grid seems to have the same 5s in specific positions. Let me see which positions are the same.\n\nIn the first row of the input, there's a 0, and in the output, it's also 0. The second row has a 0 in the input and the output is 0. The 5 in the fifth row of the input is transformed into a 1 in the same position in the output. It looks like whenever there's a 5 in the input, the output cell becomes 1, and all other cells become 0.\n\nLet me verify this with another example. In Example 2, the input grid has some non-zero values, and the output grid has corresponding non-zeros. For instance, the sixth row of the input has a 5 and two 8s, and in the output, those same cells have 1s. So again, the 5 in the input turns into a 1 in the output, and the 8s remain as 1s. Wait, but in Example 1, the 8 wasn't present in the input, so the output cells didn't change.\n\nAnother example is Example 3. The input has a 5 in the seventh row, and the output shows a 1 there. The other cells with non-zero values in the input remain as 1s in the output. So the rule seems to be: any cell with a 5 in the input grid becomes a 1 in the output, and all other cells are 0.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each cell, if the input value is 5, the output is 1; otherwise, the output is 0.

There are three examples provided, and I need to figure out what rule applies to all of them. Let me try to understand the patterns first.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input grid has a lot of zeros except for a few positions. For example, in the third row from the top, there's a 5 and then five zeros. The output grid seems to have the same pattern but with a few changes. In the third row, instead of five zeros, it's 1s. I'm noticing that maybe the output grid is a binary grid where certain cells are turned on based on the input.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input grid has some 5s and 8s in specific positions. The output grid in this case also has a lot of zeros and some 5s and 8s, but arranged differently. It seems like the rule might involve checking the number of 5s or 8s in some pattern and turning on certain cells based on that count.\n\nNow, looking at Example 3, the input has a 5 in the first row and several 8s. The output grid has multiple 5s and some 8s arranged in a way that's a bit more complex. Maybe the rule is that if there are certain numbers in specific positions, the output grid will have a 5 or an 8 in those spots.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the rule is related to the presence of 5s and 8s in specific regions of the grid. For instance, in Example 1, the output grid has 1s where the input had 5s. In Example 2, the 5s and 8s in the input correspond to 5s in the output in specific locations. In Example 3, it's a bit more complicated, but again, specific regions are being transformed.\n\nI think the rule is that each cell in the output grid is 1 if the corresponding cell in the input grid is 5 or 8 in certain regions, and 0 otherwise. But I need to confirm this by looking at all the examples.\n\nLooking at the first example, the output grid has 1s in the third row where the input had a 5. So that supports the idea that 5s in certain areas cause 1s in the output. Similarly, in the second example, the 5s are in specific positions, and the output reflects that. The third example seems to follow a similar pattern with 5s and 8s.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the output has 5s in some corners, but the input had 5s in the first row. So maybe the rule is that any cell that was a 5 in the input will be a 5 in the output, regardless of their position, as long as they're in specific regions. Or perhaps it's more about regions rather than individual cells.\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of 5s in certain regions. For example, in the output grids, the number of 5s in the corners seems to be the same as in the input. So maybe the rule is that certain regions (like corners) are 5s in the output if they were 5s in the input.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the rule is that for each cell, if there's a 5 or 8 in a specific pattern in the input, the corresponding cell in the output will be 1, otherwise 0. But I need to map this accurately.\n\nLooking at the examples again, I notice that in the output grids, the positions of 5s and 8s seem to be following a pattern where they're placed in certain rows and columns based on the input. For example, in the first example, the 5 in the input causes a 1 in the output in the third row. In the second example, the 5 in the input causes a 5 in the output in the middle row. In the third example, the 5 in the input causes a 5 in the output in the first and fourth rows.\n\nSo the rule could be that any 5 in the input grid results in a 1 in the corresponding position in the output grid, but only if that position is in a specific region defined by the input. Alternatively, it might be that any cell in the output grid is a 1 if there's a 5 or 8 in a particular area in the input.\n\nWait, looking at the output grids, it seems like the output grids have a lot of 0s and a few 5s or 8s, but their positions aren't just determined by the presence of 5s in the input but by a more complex rule involving regions. For example, in the first example, the 5 in the input causes a 1 in the output in the third row. The output grid has 1s in the third row, but the input had a 5 only there. So maybe the rule is that any cell in the output that's in the same row and column as the 5 in the input is a 1, but that doesn't seem to be the case because the output in the second example has 1s in different positions.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output grids. For example, in the first example, the third row has four 0s and a 1. In the second example, the middle row has a 1. In the third example, the first and fourth rows have 1s. It seems like the 1s are placed in specific rows and columns based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is a binary representation of the input grid's 5s, but arranged in a certain way. For example, in the first output grid, the 1s are in the third row, which is the same as the position of the 5 in the input. In the second output grid, the 1 is in the middle row, which might be another specific pattern.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the output grid is a binary grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 5 or 8 in the corresponding position in the input grid. But that doesn't seem to fit because in the second example, the 5s are in different positions and the output has 5s in different spots.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be based on the sum of the input grid's values in certain regions. For example, if a region has a 5, then the corresponding output cell is 1. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to find a common rule by comparing the input and output grids across all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 5 in the third row, and the output has a 1 in the third row. So the 5 in the input causes a 1 in the output in the same row. In Example 2, the input has a 5 in the third row, and the output has a 5 in the third column. Wait, that doesn't fit the previous pattern.\n\nWait, no, in Example 2, the input has a 5 in the third row, but the output has a 5 in the third column. So the position changes. That suggests that the rule isn't based on the row or column of the input 5.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output grid is a result of applying a certain transformation to the input grid, such as taking the maximum value in certain regions or something similar.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again, the output grid has 1s in the third row, which is where the input had a 5. So perhaps the rule is that any cell in the output grid that is in the same row and column as the input 5 becomes a 1. But in Example 2, the 5 is in the third row, and the output has a 1 in the third column, which doesn't fit the same rule.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has a 1 in the third column, but the input has a 5 in the third row. Maybe the rule is that the output grid has 1s in the same row and column as the input 5. So in the first example, only the third row has 1s, which matches. In the second example, the output has a 1 in the third column, but the input has a 5 in the third row, so the rule might be that if the input has a 5 in a particular row and column, the output grid will have 1s in those positions. But that doesn't seem to match because in the first output grid, the third row is all 0s except for the 1, which suggests that it's the same row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output grid has 1s where the input grid has any 5 or 8, but that seems too broad and doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output grid is a binary grid where each cell is 1 if the corresponding cell in the input grid has a 5 or 8 in any of the 3x3 regions around it. But looking at Example 1, the output grid has 1s in the third row, which might correspond to the 5 in the input. However, in the second example, the 5 is in the third row, and the output grid has 1s in different positions, which doesn't align with this idea.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output grids. For example, in the first output grid, the 1s are in the third row, which is the same row as the 5 in the input. In the second output grid, the 1 is in the middle row, which is the same as the position of the 5 in the input. Wait, in the second output grid, the 5 is in the middle row, but the output has a 1 in the middle column, not row. That contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each cell in the output grid, it is 1 if the input grid has a 5 or 8 in the same position or in any of the surrounding cells. But that seems too vague and not specific enough.\n\nWait, looking at the third example, the output grid has a 5 in the first and fourth rows. The input has a 5 in the first row. So maybe the rule is that any cell in the output grid that is in the first or fourth row becomes a 1 if the input has a 5 in those rows. But that's just a guess.\n\nI think I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to find a specific rule based on the examples. Let's consider each example separately.\n\nIn Example 1, the output grid has 1s in the third row, which is where the input had a 5. The rest of the grid is 0s except for the 5 in the input. So the rule seems to be that any cell in the output grid that is in the same row and column as the 5 in the input becomes a 1.\n\nIn Example 2, the output grid has a 1 in the third column. The input has a 5 in the third row. So if the rule is that any cell in the output grid that is in the same row or column as the 5 in the input becomes a 1, that would fit. Because in the output, the 1 is in the third column, which is the same as the 5 in the input's row.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output grid has 1s in other positions as well, so that can't be the rule. So maybe the rule is more specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell in the output grid that is in the same row or column as a 5 or 8 in the input becomes a 1. But again, in Example 2, the 5 is in the third row, and the output has a 1 in the third column, which fits. So maybe the rule is that any cell in the output that is in the same row or column as a 5 or 8 in the input becomes a 1, but other cells remain 0.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output grid has 1s only in the third row, which is the same row as the 5 in the input. So that fits. In the second example, the output grid has 1s in the third row (same as the 5 in the input's row), and also in the first and fourth rows. So that might suggest that the rule is that cells in the same row and column as any 5 or 8 become 1s.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the output grid has 1s in the third row, which is the same as the 5's position. In the second example, the 5 is in the third row, and the output has 1s in the third column, which is the same column. So maybe the rule is that any cell in the output that is in the same row or column as any 5 or 8 in the input becomes a 1, but other cells remain 0.\n\nBut looking at the third example, the output grid has 5s in the corners, which might correspond to the 5s in the input's corners. So perhaps the rule is that cells in the output grid that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 8 in the input become 1s.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nThe rule could be: for each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the input grid is a 5 or 8 in any of the 3x3 regions around it, then the output cell is 1; otherwise, it's 0. But this seems too broad and might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be based on the presence of 5s and 8s in certain positions. For example, if a cell in the output grid is in the same position as any 5 or 8 in the input, it becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 0.\n\nBut in the first example, the 5 is in the third row, and the output has 1s only in the third row, which fits. In the second example, the 5 is in the third row, and the output has 1s in the third column, which fits the same rule. In the third example, the 5 is in the first and fourth rows, and the output has 1s in those rows, which again fits.\n\nSo the rule seems to be that any cell in the output grid that is in the same row or column as a 5 or 8 in the input becomes a 1, and all other cells remain 0.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output grid has 1s only in the third row, which is where the 5 is. So that fits. In the second example, the 5 is in the third row, and the output has 1s in the third column, which is the same as the 5's position. So that also fits. In the third example, the 5s are in the first and fourth rows, and the output has 1s in those rows, which fits.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule is: for each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the input grid is a 5 or 8 in any of the 3x3 regions around it, then the output cell is 1; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate because the 5 in the first example is in the third row, and the output has 1s only in that row, not in the columns. So perhaps the rule is that any cell in the output grid that is in the same row or column as a 5 or 8 in the input becomes a 1, but that's not exactly how it works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output grid is a binary representation where each cell is 1 if the corresponding cell in the input grid has a 5 or 8 in any of the 3x3 regions around it, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe another approach is to look at the examples and see if there's a consistent transformation applied to each cell.\n\nIn the first example, the output grid has 1s in the third row, which is where the 5 is. The rest are 0s. In the second example, the 5 is in the third row, and the output has a 1 in the third column. In the third example, the 5s are in the first and fourth rows, and the output has 1s in those rows.\n\nSo the rule seems to be that for each cell in the output grid, if there's a 5 or 8 in any of the 3x3 regions that include this cell in the input grid, then the output cell is 1; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nBut to confirm, let's consider the third example. The input has 5s in the first and fourth rows. The output also has 1s in the first and fourth rows, which aligns with the rule.\n\nAnother point to check is the first example's output grid. The 1s are in the third row, which matches the position of the 5 in the input. The 0s elsewhere indicate that the rest of the cells are not affected by the 5.\n\nSo, based on this, the rule is: for each cell in the output grid, if there's a 5 or 8 in any of the 3x3 regions (i.e., the positions around it in the input grid) that includes this cell, then the output cell is 1; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the 5 is in the third row, and the output has 1s in that row, which corresponds to the 5 being in the third row. So the rule is that any cell in the output that is in the same row or column as a 5 or 8 in the input becomes 1.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the 5 is in the third row, and the output has a 1 in the third column. So the rule might be that any cell in the output that is in the same column as a 5 in the input becomes 1, or maybe it's more complex.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. The most accurate rule, based on the examples, is that the output grid is a binary grid where each cell is 1 if the corresponding cell in the input grid has a 5 or 8 in any of the 3x3 regions around it, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think about the first example. The 5 is in the third row, and the output has 1s in the same row. The 8 in the input is in the first row, but the output has 0s in the first row, which suggests it's not related to those cells.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for any cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the input grid is a 5 or 8 in any of the ", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 5 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 5 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 5 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully examining the examples to see if I can spot any patterns or similarities between the input and output.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a grid with mostly zeros and a couple of higher numbers, and the output seems to have some non-zero entries where the input had zeros, but the exact pattern isn't immediately clear. The second example has a similar structure but with some zeros replaced by different numbers, like 5 and 8. The third example is a bit different, with some non-zero values in the input that might correspond to higher numbers in the output.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a common operation that transforms the input into the output. For example, subtraction, addition, multiplication, or bitwise operations might be involved. Let me try to see if there's a consistent transformation.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 5 and a 1 in the fifth row, and in the output, those positions are replaced. I notice that in the output, the 5 becomes a 0, which suggests that maybe subtraction is happening, but I need to check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, where the input has a 5 in the sixth row and the output also has a 5. That supports the idea that 5 might be a key value. Also, the input has 8s, and the output has 4s there. Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe there's a division by 2 happening here.\n\nWait, let me check another example. In Example 2, the input also has an 8, and in the output, it's replaced with a 4. That fits with the idea of dividing by 2. Let me see if this holds across all examples.\n\nIn the first example, the 5 in the input is replaced with a 0 in the output. If I subtract 5 from 5, that gives 0, which matches. What about the 8s? In Example 2, the 8 in the input is replaced with a 0, but wait, no, in Example 2, the output has 4s instead of 8s. Wait, no, in Example 2, the input has an 8 in the fifth row, but the output has a 4, so maybe it's division by 2.\n\nWait, let me check Example 1 again. The output in Example 1, the fifth row, has a 0 where the input had a 5. So maybe it's 5 being transformed into 0, which could mean subtracting 5, but in other places, for example, the input had a 8, and the output had a 4, which is also 8 divided by 2.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that every non-zero number in the input is divided by 2, and zeros remain zero. But wait, in Example 1, the output has some zeros that were not in the input, like the last row where the output has a 5, which the input didn't have. So maybe the rule is that zeros remain zero, and non-zero numbers are divided by 2, but if the result is not zero, it's kept. For example, 5 becomes 2.5, but in the output, 5 is replaced by 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input and output both have 8s replaced with 4s. So maybe the rule is to divide by 2, and if the result is an integer, it's kept; otherwise, it's zero. Wait, but 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, which might be zero in the output. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 5 in the sixth row, and the output has a 0. So perhaps if the number is 5 or more, it gets divided by 2 and becomes 2 or less, but in the output, zeros are kept for numbers less than 5. Wait, but in Example 2, the input has an 8, which is divided by 2 to become 4, and the output has 4. But in the first example, the 5 becomes 0, not 2.5. So maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any number greater than or equal to 5 is divided by 2, and zeros remain zero. That would explain why in Example 1, the 5 becomes 0, and in Example 2, the 8 becomes 4. But then, what about the 5 in the output in Example 3? Wait, in Example 3, the input has a 5, and the output has a 0 as well, which fits. The 8 in Example 3 becomes 4 in the output, which also fits this rule.\n\nWait, but let's check another part. In Example 1, the input has a 5 in the fifth row, and the output has a 0. If the rule is to divide by 2, 5 becomes 2.5, which would be zero in the output, which fits. The 8 in the fifth row is in the output, but wait, no, looking back, the output in Example 1 has a 0 in the fifth row where the input had a 5, but what about the 8 row? The input in Example 1 has an 8 in the sixth row, and the output also has an 8 in the sixth row. So that's not consistent with the rule of dividing by 2.\n\nWait, that means my earlier assumption is incorrect. So perhaps the rule is more complex. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 5 in the sixth row, and the output also has a 0. The input in the sixth row is 5, and the output is 0. The input in the seventh row is 8, and the output is 0 as well. Hmm, that doesn't fit the dividing by 2 idea.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of 1s in the binary representation. Let's see. For example, 5 in binary is 101, which has two 1s. Maybe the rule is that if a cell has an odd number of 1s, it's replaced with 0, but that doesn't seem to fit because 8 in binary is 1000, which has one 1, and if the rule is even, then it's 0. But in Example 2, the input has an 8, which becomes a 0 in the output where the input had a 4, so that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is based on the sum of the digits in the row or column. For example, in Example 1, the sum of the fifth row is 5, and in the output, some cells are 0. That doesn't seem to hold.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the number of non-zero elements. Let's see. The fifth row in Example 1 has a single non-zero (5), and in the output, it's 0. The sixth row has two non-zero (8 and 8), and the output also has 8s. That doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the rule is that any number greater than or equal to 5 is replaced by 0, and the rest are left as is. But in Example 3, the input has a 5 and a 4, and the output has a 0 and 4, respectively. That fits. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 5 and some 8s. The output replaces 5 with 0 and 8 with 0. But in Example 1, the output also has 0s where the input had 5, and some 0s where the input had 8, but in the output, the 8s are still present. Wait, but that's inconsistent because in Example 1, the output has 0s where the input had 5, but the 8s remain 8. So that can't be the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for a different approach. Maybe the rule is that any cell in the output is 0 if the corresponding cell in the input is greater than or equal to 5, else it remains the same. But in Example 1, the 5 becomes 0, which fits. In Example 3, the 5 becomes 0, which fits. But let's check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has an 8, which is greater than 5, so it should become 0 in the output. But in the output, the 8 remains as 8. So that contradicts the rule. So that can't be the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell in the output is 0 if the input cell is greater than or equal to 5, and for cells less than 5, it remains the same. But as I just saw, in Example 2, the 8 remains 8, which contradicts this rule.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is different. Let me think about the numbers again. Maybe it's the opposite: if the input is less than 5, it remains as is; otherwise, it becomes 0. But that doesn't fit Example 3, where the 5 becomes 0, which fits. But let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 becomes 0; 8 becomes 0, which fits. In Example 2, the 8 becomes 0; but the output in Example 2 has an 8 in some positions, which doesn't fit. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell with more than one non-zero digit is replaced by 0. Let's test this. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has a single non-zero (5), so it remains 5. The sixth row has two non-zeros (8 and 8), so it becomes 0. But in Example 1, the output has 0 in the sixth row where the input had 8. That fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the fifth row in the input has an 8, which has one non-zero digit, so it remains 8. The sixth row has an 8, which has one non-zero, so it remains 8. But the output in Example 2 has 4 in the sixth row where the input had 8, which doesn't fit. So that's not the rule.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me look at the first example and see if I can find a pattern. The input has a 5 in the fifth row, which in the output is 0. So perhaps the rule is that if a cell has a value greater than or equal to 5, it's replaced by 0. But in Example 2, the 8 remains 8, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any cell with a value greater than or equal to 5 is divided by 2, but if the result is still greater than or equal to 5, it's divided again, and so on until it becomes less than 5. Let's test this.\n\nFor example, 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, which is less than 5, so it remains. 8 divided by 2 is 4, which is less than 5, so it remains. 6 divided by 2 is 3, which is less than 5, so it remains. 7 divided by 2 is 3.5, which is still less than 5, so it remains. 9 divided by 2 is 4.5, also less than 5. So in that case, the rule would be that any non-zero value is divided by 2, and if the result is still non-zero, it's divided again until it's less than 5. But the examples don't show any division beyond two steps, so this might not be it.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the rule is that any cell with a value greater than or equal to 5 is replaced by 0, and the rest remain the same. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row has a 5, which becomes 0. The sixth row has two 8s, which remain 8. The seventh row has an 8, which remains 8. The rest of the rows have 0s, which remain 0. This fits the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the fifth row has an 8, which remains 8. The sixth row has an 8, which remains 8. The seventh row has an 8, which remains 8. The rest are 0s, which remain 0. So this fits the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the fifth row has a 5, which becomes 0. The sixth row has an 8, which remains 8. The seventh row has an 8, which remains 8. The rest are 0s, which remain 0. This fits the output.\n\nWait, but what about the sixth row in Example 3? The input has an 8 in the seventh row, but the output in the seventh row has a 0, which fits the rule because 8 is greater than or equal to 5, so it's replaced by 0.\n\nSo this seems consistent across all examples. Therefore, the rule is: any cell with a value greater than or equal to 5 is replaced by 0; otherwise, it remains the same.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure. Looking at Example 2, the input has an 8 in the sixth row, which is replaced by 0 in the output. Wait, no, in Example 2, the sixth row has a 5, which is replaced by 0. Wait, no, in Example 2, the input has a 5 in the sixth row, so according to the rule, it would be replaced by 0. Let me check the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the sixth row's output is 0, which matches the rule. The seventh row in Example 2 has a 8, which according to the rule, should be replaced by 0. Let me see if that's the case in the output. Yes, the seventh row in the output has a 0. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in the output of Example 2, the seventh row is 0. So that's consistent with the rule.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the sixth row has two 8s, which according to the rule, should be replaced by 0. But in the output, the sixth row has 0s. Wait, no, the output in Example 1 has 0s in the sixth row where the input had 8s, so that fits.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the sixth row in the output is 0, which matches the rule. The seventh row in the input has an 8, which according to the rule, should be replaced by 0. In the output, the seventh row has a 0. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the sixth row of the first example, the output is 0, which matches the rule. The seventh row in the output has a 0, which matches the rule.\n\nSo, it seems that the rule is: any cell in the input grid that has a value of 5 or higher is set to 0 in the output grid, and all other cells retain their original values.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that for each cell, if the input value is greater than or equal to 5, the output cell is 0; otherwise, it remains unchanged.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 5 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 5 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 5 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, we have three examples where the input grids are transformed into output grids through some rule. Let me analyze each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLooking at this, I notice that in the first few rows, when there's a 5, it's propagating to the next row as 1s, but when it's a 0, it's propagating to the next as 0s. Maybe the rule is that if any cell in a row is a 5, all the cells in the row below it become 1s, unless they're already 1s. Wait, but in the output, the 5 remains as 5, and the 1s become 1s as well. Let me see the second example.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput line: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nAnother line in output is 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Hmm, so it seems that 5s are being transformed into 5s again, and other values are being reduced.\n\nLooking back at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nSame as input.\n\nWait, so in Example 3, the output is the same as the input. That suggests that the rule for this example is that no transformation occurs because the output is identical. Therefore, the rule might involve that 5s are preserved, but other values are reduced or left as is. However, looking at the first few rows, the 5s aren't being transformed, but the other numbers are being reduced.\n\nWait, maybe in the first example, when a cell is 5 in the input, the corresponding cell in the output is 1. Let me check. In the first output line, the fifth row has 5, and in the output it's 1. Similarly, in the second output line, there's a 5, and the output is 1. So that's a possible pattern: if a cell is 5, the output is 1; otherwise, it remains the same or is reduced.\n\nBut in Example 3, the output is the same as the input, which doesn't fit that pattern. So perhaps the rule is different. Maybe when a cell is 5, it propagates to the row below as 1s, but if it's 1, it becomes 1, but 5 remains 5. Let me see.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has a 5 in the first line, which is the same as the input. So perhaps that's not the case. Hmm, maybe the rule is that 5s in the input become 1s in the output, and other values remain the same. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the fifth row has a 5 in the input, and the output is 1. Similarly, in the second example, the fifth row in the output has a 5, which matches the input. The third row in the output has 5, which matches the input. So this seems consistent.\n\nSo the rule could be: any cell with a value of 5 in the input becomes 1 in the output, and other cells remain the same. But wait, in the first example, let's look at the first few lines:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input, the fifth line has a 1, and the output is 0. The sixth line in input has a 1, and output is 0. The seventh line in input has a 1, and output is 0. Then, the eighth line in input has a 5, and the output is 5. Wait, but the rule I thought of earlier only changes 5s to 1s. So perhaps the rule is that if a cell is 5, it becomes 1. Other cells are preserved. But let's check.\n\nIn the first example's output, the fifth line has a 1, which is the same as the input. The sixth line has a 0, which is the same as the input. The seventh line has a 0. The eighth line in input has a 0, which becomes 0. The ninth line in input has a 0, which becomes 0. The tenth line in input has a 0, which becomes 0. The eleventh line in input has a 0, which becomes 0. The twelfth line in input has a 0, remains 0. The thirteenth line in input has a 0, remains 0. The fourteenth line in input has a 0, remains 0. The fifteenth line in input has a 0, remains 0.\n\nSo, only the fifth line in input has a 1, which becomes 0 in output. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought. So maybe the rule is: if a cell is 5, it remains 5, else it's set to 0.

There are two examples provided, and I need to figure out what the rule is so I can apply it to the given test input grid.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids are quite similar except for some values. For instance, in the first row, the output has more 0s and fewer 5s compared to the input. Similarly, in Example 2, the output grid has zeros in more places where the input had non-zero values. In Example 3, again, the output has a lot of zeros where the input had non-zeros, except for a few 5s in specific positions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the examples. Let me take a closer look. For Example 1, the input has a row with multiple 0s except for a single 5 in the middle. The output for that same row is a row with mostly 0s except for some 5s at the ends. So maybe the rule is that any row containing a 5 in the input will have a corresponding row in the output with 5s at the ends.\n\nBut looking at the output in Example 1, the first row of output is all zeros except for the last two elements, which are 5s. The next rows seem to have a pattern where non-zero elements are at the ends. For example, the second row in the output has 1s at the beginning and end, and 0s in the middle.\n\nThis makes me think that the rule might involve keeping the non-zero elements at the borders and zeros in between. So, for any row in the input that has a 5, the corresponding row in the output would have 5s at both ends, and zeros in between. For other rows, especially those filled with zeros, the output would be zeros as well.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row is all zeros, and the output shows zeros in the second row as well. The second row has a 5 at the beginning and zeros elsewhere. The third row in the output has 3s at the ends and zeros in between. This again suggests that non-zero elements are at the ends.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row is all zeros, the second row has a 5, and the output has 5s at the ends. The third row in the output has 4s at the ends and zeros in between. So the same pattern holds here.\n\nSo putting this together, the rule is: For each row in the input grid, if the row contains a 5, then the corresponding row in the output grid will have 5s at both ends (the first and last elements) and zeros in between. If a row doesn't contain a 5, then the output row remains zeros.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid provided:\n\nThe input is a grid where the first row has a single 5 in the middle. The second row has a 5 at the end. The third row in the input is all zeros except for a 5 at the middle. The fourth row has a 5 at the end. So, based on the rule, the corresponding output rows should have 5s at the ends and zeros in between.\n\nLet me reconstruct the output grid accordingly. The first row will have 5s at the start and end. The second row has 5 at the end. The third row will have 5s at the middle and end, but wait, no\u2014it's a 15-element row. So, first element is 5, the last is 5, and the rest are zeros. Similarly, the fourth row has a 5 at the end, so it will have 5 at the start and end, and zeros in between. Wait, but looking back at Example 1, the output had 5s at the ends, not in the middle. So perhaps the rule is to have 5s at the ends regardless of the input.\n\nSo, for any row in the input that has a 5 anywhere, the corresponding output row will have 5s at both ends and zeros in between. For rows without any 5s, the output will be all zeros.\n\nApplying this:\n\nFirst row of input has a 5 in the middle. So the output first row will have 5s at the start and end, and zeros in between.\n\nSecond row of input has a 5 at the end. So the output second row will have 5 at the start and end.\n\nThird row of input is all zeros. So the output third row is all zeros.\n\nFourth row of input has a 5 at the end. Output row has 5s at start and end.\n\nFifth row in input is all zeros, so output row is zeros.\n\nSixth row in input has a 5 at the middle. So output row has 5s at the start and end.\n\nSeventh row in input has a 5 at the middle. Output row has 5s at the start and end.\n\nEighth row has a 5 at the end. Output row has 5s at start and end.\n\nNinth row has a 5 at the middle. Output row has 5s at start and end.\n\nTenth row has no 5s and is all zeros.\n\nEleventh row has a 5 at the middle. Output row has 5s at start and end.\n\nTwelfth row is all zeros.\n\nThirteenth row has a 5 at the middle. Output row has 5s at start and end.\n\nFourteenth row has a 5 at the end. Output row has 5s at start and end.\n\nFifteenth row is all zeros.\n\nSo, reconstructing the output, each row will start and end with 5, and have zeros in between where the input had non-zero values. For rows without 5s, the output is all zeros.\n\nThat makes sense with the given examples, so I think this is the rule.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 5 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 5 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 5 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth element is 0 in the output, but in the input it was 5. That suggests that the rule might involve some kind of transformation where the 5 is being converted to 0, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a row where the fifth element is 5 and the sixth is 8, 8, 8. The output for that row has 0 in the fifth position and 3s in the sixth position, but then the seventh to tenth positions are 0 again. This seems like a different transformation than Example 1. Maybe the rule changes depending on the input values.\n\nExample 3 shows more complex patterns. The input has a row with a 4 in the fifth and sixth positions, and the output has 4s in those positions, but also other elements like 1s and 4s. It seems like the rule might involve replacing certain values with others based on some condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about converting 5s into 0s and other values into 0s as well. Let me check Example 2 again. In Example 2's input, the fifth row has the second element as 5, and in the output, it's 0. Also, the second element in the sixth row is 5, and in the output, it's 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit a simple replacement rule.\n\nAnother approach is to look for patterns in the output based on the input. For instance, in Example 2's output, the second row's elements are all 0 except the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth positions. The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth elements in the output are 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3. Wait, no, looking again, the output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, so all zeros. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 5 in the input is replaced with 0 in the output, and other numbers are left as they are. Let's test that against Example 1. In Example 1's input, the fifth row has a 5 in the sixth position. If the rule is to replace 5s with 0s, then the sixth element in the output should be 0, which matches the example. Similarly, in Example 2's input, the fifth row has a 5 in the second position, and the output for that row has a 0 in the second position, which also aligns with the rule.\n\nLet's test this rule against Example 3. The third row in Example 3's input has a 4 in the fifth and sixth columns. According to the rule, those should become 0. But in the output, the fifth and sixth elements are 4, not 0. So that contradicts the rule. Therefore, the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different. Let me look again at Example 3's output for the fifth row. The output is 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0. Wait, that doesn't fit the rule I thought of before.\n\nMaybe the rule involves some sort of averaging or transformation of the surrounding elements. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is about the number of non-zero elements in a certain region. Or maybe it's based on the presence of certain values.\n\nWait, another thought: the output seems to be a transformation where certain patterns are replaced. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's sixth element becomes 0, but elsewhere, it remains as 0. Maybe the rule is that if a 5 is present, it's converted to 0, and other values are left as is. But in Example 3, the fifth row has a 4, which in the output remains as 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 5 is replaced with 0, but other numbers are replaced based on some other condition. For example, if a number is non-zero, it's replaced with the sum of its digits or something. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the sixth element is 5, which would be replaced with 5's digit sum, which is 5. But in the output, it's 0, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 5s are replaced with 0, and other numbers are replaced with 0 if they are 0, and some other value if they are non-zero. But again, in Example 3, the fifth row has a 4, which in the output remains as 4, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is more involved. Let me think: maybe the rule is that any 5 is replaced with 0, but non-5 values are replaced with 0 only if they are zero. Otherwise, they remain as they are. But in Example 1, the fifth row's sixth element is 5, which is replaced with 0, but other elements remain as they are. That aligns with Example 1's output.\n\nLet's test this against Example 2. In Example 2's input, the fifth row has a 5 in the second position. According to the rule, it should be replaced with 0. Looking at the output for that row, the second element is indeed 0, which matches. The sixth element in the output is 3, but according to the rule, since it's non-zero, it should remain as it is. But in the output, it's 3, so that's consistent. Similarly, the seventh to tenth elements are 0, which matches the rule.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's output, the fifth row's fifth element is 4, which should remain as is according to the rule. Looking at the output, the fifth element is indeed 4, so that aligns. The sixth element is also 4, which in the input is 4, so it remains as 4. The seventh to tenth elements are 0, which also aligns.\n\nBut let's check Example 3's fifth row more carefully. The input's fifth row has elements: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, no, looking back, the input for Example 3's fifth row is all zeros. So the output should be all zeros, which it is.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the fifth row's sixth element is 5, which is replaced with 0. In Example 2, the fifth row's second element is 5, replaced with 0. So the rule seems to be: any 5 in the input is replaced with 0 in the output. Other numbers are left as is.\n\nLet me test this with Example 3. The fifth row has elements that are all zeros, so the output is all zeros, which fits. The sixth row has a 5 in the second element, which should be replaced with 0. Looking at the output for that row, the second element is indeed 0, so that matches.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's output, the second element of the sixth row is 0, which is correct. Similarly, the second element of the seventh row is 0, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2's output, the second row's sixth element is 0, which is correct. The second element is 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's sixth row, the second element is 0, which is correct. The second element of the seventh row is 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another part. For example, in Example 2's sixth row, the last few elements are 8, 8, 8. In the input, those are zeros except for the last element, which is 8. According to the rule, 5 is replaced with 0, so 8 remains as 8. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which aligns with this.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's output, the sixth row is all zeros except for the sixth element being 3. Wait no, in the output of Example 2, the sixth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So in the input, the sixth row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So the fifth element is 0, sixth is 5, which according to the rule, should be replaced with 0. So the output should have 0 in the fifth and sixth positions. But the output shows 0 in the fifth and sixth positions, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's output, the sixth row is all zeros. So in the input, the sixth row's sixth element is 5, which is replaced with 0, and the others are 0, so the output is 0s. That fits.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3's output, the fifth row's fifth element is 4, which is non-zero, so according to the rule, it's left as is. The sixth row's second element is 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the sixth row of Example 3, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which suggests that any 5s are replaced with 0, and non-5s remain as is. So this seems to fit.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: in each row, any cell that contains the number 5 is replaced with 0. All other numbers remain unchanged.\n\nSo for the given input in Example 2, the fifth row has a 5 in the sixth position, which is replaced with 0. The sixth row has a 5 in the second position, which is replaced with 0. The seventh row has a 5 in the second position, which is replaced with 0.\n\nIn Example 3, the fifth row has all zeros, so nothing changes. The sixth row has a 5 in the second position, replaced with 0. The seventh row has a 5 in the second position, replaced with 0.\n\nWait, but in the sixth row of Example 2, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which suggests that any 5 in the input is replaced with 0. The input's sixth row has a 5 in the sixth position, so the output should be 0 in that position, and all others 0. So the output is correct.\n\nSo the rule is: for each row, any cell that is 5 is replaced with 0.\n\nThus, to create the output grid, we need to go through each row of the input grid and replace every occurrence of 5 with 0, leaving all other numbers unchanged.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the provided input grid in Example 2, the output should correctly replace the 5s with 0s where they are located.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the rule is: replace all 5s in each row with 0s.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 5 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 5 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 5 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by examining the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or inconsistencies.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has some zeros and a few 5s. The output grid seems to change these values in a particular way. For instance, the 5 in the top right corner becomes a 0, and the 0s around it become 0s except for some parts. Hmm, maybe there's a rule related to rows or columns being processed.\n\nIn Example 2, I notice that a 5 in the middle of a row transforms into a 0, and other elements change based on their positions relative to the 5. That suggests that the presence of a 5 might be a key factor in determining the output.\n\nNow, looking at Example 3, there's a 0 that changes into a 5. This is interesting because it shows that 5s can appear in the input and are transformed into other values in the output. So, maybe the rule involves converting certain values into 5s or altering 5s themselves.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the rule involves identifying specific positions or values in the input that get transformed into other values or remain the same. For example, in the input of Example 1, the 5 might be acting as a trigger, turning certain surrounding cells into 0s or other values.\n\nI think the rule might be that any cell with a 5 in its row or column is transformed into a 0, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the sum of the row or column, but that doesn't seem to fit perfectly either.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule involves the presence of a 5 in a specific pattern, such as a cross or a diagonal, which then triggers changes in the adjacent cells. This would make sense if, for example, the 5 in the center of a grid is a sentinel that affects its surrounding cells.\n\nLooking at the output grids, I see that certain regions have 0s and others have 5s or other numbers. This suggests that the output depends on where the 5s are in the input and how they interact with their neighboring cells.\n\nIn summary, after analyzing the examples, I'm starting to think that the rule involves checking for the presence of a 5 in specific positions (like the center or a particular row/column) and then applying transformations to surrounding cells based on that. The exact rule might include conditions on the number of 5s in a row or column, or perhaps how many 5s are present relative to other values.\n\nTo confirm this, I should look at specific examples where the 5s are in different positions and see how the output changes. For instance, in Example 1, the 5 in the top right corner of the first row turns into a 0, while in Example 2, the 5 in the middle of a row becomes a 0, and in Example 3, another 5 appears in a different position.\n\nThis suggests that the rule isn't just about individual 5s but about their positions relative to other values in the grid. For example, if a cell has a 5 in its row or column, it might be transformed into a 0, or maybe into a 5 if certain conditions are met.\n\nAnother observation is that in Example 2, the 5 in the middle of a row affects not just the middle cell but also some cells around it, leading to a 0 in the output. This indicates that the transformation isn't just a simple swap but involves a more complex interaction between cells.\n\nGiven these observations, I think the rule involves checking each cell to see if it's in the same row or column as a 5. If so, the cell is transformed based on its proximity to the 5, perhaps turning it into a 0 or another value. Alternatively, the 5 could be a trigger that affects all cells in its row or column, changing them in a specific way.\n\nTo implement this rule, I would need to iterate through each cell in the grid, check if it's in the same row or column as any 5, and then apply the appropriate transformation based on the number of 5s in that row or column. For example, if a row has three 5s, the adjacent cells might be transformed into 5s or 0s depending on the rule.\n\nLooking at the output grids, it seems that the 5s in the input are being transformed into 0s in certain areas, but not everywhere. This suggests that the presence of a 5 is not always replaced by a 0 but depends on the surrounding cells and the specific rule applied.\n\nOverall, the rule appears to involve a combination of checking for 5s in specific positions and applying transformations based on the number of 5s in the row or column. The exact details of how the transformation occurs, such as the number of 5s influencing the output values, need to be determined to fully understand the rule.\n</think>", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 5 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 5 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 5 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples provided might help me figure out what the rule is.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids are quite similar except for certain parts. For instance, in the input, there's a row with multiple 5s, and in the output, it seems like those 5s are converted to 1s. Then, other rows have zeros, and the output also zeros out some parts. It looks like the rule might be related to the number of non-zero elements in a row or column.\n\nIn Example 2, I notice that the output grid has some rows filled with 3s and 0s, especially in the rows where the input had 8s and 5s. This suggests that maybe the output is a transformation based on some kind of average or sum.\n\nExample 3 shows that the output grid has entries like 4, 5, and 1 based on the input grid. This indicates that the rule might involve some kind of scaling or modification of the original values.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems like the rule is to replace each non-zero element in the input with the number of non-zero elements in its row or column. For example, if a row in the input has three non-zero elements, the corresponding row in the output grid would have those same values replaced with 3s.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output grid had 1s in places where the input had 5s. That doesn't quite fit because if a row has three non-zero elements, it would be replaced with 3s, not 1s. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output grid is formed by taking the sum of each row in the input. For example, if a row in the input sums to 5, the corresponding row in the output would also sum to 5. But that doesn't match the examples either because the output isn't scaled; it's more about the structure.\n\nLooking again, in Example 1, the output grid has rows that are mostly zeros, except for the first one which has 0s and two 0s and then 0s. Wait, no, the first row of the output is all zeros. The second row has 0s except for the first element, which is 0, then the rest 0, except for the third, fourth, etc., which are 0s. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, actually, in the output of Example 1, the first row is all zeros, the second row has a 0, then maybe the third and fourth elements are zero, and then the rest are zero. That doesn't seem right. Maybe I should look at the specific numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each row in the output grid is a copy of the corresponding row in the input grid, but zeros are added where the input has zeros. That would make some rows look like they're unchanged, but in the examples, the output grid has a lot of zeros and some values.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output grid has a lot of zeros, except for certain rows where non-zero values are present. So maybe the rule is that the output grid is a row-wise transformation where each row is a copy of the input row, but with zeros inserted where the input had non-zero elements. Or maybe it's about the number of non-zero elements in each row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding row of the input grid. So for each row in the input, if there are, say, three non-zero elements, then the corresponding row in the output would have those elements as 3s.\n\nLooking back at Example 1, if a row in the input has three non-zero elements, the output would have those same elements replaced with 3s. But in the output, the first row is all zeros, which suggests that perhaps only the rows where the input had non-zero elements are transformed.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each element in the output grid is determined by the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding column of the input grid. So for each element in the output grid at position (i,j), it's replaced with the number of non-zero elements in column j of row i.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 1. In the input, the first row has 10 zeros and one 5, so column 1 has one non-zero element. Therefore, the first output row should have one 1 and the rest zeros. But in the output, the first row is all zeros, which contradicts this.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's the other way around. Perhaps the output is determined by the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding row, not the column.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of the input has one 5, which is non-zero. So the first output row would have one 1, followed by zeros. But the first row of the output is all zeros. That suggests that the output grid for the first row is all zeros, which might mean that the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is a transformation based on the sum of the elements in each row. For example, if a row in the input sums to 5, the output row sums to 5. But again, the output grid in Example 1 has a row that's all zeros, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of times that element appears in its row or column. But that seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to look for patterns in the output grid based on the input grid.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row with multiple zeros and a single 5. In the output, that row becomes a single 1 followed by zeros. The other rows in the output seem to be transformations of the input rows.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a row with multiple zeros except for an 8 and a 5. The output row has 0s except for 3s and a 4. So perhaps the rule is to replace each non-zero element with the count of non-zero elements in that row.\n\nWait, in the input of Example 2, the first row has two non-zero elements (8 and 5). So the output row should have 2s, but in the output, it's 0s except for 3s and a 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace each non-zero element with the sum of the row or column it's in. For example, if a row sums to 5, the output row has 5s where the input was non-zero.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output row that's all zeros suggests that the rule is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding row of the input grid. So, for each row in the input, the output row will have the same non-zero elements as the input, but the count replaces the original elements.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The first row of the input has one non-zero element (5), so the first output row should have one 1 and the rest zeros. But in the output, the first row is all zeros, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the elements in each row. For Example 1, the first row sums to 5, and in the output, the first row is all zeros. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of times that element appears in the corresponding column of the input grid. So for each element in the output grid, it's replaced by the count of non-zero elements in that column of the input.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has one non-zero element (5) in column 1. So the first output row should have one 1 and the rest zeros. But the output's first row is all zeros. That doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look for a different angle. Perhaps the rule is that the output grid is a transformation where each element is the number of times that element appears in its row or column, but that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of non-zero elements in the input's row and column at that position. So, for example, if the input has a 5 in a position, the output would be the count of non-zero elements in that row and column.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 1. In the input, the first row has one 5. The row in the output that corresponds to this would have one 1, followed by zeros. But in the output, the first row is all zeros, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the sum of the elements in the corresponding row and column of the input grid.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first element of the output grid is zero, which suggests that the sum is zero. But the input has a 5 in the first row, so this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding row of the input grid. So, if a row has three non-zero elements, the output row has three 3s.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row of the input has one non-zero element, so the output row should have one 1. But the output's first row is all zeros, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the count of non-zero elements in the input grid's row and column, but that seems too involved.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output grid is a transformation where each element is the number of times that element appears in the entire grid, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3, the output has values like 4, 5, 3, etc. Maybe the rule is that each element is the sum of the elements in its row or column, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the number of non-zero elements in the input's row and column divided by the total number of elements in the row and column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the output grid is a row-wise transformation where each element is the sum of the elements in the corresponding row of the input grid. For example, if a row in the input sums to 5, the output row sums to 5.\n\nBut looking at Example 1, the first row of the output is all zeros, which suggests that the rule isn't simply summing rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of times that element appears in its row and column across the entire grid. For example, if an element appears 2 times in its row and 3 times in its column, the output would have 5.\n\nBut that seems too complex and probably not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding row of the input grid. So, for example, if a row has 3 non-zero elements, the output row has 3 3s.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row of the input has one non-zero element, so the output row should have one 1. However, the output's first row is all zeros, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of non-zero elements in the input's column. For example, if a column has 3 non-zero elements, the output column has three 3s.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row of the output is all zeros, which suggests that the rule is different.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of a simpler rule. For instance, perhaps the output grid is a row-wise transformation where each element is the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding row of the input grid. But as I saw earlier, this doesn't fit Example 1.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the output grid is a row-wise transformation where each element is the sum of the elements in the corresponding column of the input grid. So, for each row, the output row is the sum of each element multiplied by the sum of the column.\n\nBut I don't see how that would work with the examples given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is a transformation where each element is the number of times that element appears in the entire grid, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the count of non-zero elements in the same cell as in the input grid, but that seems too similar to the identity function.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of non-zero elements in the row or column, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of times that element appears in the entire grid, but that seems too broad.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the sum of the elements in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. For example, if row i sums to R and column j sums to C, then the output grid's (i,j) element is R + C.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row sums to 5, and the first column also sums to 5. So the output's (1,1) element would be 5 + 5 = 10, but in the output, it's 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule is that each row in the output grid is a copy of the corresponding row in the input grid, but with zeros inserted where the input had non-zero elements.\n\nFor example, if the input row has three non-zero elements, the output row would have those same elements and then zeros to make the row length the same as the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the first row of the input has one non-zero element, so the output row should have one 1 and the rest zeros. But in the output, it's all zeros. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is a transformation where each element is the number of non-zero elements in the entire grid. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the output grid is constructed by replacing each non-zero element in the input grid with the number of times it appears in its row and column. So, for example, if an element appears k times in its row and m times in its column, it becomes k + m.\n\nBut again, without seeing the specific transformations, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 3, the output grid has some elements like 4, 5, and 1. For instance, the first element is 0, the second is 0, the third is 0, the fourth is 0, then 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the last element is 5, which is the same as the last row of the input, which had one 5 and some zeros. So perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the count of non-zero elements in the corresponding column of the input grid.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row of the input has a 0, so the first output row would have 0s. The second row has 0s as well, third row is 0s, fourth row is 0s, then the fifth row has a 5 which is the count of non-zero elements in its column. So the output row would have 5 in the fifth column and 0 elsewhere.\n\nThat makes sense. So the rule might be that each element in the output grid is the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding column of the input grid.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. If I look at the first column of the input, it has one non-zero element (5), so the corresponding output row should have 1 in the first column and 0 elsewhere. But in the output, the first row is all zeros, which suggests that the rule isn't simply the count of non-zero elements per column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the count of non-zero elements in the corresponding row of the input grid. So, for example, the first row of the output should have 1 in the first column because there's one non-zero element in the first row of the input.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output's first row is all zeros, which doesn't fit this rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the count of non-zero elements in the input grid, but that seems too broad and not specific to the rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the count of non-zero elements in the input grid's row and column. For example, if the input has a 5 in a position, the output would be the sum of non-zero elements in that row and column.\n\nBut that seems more complex and not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the number of times that element appears in the entire grid, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output grid is a row-wise transformation where each element is the sum of the input grid's row and column at that position. So, for example, if the input has a 5 in position (i,j), the output would be 5 if either the row or column has non-zero elements.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row of the output is all zeros, which suggests that the rule might be that the output row is the sum of the row and column, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output grid is the count of non-zero elements in the entire grid. But in Example 1, the input has 10 zeros and one 5, so the count would be 1, but the output row is all zeros.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress with this approach. Let me try to look for a pattern in Example 3 to see if it can help.\n\nIn Example 3, the output grid has elements like 4, 5, 1, 3, etc. Looking at the last row of the input, which has a 5 in position (9,9) and zeros elsewhere, the output row has a 5 at the last position and 0s elsewhere. So that seems to confirm the earlier idea that each element in the output grid is the count of non-zero elements in the corresponding column of the input.\n\nSo, in Example 3, the output grid's last row has 5 because that column has one non-zero element (the 5 at (9,9)). Similarly, the first output row has 0s except for 5 in the last column, which suggests that the column has one non-zero element.\n\nIn Example 1, if I follow this rule,", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 5 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 5 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 5 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me see the examples given to get a better idea.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids are quite similar, but there's a noticeable difference. In the input, there's a row with 5 and 0s, and in the output, the 5 becomes 1 and the 0s become 1s as well. Wait, no, looking closer, the output row after 5 has more 1s. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, in Example 1, the input has a row with 5 and 0s, and the output for that row shows a lot of 1s. That suggests that the input's 5 is somehow being converted into multiple 1s. But in the output of Example 1, the 5 becomes 1, but the trailing 0s become 0s. That doesn't seem to fit. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong part.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output's last row after the 5 is all 1s. So maybe the rule is that any 0 in the input becomes 1 in the output, but a 5 is treated as a special case where it also becomes 1. Or perhaps the 5 is replaced with 1, and the 0s are replaced with 1s, but the 1s in the output are more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is 1 if the corresponding cell in the input is 0 or 5, and 0 otherwise. But in Example 1, the input has a row with 5 and 0s. So according to this rule, the 5 becomes 1, and the 0 becomes 1, so the output should have all 1s in that row. But in Example 1's output, the last row is [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0], which isn't all 1s. So that can't be the rule.\n\nLet me look at Example 2. The input has some rows with 8s and 5s, and the output shows more 1s and some 3s. For example, in the last row of the input, there are 8s and 5s. In the output, the last row starts with 0, then 0, then 3s. So maybe the rule isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps each cell in the output is the sum of the input cells in the same row and column up to the minimum of their row and column indices. Or maybe it's based on some kind of max or min function.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3, the input has a row of 4s and 5s, and the output has 4s and some 0s. Maybe the rule is that any 0 in the input becomes 0, and any non-zero becomes the minimum of itself and a certain value, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output grid is the minimum of the input grid's row and column indices. But that doesn't fit because in the first example, the last row has a 5, which would correspond to row 5, but the minimum of 5 and 5 is 5, which is beyond the grid size, so maybe it's zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by whether the input cell is zero or five, but I'm not seeing it clearly.\n\nWait, another approach: let's look at the output grid in Example 1. It seems that any cell in the input that is 0 becomes 1, and any cell that is 5 becomes 1 as well. But in the output, it's not all 1s, so maybe it's more nuanced.\n\nWait, looking again: in Example 1, the input has a row with 5 and 0s. The output for that row is [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]. So the first two cells are 0, then six 1s, and the last two are 0s. That doesn't fit if any 0 or 5 becomes 1. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero cell becomes 1, but in the input, some cells are 0, and others are 5, which are also converted to 1. But in the output, the 0s that were 0 in the input are becoming 0 again, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any cell in the output is 1 if the corresponding cell in the input is non-zero, and 0 otherwise, but that doesn't fit because in the first example, the output is mostly 1s, which would match this, but the last row's trailing 0s are 0, which is correct. Wait, but in the first example, the last row in the input has 0s and a 5, and the output has 0s in the last two positions, which would correspond to the 0s in the input. So maybe the rule is that 0s in the input become 0s in the output, and non-zero cells become 1s.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output's last row is [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0], which has 1s, 0s, and 0s. That doesn't fit the rule that only non-zero cells become 1s.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the input cell's value and the cell above and to the left. So for each cell, if it's 0 or 5, it's set to 1. Otherwise, it's set to 0. But in Example 1, the last row in the output has some 1s and some 0s, which might align with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero cell becomes 1, and the output is a grid of 1s and 0s based on whether the input cell is non-zero. But in the first example, the last row has 0s and a 5, which would become 1s, so the output should have 1s in those positions. But in the output of Example 1, the last row has trailing 0s, which suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is more complex. Maybe it's based on the maximum value in the corresponding row or column. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1, the last row of the input has 0s and a 5. The output for that row is [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 5 becomes 1, and the 0s become 0 again. That matches the idea that if the input cell is 0 or 5, the output is 1, else 0. But then why in the output of Example 1, the last row's trailing 0s are 0s? Because the input's 0s are 0 in the output, so that fits.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the last row of the input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which fits the rule. So maybe the rule is that any cell in the output is 1 if the corresponding cell in the input is non-zero and not 5, else 0. But in the first example, the output has 1s for the non-zero 5s and 0s for the 0s, which fits.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the input has 8s and 5s, and the output has 3s and 0s. So perhaps the 8s are being converted into 3s, and the 5 remains as 1. Or maybe it's based on the sum or other operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the minimum of the input cell's value and 1, but that doesn't make sense because the output in Example 2 includes 3s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0 or 5, else 0. Let me test this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, input has a 5, so output is 1. The trailing 0s are 0 in the output, which matches. The other rows have 0s and 5s in the input, so their outputs have 1s where the input had 5s and 0s elsewhere.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s and 5s. If the rule is that 0 and 5 become 1, and others become 0, then the output should have 1s for the 5s and 0s for the 8s. But in Example 2's output, the 8s are being converted to 3s. So that suggests that the initial idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero cell in the input becomes 1, but the 5 is treated as 1 as well. So the rule is: output is 1 if input is 0 or 5, else 0. But in Example 2, the 8 becomes 3. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the maximum value between the input and a certain threshold. For example, any 0 or 5 becomes 1, and any other non-zero becomes 0. But in Example 2, the output has 3s, which suggests a different rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the input cell's value and the cell to the left and above. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the cells are 0s, so the output is 0s. In the second row, the 5 is the first cell, so it becomes 1, and the rest are 0s because they are either 0 or 5. But in the output of Example 1, the second row has 0s after the 5, which might not fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell's value in the input and the cell above and to the left. Let me try that.\n\nFor example, in the first row of Example 1, all are 0s, so the output is 0s. In the second row, the first cell is 0, so it's 0. The second cell is 0, so 0. The third cell is 0, so 0. Then the 5 is at the fourth cell, so it's 5. The rest are 0s because they're either 0 or 5. But in the output, the second row has 0s after the 5, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is the minimum of the cell to the right and below. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0 or 5, else 0. Let me test this with Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s and 5s. If the rule is that 0 and 5 become 1, and others become 0, then the output should have 1s for the 5s and 0s for the 8s. But in the output of Example 2, the 8s are converted to 3s, which doesn't fit this rule. So that suggests the initial idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0 or 5, else 0, except for 8s, which are converted to 3s. But that seems ad-hoc and not a general rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0 or 5, and 3 otherwise. But in Example 1, the 5 becomes 1, but the trailing 0s remain 0, which fits. In Example 2, the 8 becomes 3, and the 5 becomes 1, which fits. Let me see if this applies to other examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 4s and 5s. If the rule is 0 becomes 0, 5 becomes 1, 4 becomes 4, and 8 becomes 3, then the output should have 1s where input has 5 or 8, and 4s where input was 4, and 0s where input was 0.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, I see 1s in the first row where the input has 5s and 8s, and 4s where the input was 4s. So this seems to fit. Additionally, in the last row of Example 3, the input has 0s and 5s, so the output should have 0s and 1s, matching the output.\n\nSo putting this together, the rule seems to be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If the input cell is 0 or 5, set output to 1.\n- If the input cell is 8, set output to 3.\n- Otherwise (input is 4 or 6, etc.), output remains 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the last row has 0s and 5, so the output is 0s and 1s. So this fits with the rule.\n\nLet me test this rule against Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 5 in the second row, so output should have 1s there. The trailing 0s remain 0s. The output in Example 1 matches this.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s and 5s. So output should have 3s where input has 8s and 1s where input has 5s, and 0s elsewhere. But in the output of Example 2, the 8s are 3s and the 5s are 1s, so this fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 4s and 5s, so output has 4s where input was 4, 1s where input was 5, and 3s where input was 8. This matches the output.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\nEach cell in the output is set to 1 if the corresponding input cell is 0 or 5, and 3 if the input cell is 8. All other values (4, 6, etc.) are set to 0.\n\nLet me check the input and output for Example 2 again. The input has 8s which become 3s, and the 5s which become 1s. The 0s remain 0s. The trailing 0s in the output after the 5s remain 0s, which aligns with the rule.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that each cell in the output is 1 if the input cell is 0 or 5, 3 if the input cell is 8, and 0 otherwise.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the input provided in the test case.\n\nThe test input grid is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's process each cell:\n\nFor each row, each cell in the input is checked against the rule.\n\nRow 1: All zeros, so output is all zeros.\n\nRow 2: The 5 is at position (1,1) in the 2D array (assuming 0-based index), so output has 1 there, others are 0.\n\nRow 3: All zeros.\n\nRow 4: All zeros.\n\nRow 5: 0s except the 5 at position (4,1), which becomes 1.\n\nRow 6: 8s are at positions (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), and 5 at (5,6) which is 0 in input, but wait, no, in the input row, the 5 is at position (5,6), but in the output, the 5 is 0. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the position wrong.\n\nWait, in the test input, row 6 is [0,0,5,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So the 5 is at position (5,2) in 0-based indexing, and the 8s are at positions (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). So in the output, the 5 becomes 1, and the 8s become 3s.\n\nRow 7: 5 is at position (6,2), so output is 1 there, others 0.\n\nRow 8: All zeros.\n\nRow 9: All zeros.\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 5 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 5 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 5 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's start by carefully analyzing the examples step by step.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids are quite similar except for a few differences. For instance, in the first grid, there's a 5 at the position (2,5), and in the output, that position is also 5. Then, in the second grid, the 5 in the input becomes a 0 in the output. So it seems like the rule affects these positions based on their surroundings.\n\nMoving on to Example 2, I notice that the output grid has some changes that aren't just straightforward duplicates. For example, the position (row 1, column 4) has a 0 in the output where there was a 5, and other positions might have their values altered. This suggests that the rule isn't a simple identity mapping but perhaps involves some kind of transformation based on the values present.\n\nIn Example 3, the output grid shows that certain values are replaced with 4s or 0s. For example, the position where the input was 8 becomes 4, and the 0 in the input becomes 0 in the output. This indicates that the rule might be reducing certain values and modifying others based on specific conditions.\n\nPutting this together, I think the rule involves looking at the neighborhood around each cell and determining a new value based on the presence of certain numbers. Maybe it's a cell-based operation where each cell's value is replaced by the sum of its neighbors or some other function.\n\nLooking closer, in Example 1, the 5 in the input grid becomes a 5 in the output, but in the second grid, it becomes 0. That's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps the rule isn't about the presence of a 5 but about the values surrounding it.\n\nAnother angle: maybe each cell in the output is determined by the minimum or maximum of the surrounding cells. Or perhaps each cell is set to the count of a specific digit in its neighborhood.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the output has 4s where the input didn't have 0s. For instance, the position (row 5, column 5) in the input was 0, but in the output, it's still 0. But in another position, the input had 0, and the output had 0 as well. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves the sum of the digits in the binary representation of the cell's value. For example, if a cell has a value like 8, which is 1000 in binary, the sum of digits is 1. But in the output, it's 4, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is about the number of times a digit appears in the cell's neighborhood. For example, if the cell has a 0, it might count how many 0s are in its vicinity. But the output in Example 1 has a 5 in a position where the input had a 5, so that doesn't seem to align.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rule is based on the number of non-zero digits in the cell's neighborhood. For instance, if the input cell is 5, and the neighborhood has multiple non-zero digits, it might be set to 5 again. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern by comparing the input and output grids. Looking at the first grid in Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLooking at where the output differs from the input, in Example 1, the output has 0s where the input had 0s except for the 5, which remained 5. Also, some 0s turned into 1s or 5s.\n\nIn the second grid of Example 1, the output has 0s where the input had 0s except for the 5, which became 0. So, it's not a straightforward replacement but involves some transformation.\n\nNow, looking at Example 2, where the input has 8s and 5s, and the output has 0s where the input had 5s. For instance, in the second row, the output has 0s where the input was 5. Also, the 8s in the input become 0s, which might indicate that certain values are replaced based on their presence.\n\nIn Example 3, the 0s in the input become 0s, which is straightforward, but the 5s become 4s. That's interesting. So, the presence of a 5 is being reduced to 4 in the output.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the rule is that for each cell, if the cell's value in the input is greater than 0, we look at its neighborhood and count the number of 0s, replacing the cell with that count. Or perhaps it's the sum of the digits in the neighborhood.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has 0s where the input had 5s. So, perhaps when the input cell is 5, it's replaced by 0. But in other cases, it's changed to something else. For example, in the third row, the input has 0s, but the output has 0s where the input had non-zero values.\n\nWait, no, in Example 2, the output has 0s where the input was 5, and the 8s turned into 0s. That's more complicated.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is set to the sum of its neighboring cells' values. So, for each cell, look at the cells around it (like up, down, left, right, and diagonals in a 5x5 neighborhood), sum their values, and that sum becomes the new value.\n\nLet me test this idea with Example 1. Looking at the first row, the input has 0s except for a 5 in position (5,1). If I sum all the neighbors around that 5, including itself, what do I get? The sum of the 5 and its neighbors. For example, the 5 is in (5,1). Its neighbors would include the 0s around it, except for the top 0. Summing all these would give 0 or some other value. But in the output, the 5 remains 5, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the count of non-zero digits in the neighborhood. For example, if a cell has 0s except for a few non-zero digits, it would be replaced by the count of non-zero digits. But in Example 1, the 5 in the input remains 5, so that doesn't fit either.\n\nAnother possibility: the rule is that each cell's value is set to the number of 1s in its neighborhood. In Example 1, the 5 in a position where the neighborhood has a certain number of 1s would become 5 again, but that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the digits in the binary representation of the cell's value. For example, 5 in binary is 101, which sums to 1+0+1=2. But in the output, it's 5, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the change from the input to the output, perhaps each cell's value is being replaced by the average of its neighbors. Or some other statistical measure.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 5 in the input becomes 5 in the output, which suggests that it's unchanged. So that can't be the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is the sum of the digits in its neighborhood. For example, if a cell has a 5, the sum of its digits in the neighborhood would be 5, so it remains 5. If a cell has a 0, perhaps it's replaced by the sum of its neighbors' digits. But in the output, some cells still have 0s, so perhaps the rule isn't just the sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each cell's value is being replaced by the minimum of the cells in its neighborhood. Let's see: in Example 1, the 5 in a position where the neighborhood includes other 5s would remain 5. The 0s would remain 0. But in the output, some 0s turned into 1s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about the number of times a digit appears in the cell's neighborhood. For example, if a cell has a 5, and the neighborhood has more 5s, it might be replaced by the count. But in the output, it remains 5, so that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output grids, there's a lot of 0s. For example, in Example 2, the output has 0s in some positions where the input had non-zero values. So perhaps, when a cell's value is greater than 0, it's replaced by 0. But in Example 3, the 5s become 4s, not 0s.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the output has 4s where the input had 8s. So it's more about replacing higher numbers with lower ones. Maybe the rule is that each cell's value is reduced based on its value and the presence of certain digits.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is the count of non-zero digits in its neighborhood. For example, a cell with 5 would have 5 non-zero digits (if all neighbors in the neighborhood are non-zero), so it would remain 5. If a cell has 0, it would be replaced by the count of non-zero digits in its neighborhood.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 0s where the input had 0s except for 5s. So perhaps when a cell is 5, it's replaced by 5, but when it's 0, it's replaced by the count of non-zero digits.\n\nWait, let me test this idea with Example 1. The cell with 5 in the input has a neighborhood that includes other cells. If the sum of the non-zero digits in that neighborhood is 5, then it would remain 5. But if the sum is something else, it might change. However, in the output, it's still 5, so that suggests that the count is 5, which means the neighborhood has 5 non-zero digits.\n\nBut looking at the cell with 5 in the input (row 2, column 5), its neighborhood includes cells around it. If the sum of non-zero digits is 5, then it remains 5. But if the sum is different, it might be replaced. However, in the output, it's still 5, so perhaps the sum of non-zero digits in its neighborhood is 5, which means it stays 5.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 5 in the input becomes a 4. So, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is reduced based on its value. For example, if a cell is 5, it becomes 4. If it's 0, it remains 0. But that doesn't fit the 8 turning into 0 as in Example 1.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the 8 turns into 0, which suggests that 8 is being reduced to 0. So perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is set to 0 if it's greater than 0, and remains the same otherwise. But in Example 3, the 5 becomes 4, not 0, so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is set to 0 if it's 0, and to the sum of its neighbors' values otherwise. But in Example 1, the 5 remains 5, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is set to the sum of its neighbors' values. So, for each cell, look at its neighborhood, sum all the values, and that becomes the new value. Let's see if that works with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the cell with 5 in the input: its neighborhood would include other 5s, so the sum would be 5, so it remains 5. The cell with 0 would sum its neighbors to get its new value, but in the output, some cells are 0, so perhaps that's not the rule.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has 0s where the input had 0s, except for the 5, which remained 5. So, the rule might be that if the cell's value in the input is 5, it remains 5; if it's 0, it becomes 0. But then the 8 in the input would become 0 in the output, which is consistent. However, the 5 turning into 4 in Example 3 contradicts this.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has a 5 in some position, and the output has it as 4. So, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is reduced based on some condition. For example, if the cell's value is greater than 0, it's set to 0, but that doesn't fit because other cells become 0 as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is the sum of its neighbors plus 1. Let me test this with Example 1: the 5 in the input has a sum of neighbors that equals 5, so 5 + 0 = 5. The 8 would have a sum that equals 8, so 8 + 1 = 9, but in the output, it's 0, so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is the sum of its neighbors, and if the sum exceeds a certain threshold, it's set to 0. For example, if the sum is greater than 5, then it becomes 0.\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 in the input has a sum in its neighborhood that is 5, so it remains 5. The 0s have sums that are 0, so they remain 0. The 8 in the input might have a sum that's 8, which is greater than 5, so it becomes 0.\n\nIn Example 2, the 8 in the input would have a sum that's 8, which is greater than 5, so it becomes 0. The 5s in the input might have sums that are 5, so they remain 5, but in Example 3, the 5 becomes a 4, which contradicts this.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is the sum of its neighbors divided by the number of neighbors, and if the result is greater than 5, it's set to 0. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the cell with 5 has a sum of 5, divided by 4 (assuming four neighbors), so 5/4 = 1.25, which is less than 5, so it remains 5. The cell with 8 has a sum that's 8, divided by 8 (assuming eight neighbors), so 1, which is less than 5, so it becomes 0.\n\nIn Example 3, the cell with 5 has a sum of its neighbors that is 4 (if it had, say, three neighbors), divided by 3 is approximately 1.333, still less than 5, so it remains 5, which contradicts the test case where", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 5 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 5 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 5 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples provided and see if I can spot a pattern or a rule that applies consistently.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids have similar structures but with some differences. For instance, in the first row of the output, there are a lot of zeros except for a 0 in the first column, then some 0s, and then a 5. Wait, no, looking closer, the first row of output is all zeros except for the 5 in the second column. Wait, no, let me check the actual values.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first output line is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which seems to be all zeros. But the second line is [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has a 5 in the second position. Hmm, but the output seems to be all zeros, but I might be misunderstanding the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. In Example 1, the input is a grid that starts with all zeros except for the second row, which has a 5 in the middle. The output grid seems to have a 5 in the second position as well. But looking more closely, I see that the output grid in Example 1 has mostly zeros, except for a 5 in the second position. So maybe the rule is that any 5 in the input grid is replaced with a 5 in the output grid, but that doesn't explain the rest of the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input grid has a 0 in the first row, then a 5 in the second row, and some other numbers. The output grid has 0s, 5s, and some other numbers. It seems that the rule might involve replacing 0s with 0s, 5s with 5s, and other numbers with the sum of their adjacent cells or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 0 in the input grid becomes 0 in the output grid, any 5 becomes 5, and other numbers are transformed based on their neighboring numbers in the grid.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output grid has a 5 in the first position, but all others are zeros. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that any 5 in the input grid is replaced with a 5 in the output grid, and other numbers are transformed based on their own values.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output grid has 5s in the second, sixth, and last rows. The input grid has a 5 in the second row and the sixth row has a 5 as well. So maybe any 5 in the input grid is kept as a 5 in the output grid, and 0s are replaced with 0s.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3, the output grid has 5s in the second, sixth, and last rows, which matches the input grid's 5s. The rest of the 0s in the input grid are turned into 0s in the output. So perhaps the rule is that any 5 in the input grid remains a 5 in the output grid, and 0s become 0s, and other numbers are transformed into something else based on their own values.\n\nBut wait, in the examples, some other numbers are transformed as well. For instance, in Example 1, the output grid has a 5 in the second position, which was already a 5 in the input. But in the third row, the output has a 3, which was a 3 in the input. So maybe the rule is that any number greater than 5 is reduced to 5, and numbers less than 5 are kept as is.\n\nWait, let me check that against the examples. In Example 1, the input has a 5 in the second row, and the output has a 5 in the second row as well. The third row in the input has some 0s and a 5, but the output's third row has 3s and 0s. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is more complex. Let's think about the output grids. For example, in Example 1, the output grid has a 5 in the second row, but the first row is all zeros. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the examples more carefully. In Example 1, the input grid is such that only the second row has a 5, and the output grid also has a 5 in the second row, but other parts are zeros. Maybe the rule is that any 5 in the input grid is preserved as a 5 in the output, and all other cells are set to 0.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output grid has 5s in the second and sixth rows, which are also present in the input. So perhaps the rule is that any 5 in the input grid becomes a 5 in the output grid, and all other cells are set to 0.\n\nWait, let me check Example 3. The input grid has a 5 in the second row and a 5 in the last row. The output grid has 5s in the second and last rows. The other cells in the output grid are 3s or 0s, which might be the result of some transformation on other numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 5 in the input grid is converted to a 5 in the output grid, and all other cells are set to 0. That seems consistent across the examples. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 5 in the second row, and the output has a 5 in the second row as well. The rest of the cells are zeros, which makes sense. Similarly, in Example 2, the output has 5s in the second and sixth rows, which were already present in the input. The other cells in the output are 0 or 5, which might suggest that 5s remain as 5s and other numbers are set to 0.\n\nWait, but in the output grid of Example 1, the first row is all zeros, which might suggest that any 5 in the input grid would have been converted to a 5 in the output, but the others are 0. But in the input, the first row is all zeros, so the output's first row is all zeros. Wait, that might not fit unless the rule is that any 5 in the input grid becomes a 5 in the output, but other numbers are converted to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is: any cell in the output grid is 0 if the corresponding cell in the input grid is 0, and 5 if the corresponding cell in the input grid is 5. Other cells are determined based on some transformation.\n\nBut looking at Example 2, the output grid has 5s in the second and sixth rows, which were already 5s in the input. The other cells in the output are 0 or 3, which might suggest that 0s are kept as 0, 5s are kept as 5, and other numbers are transformed into 0 or 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell in the output grid is 0 if the corresponding cell in the input grid is 0, 5 if the corresponding cell in the input grid is 5, and the other cells are the sum of their adjacent cells. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the output grids and see if there's a pattern in how they are generated. For example, in Example 1, the output grid has 5s in certain positions, and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, in Example 2, the output grid has 5s in specific rows, but the other cells have values like 3 or 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 5 in the input grid is converted to a 5 in the output grid, and all other cells are set to 0. That would explain the examples, as in Example 1, the second row had a 5, and the output had a 5 in that row, while the rest were zeros. Similarly, in Example 2, the output grid has 5s in specific rows, which were present in the input.\n\nBut then, in the output grid of Example 3, the 5s in the input are preserved as 5s, but other cells have different values. So perhaps the rule is that any 5 in the input grid is converted to a 5 in the output grid, and other cells are set based on their own values or some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 0 in the input grid becomes 0 in the output, any 5 becomes 5, and other numbers are replaced with the sum of their adjacent cells.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let's see. For instance, in the first example, the input grid has a 5 in the second row, and the output grid has a 5 in the second row. The other 5 in the input grid might have been replaced with a 5 in the output grid. Similarly, other cells might have been replaced based on their neighbors.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output grid has mostly zeros, except for a 5 in the second position. That suggests that perhaps the rule is that any 5 in the input grid is converted to a 5 in the output grid, and all other cells are set to 0.\n\nBut then, in the output grid of Example 2, the 5s in the second and sixth rows would remain as 5s, while other cells would be 0 or 3, which might be the result of some transformation on other numbers.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the output grid has 5s in the second and last rows, which were present in the input. The other cells seem to be 3s or 0s, which might be the result of some transformation on other numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 5 in the input grid is converted to a 5 in the output grid, and other cells are set to 0 if they were 0, and some other transformation if they were other numbers.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should try to find a consistent rule by looking at the differences between the input and output grids.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 0 in the input grid becomes 0 in the output, any 5 becomes 5, and other numbers are kept as they are. But that doesn't fit the examples because, for example, in the input grid of Example 1, there are 5s and other numbers, but the output grid has 0s and 5s.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 5 in the input grid becomes a 5 in the output grid, and all other cells are set to 0. That would explain the examples. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1, the second row of the input has a 5, so the output's second row also has a 5. The rest of the cells in the output are 0, which matches the input's other cells being 0 except for the second row, which has a 5.\n\nIn Example 2, the output's second and sixth rows have 5s, which were already present in the input. The other cells in the output are 0 or 3, which might be the result of some transformation on other numbers.\n\nIn Example 3, the output's second and last rows have 5s, which were present in the input. The other cells seem to be 3s or 0s, which might be the result of some transformation on other numbers.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: any cell in the output grid is 0 if the corresponding cell in the input grid is 0, 5 if the corresponding cell in the input grid is 5, and for other cells, they are set to 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the input grid has some cells that are 0, but the output grid has 0s. So that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the input grid has some cells that are 0, but the output grid has 3s in some positions. That suggests that perhaps the rule is more complex, and it's not just based on the input grid's values.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look for a more generalized rule. Let's consider that each cell in the output grid is determined by some function of the corresponding cell in the input grid and possibly its neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 5 in the input grid is converted to a 5 in the output grid, and all other cells are set to 0. That seems to fit the examples, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me try to apply this rule to the examples. In Example 1, the second row of the input has a 5, so the output's second row also has a 5. The rest of the cells are 0s, which matches the input's other rows being all 0s except for the second row.\n\nIn Example 2, the second and sixth rows of the input have a 5, so the output's second and sixth rows also have 5s. The rest of the cells in the output are 0 or 3, which might correspond to some transformation on other numbers.\n\nIn Example 3, the second and last rows of the input have a 5, so the output's second and last rows also have 5s. The other cells in the output are 3s or 0s, which might correspond to some transformation on other numbers.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: any 5 in the input grid becomes a 5 in the output grid, and all other cells are set to 0.\n\nThat would explain the examples. So, applying this rule, the output grid would have 5s in the positions where the input grid had 5s, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. For example, in the last row of the input grid, there's a 0, so the output would have a 0. In the other rows, the 5s would remain as 5s.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Therefore, the rule is: any 5 in the input grid becomes a 5 in the output grid, and all other cells are set to 0.\n\nSo, for the test input grid provided, I need to apply this rule. Let's look at the test input grid:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- The first row is all zeros, so the output row will be all zeros.\n- The second row has a 5 in the 8th position, so the output will have a 5 in the 8th position.\n- The third row is all zeros, so the output will be all zeros.\n- The fourth row is all zeros, output all zeros.\n- The fifth row is all zeros, output all zeros.\n- The sixth row has 8s and a 5 in the 7th position. So the output will have 8s and a 5 in the 7th position.\n- The seventh row has a 5 in the 3rd position, so the output will have a 5 in the 3rd position.\n- The eighth row has a 5 in the 7th position, so the output will have a 5 in the 7th position.\n- The ninth row is all zeros, so output all zeros.\n- The tenth row has a 5 in the 11th position, so output will have a 5 there.\n- The eleventh row has 0s, so output all zeros.\n- The twelfth row is all zeros.\n- The thirteenth row has an 8 in the 6th position, so output will have an 8 there.\n\nWait, but the output grid in Example 1 is constructed by replacing the 5 in the second row with a 5, and the 5 in the seventh row with a 5, and the 5 in the ninth row with a 5, but in the test input grid, the fifth row has a 5 in the 11th position. So, in the output grid, the 11th position would be 5.\n\nLooking at the test input grid's 11th row:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n\nSo the 5 is in the 11th position. So in the output grid for this test input, the 11th position should be 5.\n\nSimilarly, the sixth row has a 5 in the 7th position, so the output's 7th position should be 5.\n\nSo, applying this rule, the output grid would be:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ", 0.0], ["25", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 5 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 5 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 5 0\n0 0 4 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 5 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, we're given an input grid and an output grid, and we need to find the rule that transforms the input to the output. Then, we apply that rule to a new input grid to get the expected output.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input and output have a lot of zeros, but there are a few non-zero entries. For instance, in the first output row, there's a 0 at position (5, 0) and a 1 at (5, 5). Similarly, in the second output row, there's a 0 at (0, 5) and a 2 at (1, 5). Hmm, that might indicate a rule where each non-zero cell in the output is determined by some calculation involving the surrounding cells in the input.\n\nWait, let's take a closer look. The input grids are 15x15. The output grids have some 0s and some positive integers. It seems like the rule might be related to counting certain patterns in the input that result in a non-zero value in the output.\n\nLooking at the second example, the output has some 5s and 3s in specific positions. For example, in the 5th output row, there's a 5 at (2, 5), and in the 4th row, a 3 at (3, 4). This suggests that the rule could involve some kind of counting or accumulation of values, perhaps related to diagonals or specific regions.\n\nIn the third example, the output grid also shows a mix of 0s and 5s. The last row has a 5 at (11, 10). This might indicate that the rule is more about the position of the non-zero values rather than their values themselves.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is non-zero if it's on the diagonal of the input grid. For example, (i, i) in the output corresponds to (i, i) in the input. But looking at the examples, that doesn't seem to fit because the non-zero entries in the output don't always align with the input's diagonals.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the rule involves the sum of certain diagonals. For instance, in the first example, the output has non-zero values at positions that are one step away from the main diagonal. So, maybe it's counting the number of steps or something similar along each diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the parity of the sum of indices or some other mathematical property. But without seeing a clear pattern, it's tricky.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the rule could involve the number of times a particular value appears in a diagonal. But again, without more data points, it's hard to be sure.\n\nWait, looking at the second example, the output has a 5 in the last position. In the input, the last row has a 5 in the first position. Maybe the rule is that if a diagonal cell in the input is 5, it results in a 5 in the output. But that doesn't explain the other 3s and 5s.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the sum of the two cells diagonally above it in the input, similar to how pixels are processed in some algorithms. But in that case, the outputs would be a convolution of the inputs, but the examples don't exactly match that.\n\nWait, in the first output row, the fifth entry is 1. In the input, the fifth row has a 1 at (5,5). The sixth row has a 0. Maybe the rule is to take the diagonal elements and sum them, but that doesn't fit the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the sum of the two cells diagonally above it, but if that sum is greater than zero, it's set to 1. But that would explain the 1 in the fifth row, but the other outputs like having 3s in certain positions don't fit.\n\nWait, looking at the third example, the output has a 5 only in the last row, first column. The input's last row has a 5 in the first column. Maybe the rule is that the non-zero output is 5 if and only if the corresponding input cell is 5. But again, the other examples don't fully align with this.\n\nPerhaps the rule is that the output cell is 5 if the input cell is 5 and it's on a certain diagonal, but I'm not sure. Without seeing the exact mapping of each cell, it's challenging.\n\nAnother angle is to look at how the non-zero values are positioned. In the first example, the non-zero in the output seems to be in the positions that are one step to the right and below the input's main diagonal. So, for example, if the input has a non-zero at (i,j), the output might have a non-zero at (j,i) or something similar.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) in the output is the sum of the input cells along the diagonal from (0,0) to (i,j). If that sum is positive, it's set to 1. But that might not explain the other outputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cell in the output is the maximum value of the two diagonally adjacent cells in the input. But again, without more data, it's hard to confirm.\n\nWait, let's consider the second example's output. It has a 5 in the last row, first column. The input's last row, first column is 0, but the sixth row's first column is 5. How does that lead to 5 in the output? Maybe the rule is that if a diagonal cell in the input is 5, the corresponding output is 5, regardless of its position.\n\nBut in the first example, the fifth row's fifth column is 1, which might not align with this rule because it's not a 5. So, that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the sum of the two cells diagonally above it in the input, but if that sum is greater than zero, it's set to 1. That would align with the presence of 1s and 3s in the outputs, but again, not sure about the exact mapping.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe the rule involves the sum of the diagonals in a certain direction. For example, for each cell (i,j), the output is the sum of all input cells (k,l) where k - l = i - j. But without seeing the exact pattern, it's difficult to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output cell is the maximum of the two diagonals leading into it. But I'm not confident in this either.\n\nWait, looking at the third example, the output has a 5 in the last row, first column, and a 4 in the other positions of the last row. The input's last row has a 5 in the first column and 0 elsewhere. So maybe the rule is that the output cell is 5 if it's on the diagonal of the input's last row, and 4 otherwise.\n\nBut in the first example, the fifth row's fifth column is 1. The input's fifth row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], so the diagonal would be 0. But the output has a 1 there, which doesn't fit this rule.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule involves the number of times a certain value appears along a diagonal. For example, if a diagonal has 5, it results in 5 in the output. But in the first example, the output has 1s where the input has 0s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each output cell is the sum of the input cells along the diagonal from (0,0) to (i,j). So, for each (i,j), sum all input cells where the diagonal index is equal to i - j. If that sum is positive, output is 1; otherwise, 0. But in the first example, the fifth row's fifth column is 1, so the sum should be at least 1. But the sum from the input's main diagonal would be 0, so that doesn't explain the 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the input cells along a diagonal from (0,0) to (i,j), but if the sum is greater than zero, the output is 1. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, let's consider that the rule might involve the parity of the sum of indices. For example, if i + j is even, the output is 1; else, 0. But in the first example, the fifth row has a 1 at (5,5), which is i+j=10, even. The output also has 1s there. But in the sixth row, (6,5) is 0, which is i+j=11, odd, so 0, which fits. So maybe the rule is that the output cell is 1 if i + j is even, and 0 otherwise. But then, looking at the third example, the last row has a 5 in the first column, which is i=14, j=0. i+j=14, even, so 1. But in the output, it's 5, not 1. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is more complex. Maybe it involves the product of i and j. For example, if i * j is even, output is 1; else, 0. Let's test. In the first example, (5,5): 5*5=25, odd, output 1, which matches. (6,5): 30, even, output 0, which matches. (14,0): 0, even, output 1, but in the output, it's 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 1 if either i or j is even. But in the first example, (5,5): both odd, output 1. That doesn't fit. (6,5): 6 is even, output 1, which matches. (14,0): 14 is even, output 1, but in output, it's 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of the digits of i and j. For example, i=5, j=5: 5+5=10, but sum is 1. In the output, it's 1. (6,5): 6+5=11, sum is 2. But in output, it's 0, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe instead of looking for a pattern in the grid, I should consider how the rule affects the rows and columns. For example, in the first example, the output has 1s in positions where the input has 1s, but in different positions. So, perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) in the output is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's cell (j,i), and 0 otherwise. That would explain the 1s in the first output row, but in other rows, it might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is 1 if it's the same as the cell above it in the input. But that would make the output the same as the input, which is not the case.\n\nWait, looking at the second example, the output has 5s at specific positions. Maybe the rule is that each cell (i,j) is 5 if the cell (j,i) in the input is 5, and 0 otherwise. That would fit some of the 5s, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) is the sum of the input cells (k,l) where k + l = i + j. But without more data, it's hard to determine.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) in the output is 1 if there's a 5 in the diagonal of the input grid that passes through (i,j). For example, in the first output row, (5,5) is 1 because the input's (5,5) is 1, but (5,5) is also on the diagonal of the last row. That might explain the 1s in the output.\n\nBut looking at the third example, the last row has a 5 in the first column. If the rule is that each cell is 1 if it's on the diagonal of the input's last row, then (14,0) would be 1, but in the output, it's 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) is 1 if the diagonal cell (i,i) in the input is 5, and the sum of the digits of i is even. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) in the output is 1 if the sum of the input's diagonal from (0,0) to (i,j) is positive, and 0 otherwise. Let's test. In the first example, the fifth row's fifth column: sum is 0 (since all diagonal cells are 0), so output is 0, but in output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the product of the diagonal elements up to (i,j). But again, without more data, it's speculative.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the rule is to take the maximum value along each diagonal direction. For example, each cell (i,j) in the output is the maximum value of the input cells along the diagonal from (0,0) to (i,j). If the maximum is positive, output is 1; else, 0. Let's test.\n\nIn the first example, the fifth row's fifth column: the diagonal from (0,0) to (5,5) is all 0s, so output is 0, but in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is the opposite: each cell (i,j) in the output is 1 if the diagonal from (0,0) to (i,j) has at least one 1, and 0 otherwise. Let's see. In the first example, (5,5) would be 1, which matches. (6,5): the diagonal from (0,0) to (6,5) includes (6,5) which is 0, but perhaps there's another 1 further back. But in the first example, the sixth row's fifth column is 0, so the output would be 0, which matches.\n\nIn the third example, the last row has a 5 in the first column. The diagonal from (0,0) to (14,0) includes (14,0) which is 5, so the output would be 1, but in the output, it's 5, not 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to count the number of 1s along each diagonal and use that as the output. But then, in the first example, the fifth row's fifth column would have 1, which matches, but (6,5) would have 0, which matches. However, in the third example, (14,0) would have 1, but in the output, it's 5, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the diagonal elements. For example, each cell (i,j) in the output is the sum of the diagonal elements from (0,0) to (i,j). If that sum is positive, output is 1; else, 0. Let's test.\n\nIn the first example, the fifth row's fifth column: the diagonal sum is 0, so output is 0, but in output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) in the output is 1 if the diagonal from (0,0) to (i,j) has at least one 1, and 0 otherwise. That would make the first output row have 1s where the diagonal has 1s, which matches. The sixth row's fifth column would have 0 because the diagonal up to there is 0 except possibly further back. But in the first example, (6,5) is 0, which matches. However, in the third example, (14,0) would have 1 if there's a 1 in the diagonal, but in output, it's 5, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the rule is that each cell (i,j) is 1 if the diagonal element at (i,j) is 5 and the sum of the digits of (i+j) is even. Or something along those lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) is 1 if and only if the input cell (i,j) is 5 and (i + j) is even. Let's test. In the first example, (5,5) is 1, and 5+5=10, even, so output is 1. (6,5): 6+5=11, odd, output 0. (14,0): 14+0=14, even, but in output, it's 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) is 1 if the diagonal element from (0,0) to (i,j) is 5, regardless of the sum. Let's test. In the first example, the fifth row's fifth column would have 1, which matches. (6,5) would have 0 because the diagonal up to there is 0. (14,0) would have 1, but in output, it's 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) is 5 if either the diagonal element at (i,j) is 5 and (i + j) is even, or the cell below it (i+1,j) is 5. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell (i,j) is 5 if the diagonal element at (i,j) is 5 and the sum of the digits of (i + j) is even. Let's test. In the first example, (5,5): 5+5=10, even, so output is 1. (6,5): 6+5=11, odd, output 0.

Let me start by carefully examining the examples and seeing if I can spot any patterns or transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 1, I see that the input grid has some zeros and a single '5' in the middle. The output grid seems to have the same structure but with more '0's turned into '5's where there were '1's in the input. Wait, no, in the output, the '5's are placed in different positions. Maybe it's related to the position of the '5' in the input.\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid has a '5' in the second row, and the output grid has a '5' in the fifth row. It looks like the '5's are moving in some way, perhaps towards the top or the middle. Also, in the output, there are multiple '5's in the same place, which might indicate that the rule is not just a single change but a more complex transformation.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has a '5' in the seventh row. The output has a '5' in the fourth row, but also some other '5's have shifted positions. It seems that the '5's are moving in a diagonal or vertical manner, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me think about the transformation more carefully. It looks like the rule might involve the sum of adjacent cells or some form of filtering. In Example 1, the '5' is surrounded by zeros, so perhaps it's being turned into a '5' only if the sum of its neighbors meets a certain condition.\n\nLooking at the first example again, the input has a '5' in the middle, and the output has '5's in the positions that were adjacent to the original '5'. So maybe the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it's adjacent to a '5' in the input. But in Example 2, the output has '5's in different positions, so that might not be the case.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input grid has a '5' in the second row. The output has '5's in the fifth row and also in some positions in the fourth and fifth rows. So perhaps the '5' propagates upwards and also affects the surrounding areas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves converting any '5' in the input to a '5' in the output, but also turning zeros into '5's based on some condition. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nLooking again at the examples, I notice that the output grid has a lot of zeros, and a few '5's. Maybe the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it's a '5' in the input, or if it's a zero and the sum of its neighbors is non-zero. Or perhaps it's based on the presence of a '5' in the surrounding cells.\n\nAnother idea is that the rule might involve the number of '5's in the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has at least one '5' in its neighboring cells, it becomes '5' in the output. But in Example 1, the original '5' is in the center, so its neighbors are zeros, which might not trigger a '5' in the output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input, or if any of its neighboring cells is a '5'. That would explain why in the first example, the original '5' remains, and the zeros become '5's in positions where the neighbors are zeros but the original cells are zeros. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' or if it is a '0' and any of its adjacent cells is a '5'. That would mean that any zero cell adjacent to a '5' would turn into a '5' in the output. Let me test this idea with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the original grid has a '5' in the center, so the surrounding cells are zeros. According to the rule, these zeros would become '5's because they are adjacent to a '5'. But in Example 1's output, those cells are still zeros, which would contradict this idea.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input, or if it is a '0' in the input and the sum of its neighboring cells is greater than zero. That would explain why in the first example, the '5' remains, and the surrounding zeros could become '5's if their neighbors sum to something non-zero.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a '5' in the second row. The output shows '5's in the fifth row, which are further down, so perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input or if it is a '0' and has at least one neighboring '5'.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let me check if this rule fits all the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the '5' in the center would remain. The surrounding cells, which are zeros, would become '5's because they have neighbors that are zeros, but maybe not exactly. Wait, the output shows zeros in the first and third rows, so perhaps this rule doesn't apply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input, or if it is a '0' and the sum of its neighbors is greater than zero. Let me test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the '5' remains as '5'. The surrounding cells are zeros, so their sum of neighbors is zero. According to the rule, they wouldn't become '5's. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input, or if it is a '0' and at least one of its neighbors is a '5'. That way, the '5's in the input remain, and any '0's adjacent to '5's become '5's.\n\nLet me see. In Example 1, the '5' remains, and any zeros adjacent to it would become '5's. So the output would have more '5's, but in the example provided, the output has zeros where the input had zeros, except for some positions. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input, or if it is a '0' and the sum of its neighboring cells is greater than zero. That would mean that a cell becomes '5' if it's a '5' or if it's a '0' and has at least one '5' neighbor. That would fit Example 1's '5' in the center, and any zeros adjacent to it would become '5's.\n\nBut wait, the output in Example 1 has the same '5' in the center and some zeros around it. That doesn't fit, because the '5' should remain as '5', and the surrounding zeros should become '5's if they are adjacent to '5's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to apply the rule that a cell becomes '5' if it's a '5' in the input, or if it's a '0' and at least one neighbor is '5'. In Example 1, the '5' in the center remains. The surrounding cells, which are zeros, are adjacent to '5's, so they should become '5's. But in the output, those cells are still zeros, so that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different. Perhaps it's based on the sum of the neighboring cells. For example, a cell becomes '5' if the sum of its neighbors is greater than or equal to a certain value. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has a '5' in the seventh row and a '5' in the third row. The output has '5's in the fourth and fifth rows. So maybe the '5's are moving up and down. Perhaps the rule involves the position of the '5's in the input and the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves converting any '5' in the input to a '5' in the output, but also converting zeros to '5's in certain positions based on their proximity to existing '5's.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that a '5' in the input remains as '5' in the output, and any zero in the input that is adjacent to a '5' becomes a '5' in the output. Similarly, any zero that is diagonally adjacent to a '5' might also become '5's, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to apply this rule to the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the '5' in the center is surrounded by zeros, so those zeros should become '5's. But in the output, they remain zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input, or if it is a '0' and the sum of its neighboring cells is greater than zero. That way, any zero with at least one neighbor that's a '5' would become '5'.\n\nSo in Example 1, the '5' remains, and the surrounding zeros would become '5's. But in the output, those cells are still zeros, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about what the outputs show. For example, in Example 2, the output has more '5's in some rows. Maybe the rule involves counting the number of '5's in a neighborhood and applying a threshold. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input, or if it is a '0' and the sum of its neighbors is greater than or equal to a certain value, say 3. That way, a cell would become '5' if it's a '5' or if it's a '0' and has enough '1's or '5's around it.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a '5' in the second row. The output shows '5's in the fifth row, which are further down. So perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input or if it is a '0' and has at least one neighbor that's a '5'.\n\nThat would fit because the '5's in the input remain, and the surrounding zeros (if they have '5's nearby) would become '5's. Let me check Example 3.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has '5's in rows 7 and 3. The output has '5's in row 4 and row 5. So perhaps the '5's are moving up and down based on their initial positions.\n\nIf that's the case, maybe the rule is that a '5' moves to a new position based on some transformation, but I'm not sure how that specific movement is determined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves converting any '5' in the input to a '5' in the output, but also converting any cell that is adjacent to a '5' to a '5' in the output, regardless of its own value. That way, any cell that is a '5' or has a '5' nearby becomes a '5'.\n\nLet me test this idea with Example 1. The input has a '5' in the center. The surrounding cells are zeros, so according to this rule, they would become '5's. But in the output, they remain zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is more complex. Perhaps it's based on the number of '5's in the surrounding cells. For example, a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input, or if it is a '0' and has at least three '5's in its neighboring cells.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the '5' in the center remains. The surrounding cells have fewer '5's than three, so they don't become '5's. That fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the '5' in the second row has neighboring cells that might include other '5's, so those cells would become '5's. But in the output, the '5's in the fifth row are more than just the original '5's. So maybe this rule is not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it is a '5' in the input, or if it is a '0' and the sum of its neighbors is greater than or equal to 3. That would allow more cells to become '5's.\n\nIn Example 1, the surrounding cells have a sum of zero (all zeros), so they wouldn't become '5's, which fits. In Example 2, the surrounding cells would have a sum that's greater than or equal to 3, so those cells would become '5's.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output shows more '5's in some rows. So maybe the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it's a '5' in the input, or if it's a '0' and has at least three '5's in its neighbors.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about another example to test this.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a '5' in row 7 and row 3. The output has '5's in row 4 and row 5. So perhaps the '5's are moving based on their initial positions. If a '5' is in a certain row, it moves up or down based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that a cell becomes '5' if it's a '5' in the input, or if it's a '0' and has at least three '5's in its neighbors, regardless of its own value.\n\nIn that case, in Example 1, the surrounding cells have zero '5's, so they don't become '5's, which fits. In Example 2, if the surrounding cells have enough '5's, they would become '5's, which might explain the more '5's in the output.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to be certain. I think I've got a possible rule now: a cell becomes '5' if it's a '5' in the input, or if it's a '0' and has at least three '5's in its neighboring cells.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the output grid in Example 2, the '5's in the output are likely the result of this rule being applied to the input grid.\n\nNow, applying the same rule to the third example, the output has '5's in certain positions, which I assume are the result of applying this rule to the input.\n\nOnce I have a clear rule, I can apply it to the input grid in Example 3 to generate the output.\n\nFinally, applying this rule to the user input grid, I can compute the output grid.\n</think>", 0.0]]}
