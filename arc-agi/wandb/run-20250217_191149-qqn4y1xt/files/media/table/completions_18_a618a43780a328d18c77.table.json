There are three examples provided, and I need to figure out what the rule is and then apply it to a given input grid. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the examples to understand how the input transforms into the output. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nLooking at the input and output, I notice that in the first row, the input has 1 followed by nine 0s and a 2. The output remains the same as the first row. However, in the second row of input, there's a 3 instead of 0. The output shows that the 3 becomes 2, and the last element becomes 2 instead of 2. Similarly, in the fifth row, the 3 becomes 1, and the last element changes to 2.\n\nSo, it seems like the rule is to replace any non-zero number in the input with the number 2. Let me check the other examples to confirm.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nHere, the non-zero elements (like 3 and 7) are replaced by 2, but wait, the first row has all 4s, which remain the same. So the rule isn't just replacing non-zero with 2; it's more specific. Maybe any non-zero number is replaced by 2, but I need to check.\n\nIn the output, the 3 in the second row becomes 4 in the output. Wait, that doesn't fit. So my initial thought was wrong.\n\nWait, no, looking at the output, the 3 becomes 4. Hmm, that's different. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nLooking back at Example 1, the input had 3, and the output had 2. So maybe any non-zero number is replaced by 2. But in Example 2, the input had 7, and the output had 7. So that's contradictory.\n\nWait, let me check the output. In Example 2, the last row has 7, and in the output, it's 7. So maybe the rule is that only the first row has non-zero numbers, and the rest are replaced with 2.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because in Example 1, the first row has 1 and 2, which remain the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any number that is not 1 or 2 remains the same, but that doesn't fit because in Example 2, the 3 and 7 remain the same.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the output grids more carefully. In all the outputs, the 0s remain 0, and any non-zero number is transformed into a 2. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 1 and 2, both remain the same. In the second row, the 3 becomes 2. In Example 2, the 3 becomes 4? Wait, no, in Example 2, the 3 becomes 4 in the output. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the second row of input is 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0. The output is 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0. So the 3 becomes 4. So that contradicts the initial thought that only 0s change.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by 2, but in Example 2, the 3 is replaced by 4. So that doesn't fit. Maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, looking at the output, in Example 1, the last element of the first row is 2, which was originally 2. So that's unchanged. In the second row, the last element is 2, which was originally 2. Wait, no, in Example 1, the last element of the second row is 2, but in the output, it's 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by 2, except for 1s, which remain 1. But in Example 2, the first row has 4s, which remain the same. So that would fit.\n\nWait, let's check Example 2. The first row is all 4s, which remain 4. The second row has a 3, which in the output is 4. So that contradicts the initial thought.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's look at the input and output for all examples and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- After transformation, any non-zero number is replaced by 2, except for the last element, which remains 2.\n\nIn Example 2:\n- The first row has 4s, which remain 4.\n- The second row has a 3, which becomes 4.\n- The last row has 7s, which remain 7.\n\nSo, it's not consistent across all examples. So I need to find a rule that applies to all.\n\nLooking at all the examples, I notice that in the input and output, any non-zero number in the input is replaced by 2. But in Example 2, the 3 becomes 4, which doesn't fit. So maybe there's an exception.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number in the input is replaced by 2, but in the case where the number is 2, it remains 2.\n\nLooking back at Example 1, the first row has a 2, which remains 2. The second row has a 3, which becomes 2. The last element is 2 and remains 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row has 4s, which remain 4. The second row has a 3, which becomes 4. The last row has 7s, which remain 7.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: any non-zero number in the input is replaced by 2, except when the number is 3 and 7, which become 4. Wait, but that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 3 in the second row becomes 2. In Example 2, the 3 becomes 4. So maybe the rule is that any number that is not 2 is replaced by 2, but in Example 2, a 3 is replaced by 4. So perhaps the rule is that any number that is not 1 is replaced by 2, but in Example 2, the 3 is replaced by 4.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to see if there's a common transformation across all examples.\n\nLooking at the input and output for all examples, the first row has non-zero numbers (1, 4, 5, 7) and 0s. The output for the first row is the same as the input.\n\nThe second row has 0, 3, 0, etc. In the output, the 3 becomes 2, and the last element becomes 2.\n\nThe third row has 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, etc. The 3 becomes 2.\n\nThe fourth row has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. The output remains 0.\n\nThe fifth row has 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. The 3 becomes 2, and the last element becomes 2. Wait, no, in the output, the last element is 2 instead of 2, so it's unchanged.\n\nWait, no, in the fifth row of input, the last two elements are 3 and 2. The output has 2 and 2. So the 3 in the input becomes 2 in the output.\n\nSimilarly, in the sixth row, the 3 becomes 2.\n\nIn the seventh row, the 3 becomes 2.\n\nIn the eighth row, the 3 becomes 2.\n\nIn the ninth row, the 3 becomes 2.\n\nIn the tenth row, the 3 becomes 2.\n\nWait, so in all cases where the input has a 3, the output has a 2. Similarly, the 7 in the input becomes 7 in the output? Wait, in Example 2, the last row is 7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7, which remains the same. So the rule isn't just replacing 3 with 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number that is not 1 is replaced by 2. But in Example 2, the 3 becomes 4, which contradicts that.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by 2, except when it's 1, which remains 1, and 3, which becomes 4, and 7, which remains 7.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Input has 5, which remains 5.\n- Input has 3, which becomes 2.\n- The last element in the second row is 2, which remains 2.\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Input has 4s, which remain 4.\n- Input has 3, which becomes 4.\n- Input has 7, which remains 7.\n\nIn Example 3:\n- Input has 8, which remains 8.\n- Input has 5, which becomes 5.\n- Input has 3, which becomes 4.\n- The last element is 4, which remains 4.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the last element is 4, which was originally 4, so it remains 4. So the rule is that 1 remains 1, 2 remains 2, 3 becomes 4, 4 remains 4, 5 remains 5, 7 remains 7, and other numbers remain the same.\n\nSo, the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by 2 if it's not 3 or 7, but 3 becomes 4 and 7 remains 7.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the 5 remains 5. In Example 2, the 5 remains 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 3 becomes 2. In Example 2, 3 becomes 4. In Example 3, 3 becomes 4.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number is replaced by 2, except when it's 3 or 7, which are replaced by 4.\n\nBut then in Example 2, the 7 remains 7, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any number that is not 1 is replaced by 2, except for 3 and 7, which are replaced by 4.\n\nBut then in Example 2, the 7 remains 7, so that contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is really confusing. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the output grids.\n\nLooking at all the outputs, it seems that the first and second rows of the input are unchanged, except for the third row, which has a 2 in the last column. Wait, no, in Example 1, the third row has a 2 in the last column, but in the output, the last element is 2.\n\nWait, no, in all the outputs, the last element of the third row is 2. So, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number in the input is replaced by 2 in the output, except for 3 and 7, which are replaced by 4.\n\nBut in Example 2, the first row has 4s, which remain 4. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number that is not 1 is replaced by 2, except for 3 and 7, which are replaced by 4.\n\nSo, in Example 1, the 3 becomes 4, and the 7 remains 7.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 becomes 4, and the 7 remains 7.\n\nIn Example 3, the 3 becomes 4, and the 7 remains 7.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 remains 5, which is correct.\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 remains 5, which is correct.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be that any non-zero number is replaced by 2, except when it's 3 or 7, which are replaced by 4.\n\nSo, to apply this rule, I need to check each element in the input grid. If the element is 1, it remains 1. If it's 2, it remains 2. If it's 3, it becomes 4. If it's 4, it remains 4. If it's 5, it remains 5. If it's 6, it remains 6. If it's 7, it becomes 7. If it's 8, it remains 8. Any other numbers remain unchanged.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the last row has 7, which remains 7, which fits.\n\nIn Example 1, the 3 becomes 4, which fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the 3 becomes 4, which fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the last element is 4, which remains 4.\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 3 \u2192 4\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 5 \u2192 5\n- 6 \u2192 6\n- 7 \u2192 7\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- Other numbers remain the same.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the input grid in Example 3.\n\nWait, let's take the input for Example 3:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- The first row has 8s, which remain 8.\n- The second row has 0s and 8s, which remain the same.\n- The third row has a 3, which becomes 4.\n- The rest of the rows are all 0s.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ", 0.0], ["15", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Then, I have to apply that rule to a given test input grid to get the output. Let me start by understanding the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a bunch of numbers, mostly zeros and 1s and 2s, except for the first row which has 5 and 4.

Hmm, so a 5 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2, 4 becomes 2, and the zero stays as zero.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is related to some transformation on the numbers. Let me see: in the input, there's a 5 and a 4. In the output, the 5 remains 5 and 4 becomes 2. So perhaps it's that 5s stay as 5s, 4s become 2s, and other numbers (like 3) become 0s. But looking at the first input row, the first element is 5, and the output row is the same, so that makes sense. But in the second row of the input, there's a 3, which becomes 0 in the output.\n\nWait, let me check the output rows more carefully. The first row of the output is the same as the first input. The second input row has 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 4. The output's second row is 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2. So the 5 becomes 1, the 3 becomes 2, the 4 becomes 2, and the other zeros stay as zeros. So perhaps the rule is that any non-zero number (except maybe 0?) is converted to 2 if it's a 3 or a 4, and if it's a 5, it remains 5, and zeros stay as zeros.\n\nWait, but in the first input row, the first element is 5, and the output is also 5. So that seems consistent. Let's check another input row. The third row of the input has 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. The output is 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. So the 5 becomes 1, which fits with the rule that 5 remains 5. Wait, but in the output, it's 1, not 5. So maybe the rule is that 5s stay as 5, and 3s and 4s become 2s, but 2s stay as 2. Wait, but in the input, there's a 2 in the seventh position of the first row, and the output has a 2 in the same position. So maybe 2s stay as 2s.\n\nWait, let's check another input row. The eighth row of the input is 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. The output is 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. So the 5 becomes 1, 2 stays as 2. So perhaps the rule is that 5s stay as 5, 3s and 4s become 2s, and 2s stay as 2. But wait, in the first input row, the seventh element is 0, and the output is 0, so that's consistent. But in the third row, the ninth element is 2 in the input and 2 in the output. So maybe 2s stay as 2.\n\nWait, but looking back to the first example, the output for the first row is the same as the input. So that suggests that the first row's 5 and 4 remain the same. So maybe the rule is that any 5 remains 5, any 3 or 4 becomes 2, and zeros stay as zeros. Let me test this with another input row. For example, the second row of the input has a 3, which becomes 0 in the output. That fits. The fourth row of the input has a 3, which becomes 0 in the output. So that works.\n\nNow, looking at the second example to see if the rule holds. Example 2 input has 5 in the first row, 0s, and a 7 in the last row. The output has 5, 0s, and 7 in the same position. So if 7s remain 7s, and 5s remain 5s, it fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 8s, which are turned into 8s in the output, and a 9 in the input, which remains 9 in the output. So that supports the rule that 8s and 9s stay as they are, 3s and 4s become 2s, and 5s stay as 5s, 0s stay as 0s.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the last row of the output is 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9, which matches the input. So the rule seems consistent across all examples.\n\nSo the rule is: for each element in the input grid, if it's 5, it remains 5; if it's 3 or 4, it becomes 2; if it's 0, it remains 0; if it's 2, it remains 2; if it's 7, it remains 7; and if it's 8 or 9, it remains the same.\n\nSo applying this rule to the test input grid:\n\nInput:\n5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 4\n5 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- 5s stay 5s.\n- 3s and 4s become 2s.\n- 0s stay 0s.\n- 2s stay 2s.\n- 7s stay 7s.\n- 8s and 9s stay as they are.\n\nSo the output grid should be the same as the input grid because all the elements are either 5, 3, 4, 0, 2, 7, 8, or 9, and applying the rule leaves them unchanged.\n\nWait, but in the first input row, the last element is 4, which should become 2 in the output. Let me check the output for Example 1's first row:\n\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nYes, the last element is 2. So applying the rule, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the second input row, the last element is 4, which should become 2, and that's what we see in the output.\n\nSo the rule holds for all examples and the test input. Therefore, the output grid will be the same as the input grid because all the elements meet the criteria where they are either 5, 2, 3, 4, 0, 7, 8, or 9, and applying the rule leaves them unchanged.\n\nWait, but in example 3, the last row is 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9, which is unchanged. So yes, the rule applies.\n\nSo the output grid will be the same as the input grid because all the elements in the input meet the condition that they are either 5, 2, 3, 4, 0, 7, 8, or 9, and the rule leaves them unchanged.\n</think>", 0.0], ["15", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully examining the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids are quite similar, except for some differences in the arrangement of numbers. The inputs have certain numbers that are shifted in the output, but the overall structure remains consistent. For instance, the first input row becomes the first output row, and so on. It seems like the rule involves shifting numbers in a specific way, perhaps by rotating or rearranging them within their rows.\n\nIn Example 2, I notice that the first row of the input remains the same in the output. However, the second row becomes a row of zeros, and the last row has a 7 repeated. This suggests that the rule affects the rows, especially when zeros are involved. It might be that non-zero elements are preserved or transformed in a specific pattern, while others are replaced.\n\nIn Example 3, the behavior is similar to Example 1 but with a different pattern. The first few rows are unchanged, and then other rows are transformed by shifting numbers and possibly replicating them at the end. The rule here could involve both shifting and replication of numbers.\n\nPutting this together, the common rule seems to be that certain elements in the input grid are shifted or rearranged in the output grid, while others are either preserved or replaced. The exact transformation might involve a combination of row-wise shifts and the replication of specific numbers, but without a clear visual pattern, it's challenging to pin down the exact rule.\n\nTo proceed, I'll focus on identifying how each input cell is transformed into the corresponding output cell. By comparing each cell in the input and output, I can deduce any shifts, row concatenations, or other operations that might be involved. For example, if a number in the input is moved to a different position in the output, the rule likely involves a specific permutation or rotation.\n\nOnce I've mapped out these transformations, I can apply the same rule to the given test input grid to generate the corresponding output grid. This involves checking each cell's value, determining if it's part of a shifted or replicated section, and applying the identified rule consistently across all cells.\n</think>", 0.0], ["15", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully examining both examples provided to understand any patterns or operations that are happening.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a few non-zero values. The output grid seems to be modifying these non-zero values in some way, possibly by moving them around or adjusting their positions. I notice that in the output, the non-zero values are often shifted to the left or right, and their positions seem to be shifted in a consistent manner across the rows and columns.\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid has a mix of zeros, a row of all zeros, a row with a 3 in the middle, and a row of all 7s. The output grid mirrors this but shifts the 3s and 7s to the left and right, respectively, while the 3s in the middle row move to the side. The 7s remain in their positions, which suggests that the 3s and 7s are being moved based on their specific values.\n\nIn Example 3, the input grid has mostly zeros, except for a few rows with non-zero values. The output grid shows that these non-zero rows are shifted to the right, and the specific non-zero values are moved to the left. This suggests a similar shifting pattern but with the specific values being adjusted.\n\nPutting this together, it seems like the rule involves shifting non-zero values to the left in the output. However, looking closely, in Example 2, the 3s and 7s in the middle row shift to the left, which matches a left shift. Similarly, in Example 3, the 0s are shifted to the right, which is a right shift. This inconsistency complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the shifting is a combination of both left and right shifts based on the value. For example, in the middle row of Example 2, the 3 shifts to the left, while in Example 3, the 0s shift to the right. This might mean that the direction of the shift depends on whether the non-zero value is moving left or right in the output.\n\nAnother possibility is that the shifting is not uniform but depends on the specific positions of the non-zero values within their rows and columns. For instance, in Example 1, the non-zero values in the top rows are shifted to the right, while those in the middle rows are shifted to the left. This variation suggests that the shifting direction might depend on the row and the position of the non-zero elements.\n\nAdditionally, looking at Example 3, the non-zero rows are shifted to the right, which could mean that the overall grid is being rotated. However, a rotation might not fit perfectly with the shifting of individual values, especially since the examples show that the values are moved without rotating the entire grid.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely rule is that each non-zero value in the input grid is shifted to the left in the output grid. However, this needs to be validated against the examples.\n\nLet's take Example 1: The input grid has non-zero values in specific positions. For instance, the first row has a 5 and a 4, which are moved to the right in the output. Similarly, in the middle rows, the 3s and 7s are moved to the left and right, respectively. This suggests that non-zero values are being shifted within their row and column based on their specific placement.\n\nIn Example 2, the middle row has a 3 in the center, which is moved to the left in the output. The 7s in the last row remain in their positions, indicating that non-zero values in the last row are not being shifted, which suggests that the shifting is done for non-zero values that are not in the last row.\n\nIn Example 3, the 0s in the last row are shifted to the right, while the 7s in the middle row remain in their positions. This indicates that non-zero values in the last row are not being shifted, and non-zero values in other rows are being shifted to the left.\n\nTherefore, the rule seems to be that non-zero values in the input grid are shifted to the left in the output grid. However, the shifting direction varies based on the row. For example, some non-zero values are shifted to the left, while others remain in their positions or are moved to the right.\n\nTo confirm this, let's consider the specific examples. In Example 1, the top rows have non-zero values that are shifted to the right, which contradicts the initial thought that they are shifted to the left. This suggests that my initial assumption might be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the non-zero values are being shifted to the left, but only for certain rows, and the specific movement depends on the position within the row. For instance, in the first row of Example 1, the non-zero values are shifted to the right, which could mean that the entire row is rotated to the right by one position, but this would affect all rows, not just the first one.\n\nAlternatively, the shifting might be based on the value being moved. For example, in the middle row of Example 1, the 3 is shifted to the left, which could indicate that the 3 moves to the left by a certain number of positions, but the exact number isn't clear.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a pattern in the positions of the non-zero elements. For example, in Example 1, the non-zero elements in the first row are in positions 1 and 10. In the output, they remain in the same positions. In the middle rows, the non-zero elements move to new positions, possibly to the left or right.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the 3s and 7s in the middle row move to the left and right, respectively, while the 7s in the last row remain in their positions. This suggests that the 3s are being moved left, the 7s are being moved right, and the 0s are staying in their positions.\n\nIn Example 3, the 7s in the middle row move to the right, while the 0s in the last row move to the left. This indicates that the movement of non-zero values depends on their specific value and row.\n\nTo summarize, the non-zero values in the input grid are being moved left in the output grid, but the direction of movement (left or right) varies depending on the value and position of the non-zero element. For example, smaller values like 3s are being moved to the left, while larger values like 7s are being moved to the right. The 0s stay in their positions.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that non-zero values in the input grid are shifted to the left in the output grid, with the specific direction of shift determined by the value of the non-zero element. Smaller values (like 3s) are shifted more to the left, while larger values (like 7s) are shifted to the right. The 0s remain unchanged.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Example 3, the non-zero elements in the last row (which has a 9) are being shifted to the left, resulting in the 9 appearing in the second position. Similarly, the 0s in the last row are being shifted to the right, but since there are no non-zero elements there, they remain in their positions.\n\nIn Example 1, the non-zero elements in the first row are not being moved, which fits the rule since the 0s are also non-zero and remain unchanged.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3s are being moved to the left, and the 7s are being moved to the right, which matches the rule as well.\n\nThus, the final rule is that each non-zero element in the input grid is shifted to the left in the output grid. The direction of the shift depends on the value of the non-zero element: smaller values move more to the left, while larger values move less to the left, effectively moving them to the right. The 0s remain in their positions.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input grid provided:\n\nTest Input:\n5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply the rule:\n\n- Non-zero elements in the first row: 5 and 4. Since they are non-zero, we apply the shift. They remain in their positions because the test input has 5, 3, 0, etc., but in the output, the 3s and 7s are shifted. Wait, this might be a conflict. According to the rule, non-zero elements should be shifted left. However, in the test input, the 3 in the first row is already shifted left in the output.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the rule. The rule is that non-zero elements are shifted left, so any non-zero element in the input should be moved to the left in the output. If it's already in the leftmost position, it remains the same.\n\nLooking back at the test input:\n\nFirst row: 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n\nAccording to the rule, the 3 should move to the left, but in the output, the 3 is already in the second position. So perhaps the rule is that non-zero elements that are not in the leftmost position are shifted left, moving to the left positions.\n\nWait, this might mean that the 3 in the first row moves to the left, but since it's already in the second position, it remains the same. The 4 in the first row moves to the left, but since it's already in the last position, it remains the same.\n\nSimilarly, the 5 and 4 in other rows are already in the leftmost positions, so they remain the same. The 3 in the fifth row is already in the fourth position, so it remains the same. The 7 in the last row is already in the leftmost position, so it remains the same.\n\nThus, applying the rule, the test input grid should remain the same as the output, which it does. Therefore, the output for the test input is the same as the input.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check with another example. Suppose the input grid has a non-zero element in the second position. According to the rule, it should move to the left, which would be the first position. If the input has a 5 in the second position, the output would have a 5 in the first position, and the rest of the positions would shift left accordingly.\n\nIn the test input, the non-zero elements are either already in the leftmost positions or in positions that require no shift. Therefore, the output is the same as the input.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see if there's any non-zero element that doesn't fit the rule. For example, the 3 in the first row is already in the second position, so it remains there. The 4 is in the last position, so it remains there. The 5s are in the leftmost positions, so they remain the same. The 7 in the last row is in the leftmost position, so it remains the same.\n\nYes, it seems consistent. Therefore, the output for the test input is the same as the input.\n</think>", 0.0], ["15", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples to see if I can spot any patterns or rules that are consistent across all of them.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of 1s and 2s, mostly in the first and last rows, with some 0s and 3s in the middle. The output grid seems to have mostly 0s except for a few 2s in the last few rows. It looks like the rule might involve some kind of transformation where certain values are carried over or modified based on their positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a mix of 4s, 3s, and 7s. The output grid has mostly 0s except for the last row which has 7s again. The rule here seems to be that certain values get replaced or moved. For instance, the 3s and 7s in the input are getting transformed into different values in the output. It might be related to the number of times certain patterns repeat or how they are distributed across the grid.\n\nExample 3 has a mix of 8s and 9s in the input and output grids. The rule seems similar to Example 2 but with different values. The 3s and 0s are being transformed into 8s, and the 7s remain as 7s. It looks like the rule involves counting occurrences of certain numbers and applying transformations based on those counts.\n\nPutting this together, the common rule across all examples seems to involve counting the occurrences of specific numbers in the rows and then transforming them based on those counts. For example, in Example 1, the 0s and 1s are being carried over, while the 2s and 3s are being modified. Similarly, in Example 2, the 3s and 7s are being replaced with 4s and 7s respectively, and the 0s are being removed.\n\nI think the key rule is that for each row, if a number appears more than once, it gets replaced with a specific value, and the first occurrence is kept. Alternatively, it might be that the count of a number determines how much it contributes to the output, with certain thresholds deciding whether a number is carried over or transformed.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule involves combining rows or columns in a certain way, but looking at the examples, it doesn't seem like that's the case. Instead, it's more about the individual rows and how their elements are transformed based on their values.\n\nIn Example 3, the 8s and 9s are being preserved, while other numbers are being transformed into 8s or kept as is. This suggests that the rule involves checking if a number is a certain value (like 3 or 7) and then applying a transformation based on its occurrence or position.\n\nSo, to summarize, the rule likely involves counting the occurrences of specific numbers in each row and transforming them based on how many times they appear. For example, if a number appears more than once, it might be replaced or kept as is. If it appears only once, it might be removed or modified.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the user's test input grid from Example 3, I need to go through each row and determine how the numbers are transformed. The first row has multiple 1s and 2s, so they might be transformed into 3s or 8s. The 2s in the first row become 2s, but in the output, they are 2s. Wait, actually, in Example 3's output, the first row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8, which suggests that all the 1s and 2s in the input are being transformed into 8s. So perhaps the rule is that any number greater than 2 is being converted into 8.\n\nLooking at the second row in Example 3's input, it has 5s, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4. In the output, it's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5s and 4 are being transformed to 0. That aligns with the idea that numbers greater than 2 are being converted into 8. But in this case, 5s are being converted to 0, so maybe it's the opposite: numbers less than 5 are converted to 0, and 5 and above are converted to 8.\n\nLet me check another row. The third row in Example 3's input is 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. The output is 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. Wait, that doesn't fit the pattern. The 5s and 4 are now 0 and 2. Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nLet me look back at Example 3's output. The first row is all 8s, which means that the 1s and 2s are being transformed into 8s. The 8s in the input remain as 8s, which suggests that numbers 8 and 9 are preserved. The 3s in the input become 8s in the output. The 7s in the input remain as 7s.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: any number greater than or equal to 3 is transformed into 8, and numbers less than 3 are either kept as they are (for 0 and 1) or transformed into 0.\n\nWait, in the input, the 3s become 8s, and the 7s remain 7s. So the rule is: if a number is 3 or greater, it is transformed into 8, and if it's 0, 1, or 2, it remains as is, except for 2s which become 2s in the output (like in Example 1 and 3). Or perhaps it's that numbers 3 or greater are replaced with 8, and numbers less than 3 are either kept as is or transformed to 0.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the 3s become 8s, the 7s remain 7s, but the 8s remain 8s. So the rule is that any number equal to or greater than 3 is replaced with 8, and numbers less than 3 are either kept (if they are 0, 1, or 2) or transformed to 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 3's output, the 2s in the first row remain 2s, which suggests that numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 are transformed to 0 except for 2, which is kept.\n\nWait, no. In the first row of Example 3's output, the numbers are 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8. The input had 1s, 2s, 3s, and 5s. The 1s and 2s were transformed into 8s, the 3s into 8s, and the 5s into 0s. So the rule seems to be that numbers greater than or equal to 3 are transformed into 8, and numbers less than 3 are either kept (if they are 0, 1, or 2) or transformed into 0.\n\nSo, putting this together, the rule is: any number that is 3 or greater is replaced with 8, and numbers less than 3 are either kept as they are (for 0, 1, 2) or transformed into 0.\n\nTesting this against Example 1's input:\n\nInput row: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nRule applies: 1 is less than 3, so it's kept as 1. 2 is less than 3, so kept as 2. So output is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2, which matches the first row of Example 1's output.\n\nAnother example: Input row has 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. Applying the rule: 5 \u22653 \u2192 8, 3\u22653\u21928, 0s stay, 4\u22653\u21928. So the output would be 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8, but in Example 1's output, this row becomes 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in Example 1's output, the third row is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2, which matches the input's 1 and 2. So perhaps the 5 becomes 8, but in the output, it's 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. Wait, but the 5 in the input becomes 8, while the 3 becomes 8 as well. But in the output, the 3 becomes 0. So that suggests that my initial rule is incorrect.\n\nLet me think again. In Example 1, the input row has 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4. The output row is 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the 5 becomes 8, the 3 becomes 0, and the 4 becomes 2.\n\nWait, so how does 3 become 0? Maybe the rule is that any number that is exactly 3 or greater is replaced with 8, but if it's 3, it's replaced with 0. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that any number that is 3 or greater is replaced with 8, but only if it's not 3. So 3 remains 3, but in this case, it's transformed to 0. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves the count of 3s in the row. If there's at least one 3, it's replaced with 0, otherwise, it remains as is. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 1's input row, there's a 3. So according to this rule, the 3 would become 0. Which matches the output. The 5 becomes 8, the 4 becomes 2, so that fits.\n\nLet me check Example 2's input. The first row is 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4, which remains the same. The second row has 0s, so it remains 0s. The third row has 3s, which according to the rule, would become 0. The fourth row is all 0s, remains 0s. The fifth row has 0s, remains 0s. The sixth row has 0s, remains 0s. The seventh row has 0s, remains 0s. The eighth row has 7s, according to the rule, would become 0. The ninth row has 9s, which according to the rule, would become 8. The tenth row has 0s, remains 0s. Wait, but in Example 2's output, the ninth row's 9 becomes 9, not 8. So this contradicts the rule.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is more complex. Maybe it's based on the number of times a certain value appears in the row. If the value appears more than once, it's transformed into 8; otherwise, it's kept as is.\n\nIn Example 1's input row, the 2 appears once, so it's kept as 2. The 3 appears once, so it's transformed into 0. The 4 appears once, so it's kept as 4. The 5 appears once, so it's transformed into 8. The 0s are kept as 0s. The 1s are kept as 1s. So in the output, the 3 becomes 0, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2's input row, the 3 appears once, so it's transformed into 0. The 7 appears once, so it's transformed into 9. The 9 appears once, so it's transformed into 8. The 4s are kept as 4s. The 0s are kept as 0s.\n\nIn Example 3's input row, the 3 appears once, so it's transformed into 0. The 7 appears once, so it's transformed into 9. The 9 appears once, so it's transformed into 8.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the 9 in the first row becomes 9, which contradicts the rule. So perhaps the rule isn't based on the count of a single value. Maybe it's based on the presence of any values that are 3 or higher. If the row contains any value \u22653, then all the values in the row are set to 0 except the 0s, which remain 0.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input row has 7s, which would be transformed into 0, but in the output, they are 7s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any value greater than 2 is transformed into 8, and values less than or equal to 2 are kept as is. But in Example 2, the 3 becomes 0, which contradicts that rule.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the rule involves looking at the frequency of each value in the row. For example, if a value appears more than once, it's transformed into 8; otherwise, it's kept as is. But then in Example 2's first row, all values are 4s, so no value appears more than once, so they remain 4s.\n\nIn Example 2's second row, the 3 appears once, so it's transformed into 0. The 7 appears once, so it's transformed into 9. The 9 appears once, so it's transformed into 8.\n\nIn Example 3's first row, the 3 appears once, so it's transformed into 0. The 7 appears once, so it's transformed into 9. The 9 appears once, so it's transformed into 8.\n\nIn Example 1's input row, the 3 appears once, so it's transformed into 0. The 5 appears once, so it's transformed into 8. The 4 appears once, so it's transformed into 4. The 2 appears once, so it's transformed into 2.\n\nWait, but in Example 1's output, the 3 becomes 0, the 5 becomes 8, and the 4 becomes 4. So maybe the rule is: if a value appears more than once, it's replaced with 8; otherwise, it's kept as is. But in Example 1's row, the 2 appears once, so it remains 2. The 3 appears once, so it becomes 0. The 5 appears once, so it becomes 8. The 4 appears once, so it remains 4.\n\nThat seems consistent with the examples. So the rule is: for each row, if any value in the row appears more than once, all occurrences of that value are replaced with 8. Otherwise, the row is transformed by keeping the same values, except that 0s remain 0s, 1s remain 1s, 2s remain 2s, 3s become 0, 4s remain 4s, 5s become 8, 7s become 9, and 9s become 8.\n\nWait, but in the first row of Example 1, the 3 becomes 0, and the 5 becomes 8. The 4 remains 4. The 2 remains 2. That fits the rule.\n\nIn Example 2's first row, the 3 becomes 0, the 7 becomes 9, and the 9 remains 9. The 0s remain 0s. The 4s remain 4s. The 5s remain 5s, but in the output, they are 5s. Wait, but according to the rule, 5s are not in the rule as a value to replace, so maybe they are transformed into 8. But in Example 2's output, the 5s remain 5s. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any value that is 3 or higher is replaced with 8, except for 3, which is replaced with 0. And 7 is replaced with 9, and 9 is replaced with 8. So:\n\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 3 \u2192 0\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 5 \u2192 8\n- 7 \u2192 9\n- 9 \u2192 8\n\nSo in Example 2's first row, the 3 becomes 0, the 7 becomes 9, and the 9 becomes 8. The 5 remains 5, which contradicts the rule. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any value that is 3 or higher is replaced with 8, and any value that is 7 or higher is replaced with 9, and any value that is 9 is replaced with 8. But then in Example 2's first row, the 9 would become 8, which matches the output, but the 7 in the first row would become 9, which matches the output.\n\nWait, in Example 2's first row, the 9s would be transformed into 8s, but in the output, the 9s remain 9s. So that contradicts the rule. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the rule is that any 3 or higher becomes 8, any 7 becomes 9, and any 9 becomes 8. So:\n\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 3 \u2192 8\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 5 \u2192 5 (unchanged)\n- 7 \u2192 9\n- 9 \u2192 8\n\nIn Example 2's first row, there's a 7 and a 9. So the 7 becomes 9, the 9 becomes 8. The output shows that the 7 remains 7, and the 9 becomes 8. Wait, but according to this rule, the 9 should become 8.

Let's see what the examples show.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has numbers ranging from 0 to 5, and the output grid seems to have numbers that are mostly 0 or 2, but some are higher. Similarly, in Example 2, the input grid has 4s, 3s, and 7s, and the output grid follows a similar pattern with numbers like 4, 0s, and 7. Example 3 seems to follow a similar structure, with some 8s and 9s in the input and corresponding higher numbers in the output.\n\nI notice that in all cases, the output grid has 0s except for certain positions. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the output has 1 followed by a bunch of 0s and a 2. Wait, that's interesting because the input grid has 2 and 4, but the output has a 2. Maybe the rule is that if a cell has a 2 or 4 in the input, it's carried over to the output. But looking further, other cells also seem to have non-zero outputs, so that can't be the rule alone.\n\nAnother observation is that in each row of the output, the number 2 appears only once per row. That suggests that each 2 in the input grid might be propagating to the output. Also, the 0s in the output are most of the time, except for some rows where a 2 appears. \n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has 9s, and the output also has 9s. So perhaps the rule is that 9s in the input are preserved in the output, while other numbers are transformed into 0s, except for certain cases like 2s. \n\nPutting this together, maybe the rule is that any cell with a 2 or 9 in the input grid becomes 2 in the output grid. All other cells become 0 in the output grid. Let me check this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 and 4. The output has 2 in those positions. That fits. The 4 in the input doesn't become 2, so it stays as 0. The 8s and 3s in the input don't have 9s, so they become 0s.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 7 and a 3. The output has a 7 and a 0 respectively. Wait, no, the last line of the output has a 7, so maybe my initial thought is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a 2 or 9 becomes 2 in the output, and all other cells become 0. But in Example 2, the input grid has a 7 and a 3, but the output has a 7 and a 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking back, the output in Example 2 has the last row as 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7. So the 7 in the input becomes 7 in the output, and the 3 becomes 0. That suggests that only 2s and 9s in the input become 2 in the output. The other cells, including 7s, remain as they are. But in Example 1, the 7s in the input become 0 in the output, which aligns with that rule.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 8s and 9s, and the output has the same. So 8 becomes 8, 9 becomes 9, and other cells become 0. The 3s in the input don't become anything except 0s in the output.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: any cell with a 2 or 9 in the input becomes 2 in the output. All other cells become 0. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s and 4s. The output has 2s in those positions, and 0s elsewhere, except for the first row which is mostly 0s except for the 2. That fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 4s and 7s, which become 0s in the output, except for the last row which has 7s. Wait, no, the last row of the output is 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7, which doesn't match. So my previous conclusion might be wrong.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the last row of the input is 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7, which becomes 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7. So the 7 in the input remains a 7 in the output. The 9 in the input in example 3 is preserved. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any cell with a 9 becomes 2, and all other cells become 0. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s which become 2s, and 9s which are not present, so the output is as given.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 9, which would become 2 in the output. But in the output, the last row has a 7, not a 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in the output of Example 2, the last row has 7s and a 0 in the middle. So maybe the rule is that 9s become 2s, and all other cells become 0, but the 2s in the input remain 2s, and other cells are 0.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2s in the input remain 2s, and all other cells are 0s. So the rule is: if a cell has a 2 or 9, it becomes 2 in the output. All other cells become 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 2. The input has a 7, which becomes 0. The 9 in the input becomes 2. But in the output, the last row has 7s and a 0 in the middle, which doesn't include a 2. So that contradicts the rule.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the output grids, the 0s are present in almost all cases except for certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the first row of the output is mostly 0s, with a 2 at the end. The other rows have a 0 in the middle.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 0s except for the last row, which has 7s and a 0 in the middle. The last row of the input is all 7s, so in the output, it remains all 7s except for a 0 in the middle.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 8s and 9s, which remain as is in the output, except for the last row which has 9s and 8s. The other rows have 0s except for certain positions where 0s appear.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- Any cell with a 2 or 9 in the input becomes 2 in the output.\n- All other cells become 0 in the output.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput has 2s \u2192 they become 2s in the output. The 4s become 0s. The 8s become 0s. The 3s become 0s. The 1s become 0s. The 0s remain 0s. So the output matches the given output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput has 7s, 3s, and 9. According to the rule, 9 becomes 2, but in the output, it's 7. So this contradicts the rule. Wait, but in the output, the last row has 7s and a 0. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the 9 in the input becomes 2, but in the output, it becomes 7. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 9 in the input remains 9, and 2s become 0. But that would change the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 9 in the input becomes 0, and the 2 becomes 2. But in Example 2, the 9 becomes 7, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe my initial rule is incorrect. Let's look at the output of Example 2 more carefully. The last row of the input is all 7s, and the output is the same. So perhaps 7s remain 7s in the output. The 9 in the input becomes 9, and 2s become 0.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit because in Example 1, the 2s become 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 9 in the input becomes 2, and other numbers become 0s except for the 2s.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nIn Example 1, input 2s become 2s, others become 0s.\n\nIn Example 2, input 9 becomes 2, others become 0s. But in the output, the last row has 7s and a 0, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9s become 0s, and other cells become 0s except for 2s.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2s become 2s, others become 0s.\n\nIn Example 2, the 9 becomes 0, 2s become 0, others become 0. But the last row has 7s and a 0, so that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the input and output grids.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of the input is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The output is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the 2 remains 2.\n\nThe last row of the input is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2, and the output is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the 2 remains 2.\n\nOther rows, like the fifth row, input is 1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2, and output is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the 3 becomes 0, and the 2 becomes 2.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the rule is that any cell with a 2 in the input becomes a 2 in the output, and any cell with a 3 becomes 0. But then, in Example 2, the input has a 3 in the second row, which becomes 0 in the output. Let's check Example 2:\n\nInput second row: 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3. Output second row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So 3 becomes 0, and 0 remains 0.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s, which become 0s in the output.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: any cell with a 2 becomes 2, any cell with a 3 becomes 0, and all other cells become 0.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2s, so they become 2s in the output. The 3s are not present, so they remain 0s. The 8s and 4s become 0s. So the output matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s, which become 0s in the output, and the 9 becomes something? Wait, in Example 2, the input has a 9, but in the output, the last row is 7s and a 0. So 9 would become 0? But in Example 1, the 9s are not present.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has a 9 in the first row, but the output has a 7. So perhaps the 9s become 7s. That contradicts the previous rule.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is different. Let me think again.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput last row: 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7.\n\nOutput last row: 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7.\n\nSo the 7s remain 7s, and a 0 appears in the middle. So perhaps the 9 in the input becomes 7 in the output.\n\nWait, but the input doesn't have a 9 in Example 2. It has 7s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 9 in the input becomes 0, and other cells become 0s except for 2s.\n\nIn Example 2, the 9 becomes 0, and the 7 remains 7.\n\nIn Example 3, the 9s remain 9s, and 3s become 0.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- Any cell with a 2 becomes 2.\n- Any cell with a 9 becomes 0.\n- All other cells become 0.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput has 2s \u2192 2s in output. 9s not present \u2192 0s. 8s and 3s \u2192 0s. So output matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput has 7s \u2192 0s. 9s not present \u2192 0s. 3s not present \u2192 0s. So the output should have 0s everywhere except 7s and 0s. Wait, but the output has 7s and 0s in the middle. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests the rule is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps 9s become 9 in the output, but in the examples, they remain as 9s.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has 9s, which remain 9s in the output. So perhaps the rule is:\n\n- Any cell with a 2 becomes 2.\n- Any cell with a 9 becomes 9.\n- All other cells become 0.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput 2 becomes 2. 9 not present. 8s become 0s. 3s become 0s. So output matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput 2s become 2s. 9s become 9s. 7s become 0s. 3s become 0s. So output should have 9s, 7s, and 0s, but in the output, the 9s remain 9s. Wait, in the output, the last row has 7s and a 0. So perhaps the 9s remain 9s, and 2s become 2s. So the rule holds.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput 2s become 2s. 9s become 9s. 8s become 0s. 3s become 0s. So output matches.\n\nSo this seems to fit all examples.\n\nTherefore, the rule is:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is 2, it becomes 2 in the output.\n- If the cell is 9, it becomes 9 in the output.\n- All other cells become 0 in the output.\n\nSo now, to apply this rule to the given input grid in Example 3, we can create the output by checking each cell:\n\n- If it's 2 \u2192 output 2.\n- If it's 9 \u2192 output 9.\n- Otherwise, output 0.\n\nSo, for each row in the input, create a new row where each cell is either 2, 9, or 0, depending on whether it was 2, 9, or something else.\n\nLet me apply this to the input of Example 3:\n\nInput rows:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 4\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- 4 \u2192 0\n- 3 \u2192 0\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 9 \u2192 9 (but there are none here)\n- 0 \u2192 0\n\nSo the output rows are:\n\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, but in the output grid, the last row has 9 in the input's second position, but the output has 0. Hmm, that contradicts.\n\nWait, no, in Example 3, the input has 3 as a cell in the second row, and in the output, it's 0. So according to the rule, 3 becomes 0.\n\nSo all cells with 2 become 2, 9 become 9, others become 0.\n\nThus, the output grid I provided matches this rule.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the input grid in Example 3, the output grid is as I provided above.\n", 0.0], ["15", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Looking at the examples provided, especially Example 1 and Example 2, I notice that there's a pattern in how zeros and non-zero numbers are handled.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has some 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, and the output grid mostly remains the same except for the last row, which only has a 2. This suggests that the rule might involve modifying certain positions based on specific conditions.\n\nLet's break it down. In the input, if there's a 1 in the same column as a 2, it gets replaced by a 2 in the output. Similarly, if there's a 3 in the same column as a 0, it also gets replaced by a 2. The presence of a 4 in the input grid doesn't change except for the last row. The same pattern seems to apply to Example 2 and Example 3 as well.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each cell in the output grid, if the cell in the input grid is 1 and the corresponding cell in the same column is 2, then the output cell becomes 2. Additionally, if the input cell is 3 and the same column is 0, the output cell becomes 2. There's no change for 4s, and zeros in other columns are unaffected except when paired with 2s.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input grid, I can predict the output grid by identifying which cells meet these conditions and updating them accordingly.\n</think>", 0.0], ["15", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me look at the examples provided to figure out what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 10x10 grid with mostly zeros and some 1s and 2s. The output also seems to have similar patterns but with some differences. For instance, the first few rows in the output are the same as in the input, but then they change. I think the rule might involve some kind of transformation or operation applied to the rows or columns.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a lot of zeros and some 3s and 4s. The output has the same structure but with different zeros and 7s and 4s. It looks like the 3s and 4s are being transformed into 7s and 4s, but I'm not sure exactly how.\n\nExample 3 is a bit different. It starts with all 8s, then some zeros, and then changes to 9s in the end. The output shows that the 8s and 9s are preserved, but there are some 0s in between. It seems like the rule here is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions or values.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the rule involves checking each element in the grid and applying a transformation based on its value. For example, in the first example, a 1 or 2 might be transformed into a 2 or remain the same, while a 4 might become a 2. Similarly, in the second example, a 3 or 4 becomes a 7, and a 0 remains 0. \n\nI think the key is to find out which specific values are being replaced and how. Maybe certain rows or columns have specific transformations applied. For instance, in Example 1, it looks like the first few rows are unchanged, but after that, some elements are being modified. Similarly, in Example 2, the 3s and 4s in the input are turning into 7s and 4s in the output.\n\nTo generalize, the rule could involve checking each element and applying a specific transformation, possibly based on its value and position. For example, if an element is a 1, it might become a 2, or if it's a 4, it might become a 2. The exact rule would require analyzing each example to see what changes occur.\n\nIn conclusion, the rule involves mapping each input value to an output value based on certain conditions, likely involving row and column transformations or position-specific changes within the grid.\n</think>", 0.0], ["15", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the first example to understand what's happening.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a mix of 5s, 3s, and 4s. The output seems to have mostly 0s except for some changes. It looks like when there's a 5, it stays as 5. When there's a 3, it becomes 0 except in certain positions where it remains 3. There's also a 4 that stays as 4. \n\nWait, in the output, some 4s stay the same, but others turn into 0s. Maybe the rule is that if a cell has a 4, it stays 4, but if it's a 5 or 3, it becomes 0. That could explain some of the changes. Also, the 5s don't change, so that's another case.\n\nLooking at the second example (Example 2), the input has 4s in the first row, 0s elsewhere, and some 3s and 7. The output mirrors the input except for the 7, which becomes 0. So perhaps 7s turn into 0s, while other numbers stay the same. That fits with the rule I thought about earlier.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 8s, 3s, and a 9. The output shows that 8s stay, 3s turn into 0s, and 9s stay. So this supports the idea that non-zero numbers (except maybe 0) are converted to 0 under certain conditions.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule seems to be:\n- If a cell has a value of 0, it stays 0.\n- If a cell has a value greater than 0 (like 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9), it becomes 0 unless it's exactly 7 or 9, which stay the same.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n- 7 \u2192 7\n- 9 \u2192 9\n- All other non-zero numbers (3,4,5,7,8,9) \u2192 0\n\nThat explains the output grids in all examples.

Let's look at the examples to figure out what's happening.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has numbers ranging from 0 to 8, and the output grid seems to have mostly zeros except for some specific numbers in certain positions. I notice that in the output, the same numbers appear in specific columns. For instance, in the first example, the 0s stay as 0s, but some non-zero numbers appear in the first and last columns. It looks like the rule might involve keeping certain columns based on some condition.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a lot of zeros, and the output mostly zeros except for the first and last rows, which are same as the input, and the middle row has a 7 in the first and last columns. This suggests that the rule might be combining columns where the numbers in the middle are non-zero.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a mix of numbers, and the output keeps the same numbers but shifts some columns. For example, the 8s stay in the first column, and the 9s stay in the last column. This indicates that the rule involves keeping certain columns based on the presence of specific numbers.\n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be that for each row in the output, the same numbers are kept from the input grid in the same columns. Specifically, the first column of the output has the same numbers as the first column of the input, the last column has the same numbers as the last column of the input, and the middle columns might be zeroed out if there are any non-zero numbers in the corresponding middle columns of the input.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the given test input grid should result in a grid where the first and last columns are the same as in the input, and the middle columns are zero out if there were non-zero values. Let me check this against the examples to make sure.\n\nIn Example 1, the first and last columns of the output are same as the input, and the middle columns are zeroed out except for specific positions. This matches the rule I just thought of.\n\nFor the test input, the first column is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5], and the last column is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. So the output should have the same first and last columns, and the middle columns filled with zeros. Let me write down the output:\n\nFirst column: 5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\nLast column:4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\nMiddle columns filled with zeros.\n\nSo the output grid should look like this:\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\nWait, let me check the test input again. The test input has 9 columns, so the first column is 10 elements, and the last column is the 10th element. In the output, the first column is same, last column is same, and middle columns are zero.\n\nSo the output should have the same first and last columns, and zeros in the middle.

Let me start by carefully examining the examples given.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has several rows, some with 0s and some with 3s and a 4. The output grid seems to have mostly 0s, except for the rows where the original input had 3s or 4s, which are transformed into 2s or 4s, and the 4 in the last column becomes 2. It looks like the rule might involve counting the number of non-zero elements in each row or column.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the input grid has a 7 in the last row. The output grid keeps that 7 as is, and other elements are set to 0 except for rows where the input had 3s, which become 4s. This suggests that there's a transformation where certain conditions are met, such as when a row has a 3 or a 7, it gets updated.\n\nIn Example 3, the pattern is similar. The 7 in the last row remains, and other 3s are updated to 8s. This points towards a rule where non-zero values are either counted or transformed based on specific conditions.\n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be that for each row, if there are any non-zero elements, they are updated based on their values. For instance, a 3 might be transformed into an 8, and a 7 stays as is. Also, the presence of a 4 in certain positions might indicate that it needs to be counted or transformed as well.\n\nThe key observation is that the transformation occurs when the row has non-zero elements. Specifically, the presence of a 3 or 7 in a row leads to a change in the value, while 0s remain 0. This suggests that the rule is applied per-row basis, where each row's elements are processed according to these non-zero conditions.\n\nSo, to predict the output grid for the given input, each row should be processed by checking if there are any non-zero elements. If there are, the 3s become 8s, and the 7 remains as 7, while 0s remain 0. This should follow the same logic as the examples provided.\n</think>", 0.0], ["15", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a bunch of 1s and 2s, and the output shows that 2s are being replaced by 0s, except for some cases where 2s stay as 2. Hmm, maybe the rule involves subtracting something from the numbers.\n\nIn Example 2, I see that some 0s become 4s, and a 7 turns into another 7. That suggests that maybe certain operations are happening, like adding or multiplying numbers by 4. For instance, when a 0 becomes 4, it's like 0*4=0, but 3 turns into 12, which then becomes 0. Wait, but in the output, it's 0 and 4. Maybe it's something like multiplying by 4 and then taking modulo 4 or something, but that might complicate things.\n\nIn Example 3, I notice that 8s stay the same, 9s stay the same, and 3s become 0, but there are more changes. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are converted based on their positions or something else.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, in Example 1, the first row of the input is 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The output has 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the 1 and 2 didn't change, except maybe the 2 at the end? Or perhaps the 2s are being reduced to 0. But in the second row of the output, the 2 is replaced by 0. Wait, maybe the rule is that any number greater than 1 is reduced to 0.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the output shows 4s, so if the rule is that 4s are replaced by 4, but that doesn't fit the first row where 4 remains 4. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nLet me try to find a consistent transformation. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the input is [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2], and the output is the same as the input except the last element is 2. So maybe the 2 is being reduced to 0. Similarly, in the second row, the last element becomes 0. So the rule could be that any non-zero value that is not 1 or 1 becomes 0, but that doesn't fit because 2 remains 2.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 1s are kept, and 0s are turned into 0s, and any other number is turned into 0. But then in Example 2, the 7 remains 7, which would contradict that rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves subtracting 1 from non-zero numbers. So 2 becomes 1, but in the output, it's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any number that is not 0 remains the same, except when it's 2, it turns into 0. But in Example 2, a 7 remains 7, which would not fit this rule.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to see if the numbers in the output are related to the numbers in the input by some mathematical operation.\n\nLooking at the first row of Example 1, input has 1,0,0,...2. The output has 1,0,0,...2. So 1 remains 1, 0 remains 0, and 2 remains 2. So maybe 2 is being reduced to 0.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row input has 4 and becomes 4 in the output. So 4 remains 4. The 7 in the input becomes 7 in the output. So maybe numbers that are not 0 or 1 are being reduced to 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input has 2, which is not 0 or 1, and it becomes 0. So perhaps any number greater than 1 is turned into 0.\n\nBut then in Example 3, the input has 8, which remains 8 in the output. So that contradicts the idea that numbers greater than 1 become 0.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different for even and odd numbers?\n\nWait, looking at Example 1, the 2 in the input becomes 0 in the output. If it's even, maybe subtract 2. But 2-2=0, which fits. 4-4=0, but in Example 2, 4 remains 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of digits. But 2 has one digit, 4 has one, 7 has one. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any number that is a multiple of 4 is reduced to 0. Let's see: in Example 2, 4 remains 4, so that's not it. 8 remains 8, which is a multiple of 4 as well.\n\nHmm, maybe it's more about the position of the numbers. For example, in Example 3, the 8s stay the same, the 9s stay the same. So maybe if a number is 8 or 9, it remains as is, but perhaps 0, 1, and 2 become 0, while 3 and 4 become 0 as well. But in Example 1, the 2 remains 2, which contradicts that.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any number greater than 1 is turned into 0, and 1 remains 1. But in Example 2, the 7 remains 7, so that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 1 and 0 remain the same, 2 remains 2, and 4 and above become 0. But in Example 2, the 7 remains 7, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's see, in Example 1, the number of zeros in the input is 8, and in the output, it's also 8. The number of 2s is 1 in the input and 1 in the output. Similarly, in Example 2, the number of zeros is 8, and 7s are reduced to 7s, but the count of 7s remains the same. So perhaps the rule is that 0s remain 0s, and any number greater than 1 is turned into 0, except for 7s.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 2 remains 2, so that contradicts that idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 0s stay 0s, 1s stay 1s, and any number greater than 1 is turned into 0. But then in Example 2, the 7 remains 0, which contradicts that.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try to see if there's a transformation that can be applied to each cell individually.\n\nLet's take the first row of Example 1:\nInput: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nSo 1 remains 1, 0 remains 0, and 2 remains 2. So maybe the rule is that 2s are reduced to 0, but 1s and 0s stay the same.\n\nIn Example 2:\nInput has a 7, which remains 7. So that contradicts the idea that 7s are reduced to 0.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 0s stay 0s, 1s stay 1s, 2s stay 2s, 3s become 0, 4s become 0, 5s become 0, 6s become 0, and 7s become 7. So 7s remain 7, which fits.\n\nIn Example 3:\nInput has 8s which remain 8, 9s which remain 9, 3s become 0, and the 2s become 0.\n\nSo the rule could be: any number that is 0, 1, or 2 remains the same, 3,4,5,6 become 0, and 7,8,9 remain as they are.\n\nLet me test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1:\nInput has 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2. According to the rule, 1 remains 1, 0 remains 0, 2 remains 2. The output has the same, so the rule fits.\n\nIn Example 2:\nInput has 4s, which remain 4, a 7 which remains 7, and 0s which remain 0. The output matches, so the rule fits.\n\nIn Example 3:\nInput has 8,9 which remain as 8,9. 3 becomes 0, 2 becomes 0. The output matches, so the rule fits.\n\nSo the rule is that any number that is 0, 1, or 2 remains the same. Numbers greater than 2 and less than 7 (4,5,6) are reduced to 0. Numbers 7,8,9 remain as they are.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the input in Example 3.\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- 8s,9s remain 8s and 9s.\n- 7 remains 7.\n- 3 becomes 0.\n- 2 becomes 0.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nWait, but in the output, the 3 becomes 0.

So, looking at the examples provided, I need to find a common rule that maps the input grids to the output grids. Let's start by comparing the input and output for each example.\n\nStarting with Example 1, the input has a bunch of 1s and 2s, mostly on the top left, except for a few in the middle and bottom. The output seems to be a grid where the 2s and 4s have been moved to specific positions. For instance, the 2s from the middle rows end up in the bottom rows, and the 4s from the bottom rows move to the top right. It looks like the rule involves shifting certain numbers and moving them according to their positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the output seems to be a transformation where the first and second rows remain mostly unchanged, except for the last row which has a 7 instead of 4. The middle rows also shift the 0s and 3s into new positions. This suggests that the rule involves shifting the numbers and possibly rotating them around the grid.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the pattern is similar to Example 1 but with different numbers. The 8s and 9s are shifted in a way that their positions are mirrored or rotated. The rule here might involve swapping rows and columns or using a specific rotation mechanism.\n\nPutting it all together, the common rule seems to be a combination of swapping rows and columns and using a rotation mechanism. Specifically, for each number in the input grid, its position is transformed by swapping its current row and column, and then rotating the grid 180 degrees. This explains how the numbers are moved to their new positions in the output grid.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I'll apply this rule to the provided test input grid:\n5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 4\n5 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4\n5 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 4\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\nApplying the rotation and swapping rule, the first row becomes the last row after rotation, and the numbers are rearranged accordingly. After applying the rule, the output grid should have the numbers moved in a specific pattern, maintaining the grid structure but with the numbers in their new positions based on the rule.\n</think>", 0.0], ["15", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully analyzing the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a couple of non-zero numbers. The output grid seems to have some of these non-zero numbers moved around or changed. Specifically, in the first row of the output, the non-zero remains in the same position, but in the second row, the 1 moves to the third column, and another 1 moves to the eighth column. The third and fourth rows also have similar shifts.\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid has a row with all 4s and another row with a single 7. The output grid keeps this structure but moves the 7 and the 4s within their respective rows. The 4s in the input stay in their positions, and the 7 moves to the bottom right, while the 1s in the input elsewhere are also moving to specific places.\n\nExample 3 shows a similar pattern but with 8s and 9s. The output grid seems to shift these numbers in a way that maintains their structure but relocates them within their rows and columns.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the rule involves each row having the non-zero numbers move down while maintaining their original positions. This seems to be a consistent pattern across all examples.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each row in the input grid, the non-zero numbers remain in their original columns, but they shift down by one position. If they reach the bottom of the grid, they stay there. This explains how the output grid is formed by moving the non-zero elements down within their respective rows.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input grid should involve shifting each non-zero number down by one row while keeping their column positions the same. Any non-zero elements that reach the bottom row stay there.\n</think>", 0.0], ["15", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample

So, looking at the example, the input and output grids are related through a specific rule. My job is to figure out what that rule is and apply it to the test input grid to get the correct output.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first part of the examples. The input starts with some 0s and 4s, and the output seems to be a mix of 0s and 4s as well. The rule probably involves some transformation of the input numbers.\n\nLooking at the first example:\n\nInput row 1:\n0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0\n\nOutput row 1:\n0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0\n\nHmm, so in the first input, the 4s become 8s. So maybe the rule is multiplying by 2 or adding something. Wait, 4 becomes 8, that's a multiplication by 2. Let me check another part.\n\nLooking at the second row of the first example:\n\nInput row 2:\n0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0\n\nOutput row 2:\n0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0\n\nSame pattern, 4 becomes 8.\n\nNow, let's look at a row where the input has 8 and 0. Let's see:\n\nInput row 5:\n0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0\n\nOutput row 5:\n0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0\n\nWait, that's the same as the second row. So it seems consistent.\n\nNow, let's see another part. In the third example, the input has 4s and 8s, and the output has 2s and 2s. Wait, no, looking at the third input and output:\n\nThird example input:\n\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 3 3 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 2 2 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 3 3 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 2 2 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 3 3 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 2 2 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 3 3 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 2 2 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n\nLooking at some rows, for example, row 5 of the input is:\n\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n\nAnd the output row 5 is:\n\n0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0\n\nSo, in the input, 4 becomes 8. So, there's a multiplication by 2 here.\n\nLooking at another row, let's see:\n\nInput row 6:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n\nOutput row 6:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nLooking at the input row 6, the output row 6 is changing the 4s to 8s and also the 8s? Wait, no, looking at output row 6, the input row 6 has 4s and 8s. So, the output seems to have 8s wherever the input has 4s, and 0s where the input has 8s.\n\nWait, no, let me check. For example, the input row 5:\n\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n\nOutput row 5:\n\n0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0\n\nSo, 4 becomes 8. So, perhaps when a 4 is present, it becomes 8. But what about when there's an 8? I need to see the other rows.\n\nLooking at row 6 of input:\n\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nOutput row 6:\n\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nSo, the input row is all 4s, and output is all 4s. So, no change there.\n\nAnother row, row 7 of input:\n\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0\n4 4
