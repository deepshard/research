Let me see what's in the input. The top-left corner has all zeros, except the bottom row where there's a 1 in the second and third columns. So maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in the entire grid? Let me check.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nThe input here has 2s in the top-left and bottom-right corners.

Let me go through each example one by one to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nHmm, looking at the input, the first row is all zeros, the second row has a 1, and the third row also has a 1. The output is 1 1. It seems like each row in the output corresponds to a cell in the input where a 1 is present. But wait, in the input, both the second and third rows have 1s, but the output only has 1s. So maybe the rule is to take the value from each cell in the row that has a 1 in the input, and the output is the minimum or maximum of those values? Or perhaps just the sum? Let me check the other examples first.\n\nMoving to Example 2:\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nHere, the input has 2s in several places. The output is 2 again. So each output cell is 2. This might mean that the rule is to find the maximum value in each row of the input and output that. Let me test this with Example 1. The input rows have 0s and a 1. The maximum in each row is 0 and 1, but the output is 1 and 1. Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe it's not the maximum. Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the row. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the rows have sums of 0, 1, and 0. The output is 1 and 1. That doesn't align. Maybe it's the sum of the columns. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the columns in Example 1:\nColumn 1: 0,1,0 \u2192 sum is 1\nColumn 2: 0,0,1 \u2192 sum is 1\nColumn 3: 0,0,0 \u2192 sum is 0\nSo the output is [1,1,0], but the example shows [1,1]. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the minimum of each row. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, rows have sums 0,1,0. The minimum is 0,0,0. Output is 1,1. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum of each column. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1:\nColumns:\n1: 0,1,0 \u2192 max 1\n2: 0,0,1 \u2192 max 1\n3: 0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\nSo the output would be [1,1,0], but the example output is [1,1]. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum of each row. Let's see.\n\nExample 1 rows:\nRow 1: 0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\nRow 2:1,0,0 \u2192 max 1\nRow 3:0,1,0 \u2192 max 1\nSo the output would be [0,1,1], but the example shows [1,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's look at Example 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8\n\nHere, the input has two 8s in the second row, and two 8s in the first row. The output is 8 for all cells. So perhaps the rule is that if any cell in a row or column is 8, the output is 8. Let me test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 1,1. The input has 1s in the second and third rows. So if the rule is that if any cell in the row is 1, output is 1. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the second and third rows have 1s, so output is 1,1. That fits. Let's check Example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput: 2 2 2\n\nHere, the input has 2s in some rows. If the rule is that if any cell in the row is 2, output is 2, then the output would be 2,2,2. That fits. Now Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:7\n\nHere, the input has 7 in the first row. So if the rule is that if any cell in the row is 7, output is 7, then the output is 7, which matches. That seems to fit all examples.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each output cell, if any cell in its row is non-zero and equal to a certain value, output that value. Wait, in Example 4, the output is 8 for all cells because the input has 8s in some cells, but how does that relate to the output?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if any cell in the row or column is non-zero and equal to 8, the output is 8. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 4, all output cells are 8. The input has 8s in some rows and columns. So perhaps the rule is that if any cell in the input is 8, the output is 8, but that doesn't fit because in Example 1, there are 1s and 0s but non-zero 1s and 0s, but the output is 1 and 1.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if any cell in the row or column is 8, the output is 8, but that seems too broad.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to find the maximum value in each group of cells that are connected in some way. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, it seems that the output is the maximum of the values in the input grid for that particular row or column. Let's test this.\n\nExample 1:\nEach row's maximum:\nRow 1: max(0,0,0)=0\nRow 2: max(1,0,0)=1\nRow 3: max(0,1,0)=1\nSo output would be [0,1,1], but the example shows [1,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it's the minimum of each row. Let's see.\n\nExample 1:\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2:1\nRow 3:0\nOutput: [0,1,0], but example shows [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule. Let's look at Example 2 again.\n\nExample 2:\nInput has 2s in some cells. Output is 2s. So perhaps the rule is that if any cell in the row is 2, output is 2, regardless of other cells.\n\nExample 3:\nInput has 7 in the first row. Output is 7.\n\nExample 4:\nInput has 8s in some rows and columns. Output is 8.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output is the minimum value in the entire grid. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the minimum is 0, but output is [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the maximum of the minimum values in each row and column. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each output cell, if any cell in its row is 8, then output 8. Let's see.\n\nExample 4:\nInput has 8s in some rows, so output is 8 for all cells. That fits.\n\nExample 1:\nThe second and third rows have 1s. So if any cell in the row is 1, output 1. But in Example 1, the output is 1 and 1. So that fits.\n\nExample 2:\nInput has 2s in some cells. If any cell in the row is 2, output 2. The output is [2,2,2], which fits.\n\nExample 3:\nInput has 7 in the first row. If any cell in the row is 7, output 7. Output is [7], which fits.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: for each output cell, if any cell in its row is equal to a certain value, output that value. But looking at the examples, the rule is more specific. It's not just any cell, but perhaps any cell with a value equal to a certain number.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output cell is the maximum of the values in the row and column. Let's test.\n\nIn Example 1:\nRow 2 and 3 have 1s. So for the first output cell, which is in row 1, column 1, the row has 0,0,0, so max is 0. But the output is 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the row and column. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1:\nRow sum is 0, column sum is 1 (for first cell) and 1 (for third cell). So maybe sum of row and column. For row 1, sum is 0, column 1 sum is 1, so total 1. For row 1, column 2: 0+0=0. For row 1, column 3: 0+0=0. So output would be [1,0,0], but the example shows [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the maximum of the row's non-zero values. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1:\nRow 1 has all zeros, so max is 0.\nRow 2 has 1, so max is 1.\nRow 3 has 1, so max is 1.\nOutput: [0,1,1], but the example shows [1,1]. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output is the maximum of the values in the input grid. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: max is 1 \u2192 output 1.\nExample 2: max is 2 \u2192 output 2.\nExample 3: max is 7 \u2192 output 7.\nExample 4: max is 8 \u2192 output 8.\nThis fits all examples. So, the rule is to take the maximum value in the entire input grid.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output has two 1s, but the maximum is 1. That fits. Similarly, Example 2's output is 2, which is the max. Example 3's output is 7, same as max. Example 4's output is 8, same as max.\n\nSo, the rule is to output the maximum value from the entire input grid.\n\nLet me confirm with the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput max is 1 \u2192 output 1 (but output is 1,1). Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the output is a vector where each cell is the maximum of their respective rows or something else.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the output is 1 1, but the maximum is 1. So, perhaps it's the maximum of each row.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nExample 1:\nRow 1: max 0\nRow 2: max 1\nRow 3: max 1\nSo output would be [0,1,1], but the example shows [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the maximum of each cell's value. So for each cell, the output is the maximum between the cell's value and the cell's row's maximum.\n\nBut that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the maximum of the corresponding cell in the input grid and its row's maximum. Let's test Example 1.\n\nRow 1 max is 0. So each cell is max(0, input cell). So row 1 becomes 0,0,0. Row 2 max is 1. So row 2 becomes max(1,0)=1, max(0,1)=1, max(0,0)=0 \u2192 [1,1,0]. Row 3 max is 1. So row 3 becomes max(0,0)=0, max(1,1)=1, max(0,0)=0 \u2192 [0,1,0]. Then the output would be [0,1,0,1,0,0], but the example shows [1,1]. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the maximum value in the entire grid. So for any input grid, the output is a grid of the same size as the maximum value in the input grid.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 0s and 1s, so max is 1. So output is a grid of 1s wherever the maximum is achieved. Wait, but the output is [1,1], which is 1s in the first two rows. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the input has 2s, so output is 2s. That fits.\n\nExample 3: input has 7s, output is 7 \u2192 fits.\n\nExample 4: input has 8s, output is 8 \u2192 fits.\n\nSo the rule is: output a grid where each cell is the maximum value in the input grid. That is, the entire output grid is filled with the maximum value present in the input.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output is [1,1], which has 1s in the first two cells and 0s elsewhere. That doesn't match because the maximum is 1, so all cells should be 1, but the example shows [1,1]. Hmm, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the maximum value in each cell. So if any cell in the input is non-zero, output is the maximum of that cell's value and the maximum of its row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each row and column and output those, but that seems more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simply the maximum value in the entire input grid. So for any input, output is a grid where every cell is equal to the maximum value in the input grid.\n\nLet me check this against all examples:\n\nExample 1: Input max is 1. Output is [1,1] \u2192 fits.\n\nExample 2: Input max is 2. Output is [2,2,2] \u2192 fits.\n\nExample 3: Input max is 7 \u2192 output is [7] \u2192 fits.\n\nExample 4: Input max is 8 \u2192 output is [8,8,8] \u2192 fits.\n\nSo, the rule is to output a grid where each cell is the maximum value present in the entire input grid.\n\nTherefore, for the test input grid:\n\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nThe maximum value is 4.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided and see if I can spot any patterns or relationships between the inputs and outputs.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput: 1 1\n\nHmm, the output here is a single number, 1, but it's derived from two 1s in the input. Maybe the rule involves counting something or summing certain elements. Let's check other examples first.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput: 2 2 2\n\nAgain, the output is a single number, 2. It seems that each row in the input contributes to the output, but how?\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput: 7\n\nHere, the output is a single number, 7, which is the only non-zero element in the input. This makes me think that the rule might involve counting the number of non-zero elements in the input, but that doesn't fit all examples. Wait, let me check that.\n\nIf I count the non-zero elements in Example 1: 1 (since there's a 1 and two zeros). So if I count them, I get 1, which matches the output. Example 2 has two non-zero elements (2 and 2), but the output is also 2. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe it's the sum of non-zero elements? In Example 1, sum is 1, which matches. Example 2, sum is 4 (2+2), but the output is 2. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the maximum non-zero element?\n\nIn Example 1, the maximum is 1. So that matches the output of 1. In Example 2, the maximum is 2, which matches the output. Example 3, the maximum is 7, which matches the output. Example 4, the maximum is 8, which matches the output. That seems consistent across all examples.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with another hypothetical input. Suppose I have an input where the maximum is 5, then the output should be 5. If I have two 3s, the output should be 3. If I have a single 4, the output is 4. This seems to fit.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Example 4:\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nThe non-zero elements are 8, 8, and 8. The maximum here is 8, so the output should be 8. But wait, the output in Example 4 is 8 8 8 8, which has four elements. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the input.\n\nWait, the input in Example 4 is a 3x3 grid, but the output is 4 elements. That's confusing. Maybe the output grid size is different, or perhaps each row's maximum is considered separately.\n\nWait, no, the output in Example 4 is four elements, but the input has three rows. That doesn't add up. Let me check the input and output again.\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\nOh, wait, the output is four elements because the input has three rows, each contributing a maximum. So each row's maximum is taken, and those are the outputs. So for the first row, max is 8; second row, max is 8; third row, max is 8. So output is [8,8,8].\n\nBut in the example given, the output is 8 8 8 8, which has four elements. That suggests that each row's maximum is taken, and the output has as many elements as the number of rows. Wait, no, because the input is 3x3 and the output is 4 elements. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a single value that's the maximum of all elements in the input. Let's check Example 1: the input elements are 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0. So the maximum is 1, which matches the output. Example 2: elements are 0,2,0,2,0,0,0,2,0. The maximum is 2, which matches. Example 3: elements are 0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Maximum is 7, matches. Example 4: elements are 0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0. Maximum is 8, matches the output which is four 8s? Wait, no, the output in Example 4 is four 8s, but the input is 3x3, which is 9 elements, but the output is four elements. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the output grid size.\n\nWait, in Example 4, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is four elements. That suggests that the output is a single value, not a grid. But in the example, it's written as [|user|><|assistant|>], but the output is four 8s. Wait, no, the output grid is four elements, but the input is 3x3. That's inconsistent. Maybe the output is a single value, but in the example, it's written as four elements. That's confusing.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the examples:\n\nExample 1: Input is 3x3, Output is 1 (a single value).\n\nExample 2: Input is 3x3, Output is 3 (a single value).\n\nExample 3: Input is 3x3, Output is 1 (a single value).\n\nExample 4: Input is 3x3, Output is 4 elements? Or perhaps the output is a single value, and in the example, it's written as four 8s, but that's a mistake. Or maybe the output is a grid of four elements, but in the example, it's written as four 8s, so perhaps the output is a 4x1 grid.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output is the maximum value in the entire input grid, regardless of the number of rows. So for Example 4, the maximum is 8, and the output is a single 8. But in the example, it's written as four 8s. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of all non-zero elements. Let's test:\n\nExample 1: sum is 1 (1 only), matches.\n\nExample 2: sum is 2+2=4, but output is 2, doesn't match.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the minimum of the maximums of each row. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: rows have max 1,1,0. Minimum is 0, but output is 1.\n\nHmm, doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the minimum of all non-zero elements in the input.\n\nExample 1: non-zero elements are 1s, min is 1.\n\nExample 2: non-zero elements are 2 and 2, min is 2.\n\nExample 3: non-zero is 7, min is 7.\n\nExample 4: non-zero elements are 8,8,8,8. Min is 8.\n\nThat fits. So the rule is: find the minimum of all non-zero elements in the input grid.\n\nLet me test this with the hypothetical input I had earlier:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\n\nNon-zero elements are 8,8,8. Min is 8, which would be the output, but the output grid size is four elements, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the output in Example 4 is four 8s, but the input is 3x3. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a single value, which is the minimum of all non-zero elements. So in Example 4, the minimum is 8, which would be the output. But the example shows the output as four 8s, which is different. So perhaps the output is a 4x1 grid, but that doesn't fit the initial examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the maximum of the minimums of each row. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: rows have min 1,1,0. Max is 1.\n\nExample 2: rows have min 2,2,0. Max is 2.\n\nExample 3: min is 7, which is the output.\n\nExample 4: rows have min 8,8,8. Max is 8, which would be the output. But the output is written as four 8s, which is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the maximum of the entire input grid. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: maximum is 1, output is 1.\n\nExample 2: maximum is 2, output is 2.\n\nExample 3: maximum is 7, output is 7.\n\nExample 4: maximum is 8, output is 8.\n\nThat fits. So the rule is to find the maximum value in the entire input grid. The output is that maximum value.\n\nSo in the Example 4 input, the maximum is 8, so the output is 8. But in the example, the output is written as four 8s. That seems inconsistent. Maybe it's a typo, and the output should be 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the maximum per row, and then the output grid is the maximum per row. But then in Example 1, the first two rows have maximum 1, and the third row has 0. So output would be [1,1,0], but the example output is 1.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the output is 1, which suggests that it's just the maximum of the entire grid, not per row.\n\nSo, to clarify, the rule is: the output is the maximum value in the entire input grid.\n\nLet me test this with the examples:\n\nExample 1: max is 1 \u2192 output is 1.\n\nExample 2: max is 2 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nExample 3: max is 7 \u2192 output is 7.\n\nExample 4: max is 8 \u2192 output is 8.\n\nYes, this fits all examples. So the rule is to find the maximum value in the entire input grid.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the given input:\n\nInput:\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nThe non-zero elements are 4,4,4,4. The maximum is 4, so the output is 4.\n\nBut the example expects an output grid of four 8s, which doesn't fit. Wait, no, in the last example, the output is four 8s, but according to the rule, it should be 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules. Let me re-examine the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input is:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\n\nThe non-zero elements are 2,2,2. The maximum is 2, which matches the output of 2. But the output is three 2s, as the input is 3x3.\n\nIn Example 4, the output is four 8s, which is a 4x1 grid, but the input is 3x3. That seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid's size is determined by the number of maximums in the input. Let me check:\n\nExample 1: two 1s, so output is a single 1.\n\nExample 2: three 2s, so output is a single 2.\n\nExample 3: one 7, output is a single 7.\n\nExample 4: three 8s, output is a single 8.\n\nBut in Example 4, the output is written as four 8s, which is confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and the output should be a single 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid where each row contains the maximum of that row, and the output grid is the same size as the input. So for Example 4, output would be a 3x1 grid with 8,8,8. But that doesn't match the example output given.\n\nWait, in Example 4, the output is given as four 8s, which is 4x1. That suggests that the output grid size is different from the input. Maybe the output is a single value, which is the maximum of all elements in the input.\n\nSo, to summarize, the rule is to find the maximum value in the entire input grid. The output is this maximum value.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the given input:\n\nInput:\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nMaximum value is 4, so output is 4.\n\nBut the example expects four 8s, which is confusing. Maybe the output is a 4x1 grid with 8s, but the example shows four 8s as a 4x1 grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid where each row contains the maximum of that row, and the output grid is the same size as the input. So for Example 4, the output would be a 3x3 grid with 8s in each row and column. That would make sense, but the example shows the output as four 8s, which is 4x1.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key rule is that the output is the maximum value in the entire input grid. So for any input, the output is the maximum value.\n\nApplying this to the given input:\n\nThe maximum value is 4, so the output is 4.\n\nBut the example shows the output as four 8s, which is different. Maybe the example is incorrect or I'm misunderstanding the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the maximum per row, and then the output grid is the maximum per row, resulting in a single value. Let's test this:\n\nExample 1: rows have max 1,1,0 \u2192 output is 1.\n\nExample 2: rows have max 2,2,2 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nExample 3: row has max 7 \u2192 output is 7.\n\nExample 4: rows have max 8,8,8 \u2192 output is 8.\n\nBut in Example 4, the output is written as four 8s, which is a 4x1 grid. So perhaps the output is a 4x1 grid, each element being the maximum of each row.\n\nIn that case, for Example 4, the output would be [8,8,8], but the example shows four 8s as a 4x1 grid.\n\nI think the rule is that the output is the maximum value in the entire grid, regardless of the size of the output grid. So the output would be a single value, which is the maximum of all elements in the input.\n\nTherefore, for the given input, the output is 4.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nHmm, in the input, the middle row has a 1, and the output is 1. So it seems like the presence of a 1 in the middle row affects the output. Maybe the rule involves checking the center cell of the grid.\n\nNext, Example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nHere, the input has 2s in the corners, and the output is 2 everywhere. So maybe the rule is that if there's a 2 in any cell, that value is replicated in the output. But wait, in Example 1, the output is 1, which is a 1 in the middle, not a 0. So perhaps the rule is about the center cell.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nHere, the center cell has a 7, and the output is 7. So it seems like the center cell's value directly contributes to the output. But in Example 1, the center cell is 0, yet the output is 1. That contradicts my initial thought. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that only the center cell's value influences the output, and if it's 0 or not present, the output is 0. But in Example 1, the output is 1, so that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the output is the sum of the center cell and any adjacent cells that have a certain value, but that seems too vague.\n\nLooking at Example 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\nAll cells in the output are 8, which is the same as the input's center cell. So perhaps the rule is that the output is the value of the center cell if it's non-zero; otherwise, it's 0. But in Example 1, the output is 1, even though the center is 0. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the output is 1 if the center cell is 1 or greater, and 0 otherwise. But then in Example 2, the output is 2, which doesn't fit. So that can't be it.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the rule is that the output is the sum of all the 1s and 2s in the grid. But in Example 1, the output is 1, which would require the sum to be 1, but there's a 1 in the center. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output is 1 if any cell in the grid is 1, and 0 otherwise. But in Example 1, the output is 1, which fits, but in Example 2, the output is 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the output is the maximum value in the grid. In Example 1, the maximum is 1, which fits the output. In Example 2, the maximum is 2, which fits. In Example 3, the maximum is 7, which fits. In Example 4, the maximum is 8, which fits. So this seems to be a possible rule.\n\nTesting this against all examples:\n\nExample 1: The maximum is 1, output is 1. Correct.\n\nExample 2: The maximum is 2, output is 2. Correct.\n\nExample 3: The maximum is 7, output is 7. Correct.\n\nExample 4: The maximum is 8, output is 8. Correct.\n\nSo the rule is to find the maximum value in the input grid, and that becomes the output grid with a single value equal to that maximum. Therefore, for the test input grid, we need to find the maximum value, which is 8, and the output will be a 1x4 grid with all 8s.\n\nWait, but the test input is 4x4, and the output is a single value, but the user's example for the test input is a 4x4, and the output should be a 4x4 grid with each cell as 8.

There are four examples given, and I need to figure out what rule is being used based on those. Let me start by looking at each example closely and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nHmm, so the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is just two 1s and the rest are 0s. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The output length is shorter than the input. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, no, wait. The input is a 3x3 grid, but the output is 1x2. That doesn't fit either. Maybe the output is a single value, but in this case, it's two values, which is confusing. Perhaps the output is a single number, but it's the sum or product of the input elements. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe the output grid is shorter than the input grid. Let me look at Example 2 to compare.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nThe input is again a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x3 grid. So the output length is 3, same as the input. Now, let's see the output numbers: 2, 2, 2. How could that happen? Let me think about the input values. Looking at each element in the input, maybe it's the maximum value in its row or column.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 1 and 1. Looking at the input, the row with 1 has other zeros, and the column with 1 has other zeros. So perhaps the output is the maximum of the first and last elements of each row or something.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the elements in each row or column. Let me check Example 2. Each row in the input sums to 2: 0+2+0=2, 2+0+0=2, 0+2+0=2. So the output is 2, 2, 2, which matches. Let me check Example 3.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nSo the output is a single number, 7. Now, looking at the input rows, the sum is 7 in the first row, and 0 in the other rows. So perhaps the output is the sum of the elements in each row, and the maximum of those sums across all rows. But in this case, only the first row sums to 7, so the output is 7.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, all rows summed to 2, so the output is 2,2,2. In Example 3, only the first row has a sum, so the output is 7. Now, let's look at Example 4.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\nThe input is 3x3, output is 4x1. Hmm, this is a bit different. Let me see. Each row sum in the input:\n\nFirst row: 0+8+0=8\nSecond row:8+8+0=16\nThird row:8+0+0=8\n\nSo the sums are 8,16,8. The maximum is 16, but the output is 8,8,8,8. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's the maximum of the first and last elements in each row.\n\nFirst row: 0 and 0, so 0\nSecond row:8 and 0, so 8\nThird row:8 and 0, so 8\nSo the output would be 0,8,8, but the actual output is 8,8,8, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum of the two corner elements in each row. Let's check Example 2 again. The corners are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Wait, no, in Example 2, the corners are 0,0 from the top-left and 0,0 from the bottom-right. So the maximum of the corners would be 0, but the output is 2,2,2. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the rule is to take the maximum of the two elements in each row, considering the first and last elements. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1: Each row has a 1 in the middle, but in the first row, it's 0,0,0; second is 1,0,0; third is 0,1,0. So the maximum of each row's first and last elements is 0, 1, 1. But the output is 1 and 1. Wait, but in the output, it's two values, but the input has three rows. Maybe the output is the maximum of each row's first and last elements, so 1 and 1, which matches.\n\nExample 2: Each row's first and last elements are 0,2,0; 2,0,0; 0,2,0. So the maximums are 0,2,0. But the output is 2,2,2. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum of the first and last elements in each row, but then taking the minimum across the rows. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1: 0,0,0; 1,0,0; 0,1,0. Maximums per row: 0,1,1. Min across rows is 0. That doesn't match the output of 1,1.\n\nMaybe it's the sum of the maximums of each row. Let's try that.\n\nExample 1: Sum of maxes 0+1+1=2. But output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the maximum of each row. So 0+1+1=2, but output is 1,1. Still doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum of the first and last elements in each row, and then the output is the sum of these maxima. Let's test.\n\nExample 1: For each row, first and last are 0,0; 1,0; 0,1. Maxes are 0,1,1. Sum is 2. But the output is 1,1, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the output as a vector, and see if each element corresponds to some property of the input.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is two 1s. The input has a single 1. Maybe the rule is to take the sum of the maximum elements in each row, but that doesn't fit with the output length.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the maximum of the first and last elements of each row. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: Max of first and last in each row: 0,1,1. Output is 1,1. Maybe the output is the sum of these maxima, which is 2, but the output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product of the maxes, but 0*1*1=0, not 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the elements in each row, and the output is the sum of the maximums of each row.\n\nExample 1: Rows sum to 0,1,0. Maxes are 0,1,0. Sum is 1. Output is 1,1. Maybe the rule is to take the sum of the maxes and split it into the output grid. But in this case, the sum is 1, and the output is two 1s, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of the first element in each row and the last element in each row, and then the output is the maximum of these values for each column.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nIn Example 1, the first elements are 0,1,0; last elements are 0,0,0. Maxes are 0,1,0. So for each column, the max is 0,0,0. But the output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the maximum of the first and last elements across all rows. Let's see:\n\nFirst elements are 0,1,0; last are 0,0,0. Max across all first elements is 1; across last elements is 0. So perhaps the output is 1 and 0, but the output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of the first and last elements in each row, and then arrange these maxima in order. For Example 1:\n\nRow 1: max(0,0) = 0\nRow 2: max(1,0) = 1\nRow 3: max(0,0) = 0\nSo output would be 0,1,0, but the output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at another example.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nSo the output is just one element, 7. The input has a 7 in the first row, second column. Let's see how the output is derived. The sum of the first row is 7, so perhaps the output is the sum of the first row. That would explain Example 3.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\nLooking at the sum of each row:\nFirst row: 0+8+0=8\nSecond row:8+8+0=16\nThird row:8+0+0=8\nSo the sums are 8,16,8. The output is four 8s. That doesn't fit unless we're taking the minimum of the sums, but the minimum is 8. So maybe the output is the minimum of the sums, but that's 8, which matches. However, the output in Example 4 is four 8s, which doesn't fit if the output is just one value. So this idea doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the maximums of each row. Let's try that.\n\nSum of maxes in each row:\nRow 1: max(0,8,0)=8\nRow 2: max(8,8,0)=8\nRow 3: max(8,0,0)=8\nSum of maxes: 8+8+8=24. But the output is four 8s, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of the first and last elements in each row, and then arrange them in order, which would give 0,7,0 and then 0,0,0, so 0,7,0,0,0. But the output is 7, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the first and last elements in each row, and then take the maximum across all rows. Let's see.\n\nExample 1:\nRow 1: 0+0=0\nRow 2:1+0=1\nRow 3:0+0=0\nMaxima: 0,1,0 \u2192 max is 1.\nSo output is 1, but the output is two 1s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me try another approach. Maybe the output grid is derived by taking the maximum of each column in the input grid. Let's see.\n\nExample 1:\nColumns:\nFirst: 0,1,0 \u2192 max 1\nSecond:0,0,1 \u2192 max 1\nThird:0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\nSo output should be 1,1,0, but the output is 1,1, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the maximum of each column. Let's try.\n\nExample 1:\nColumns sums: 1,1,0 \u2192 total 2, but output is 1,1.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the sum of the maximum of each row. In Example 1, the row sums are 0,1,0, so max is 1. Output is 1,1. That could be a possibility if the output is the sum of the maxima of each row.\n\nBut in Example 4, the row sums are 8,16,8, so the max is 16, but the output is four 8s, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of each row and then arrange them in the output grid. So in Example 1, the row maxima are 0,1,1, so the output is 0,1,1, which doesn't match the output of 1,1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of each column and then arrange them in the output grid. In Example 1, the column maxima are 1,1,0, so output is 1,1,0, but the output is 1,1.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's try to see if the output is a vector where each element is the maximum of the corresponding column in the input grid. For Example 1, the columns are 1,1,0, so the output should be 1,1,0, but the actual output is 1,1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the maximum of each column. Let's see.\n\nExample 1: Column sums as maxima: 1,1,0. Sum is 2, but the output is 1,1.\n\nHmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's check Example 2 again.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nEach row sums to 2, so the output is all 2s. That fits with the idea that the output is the sum of the first element of each row. In this case, each row's first element is 0,2,0, which sum to 2+0+0=2. So the output is 2,2,2.\n\nLet me check if this works for other examples.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nHere, the first element of the first row is 0, which doesn't match the output. Wait, but the output is 7, which is the sum of the first and last elements of the first row, but 0+0=0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the sum of the first and last elements in each row, and then take the maximum of those sums. Let's try.\n\nExample 1:\nRow 1: 0+0=0\nRow 2:1+0=1\nRow 3:0+0=0\nMax sums: 1\nSo output is 1, but the output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nExample 2:\nEach row's sum is 2, so output is 2,2,2. Fits.\n\nExample 3:\nRow 1:0+0=0\nRow 2:0+0=0\nRow 3:0+0=0\nMax sums: 0\nOutput is 7, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, not working. Maybe the rule is to take the sum of the maximum of each row and the sum of the maximum of each column. Let me try.\n\nExample 1:\nSum of row maxima: 1\nSum of column maxima:1\nMaybe output is the product, which is 1. But the output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the output grid is the sum of the input grid's elements in a certain way.\n\nWait, looking at Example 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\nEach row's sum is 8, 16, 8. So the maximum is 16. The output is four 8s, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of the first and last elements of each row and then arrange them in the output grid. For Example 1, the first elements are 0,1,0; last are 0,0,0. So maxes are 0,1,0. The output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of the first element and the last element of each row, and then the output is the sum of these maxima. Let's try.\n\nExample 1: Maxes are 0,1,0. Sum is 1. Output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should accept that the rule is the sum of the maxima of each row, and see if that works for all examples.\n\nExample 1: Row sums are 0,1,0. Maxima 0,1,0. Sum is 1. Output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output is 7, which is the first element of the first row. So maybe the rule is to take the maximum of the first and last elements of each row and then take the maximum of those across all rows.\n\nExample 1: maxes are 0,1,0 \u2192 max is 1. Output is 1,1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of the first element of each row and the last element of each row, and then arrange them in the output. For Example 1:\n\nFirst elements:0,1,0 \u2192 max 1\nLast elements:0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\nSo output would be 1,0, but the output is 1,1. Doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm stuck.

Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Okay, let's try to figure out the rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the examples provided. \n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nSo the output is two 1s. Hmm, maybe it's counting something. The input grid has a 1 in the second row, first column. Could it be the number of 1s in the grid? But wait, the output is 1, which matches the single 1 in the second row, first column. But then in Example 2:\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nHere, the output is three 2s. Let's count the non-zero values in the input. The first row has 2 and 2, which add up to 4, and the second row has 2, so total 5. But the output is 2 for each cell, which doesn't seem to match. Wait, maybe it's the maximum value in each cell. But in the first row, 2 is the max, but in the output, each cell is 2, so that fits. But in Example 1, the second row has a 1, which is the max, but the output is 1. So maybe it's the maximum in each cell. That seems consistent.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nHere, the only non-zero value is 7 in the first row, second column. The output is 7, which matches the maximum.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\nThe input has 8s in various positions. The maximum here is 8, and the output is four 8s, which again matches the maximum.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: For each cell in the grid, the output value is the maximum of the values in that cell. But wait, in Example 1, the output is two 1s, which would mean that the first row's two 1s are set, but the second row's 1 is set as well. But in the input, the second row has a 1 in the first column and 0s elsewhere. So the maximum in that row is 1, and the output is 1. Similarly, the third row's maximum is 1, but in the output, it's 0. Wait, no, in Example 1, the output is 1 1, which has two 1s. But the first row has all 0s, so the maximum is 0, but the output has two 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is the maximum of the corresponding cell across all rows. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 1, each cell in the output is 1, which is the maximum of the cells in that position across all rows. For example, the first row's cells are 0,0,0, so max is 0, but the output is 1. Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe it's not the overall maximum, but the maximum per row.\n\nWait, let's think again. Each output cell is the maximum of the values in that position across all rows. But in Example 1, each output cell is 1, which would mean that for each output cell, the maximum in that column across all rows is 1.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0\nRow 2: 1 0 0\nRow 3: 0 1 0\n\nSo for the first column, the values are 0,1,0, so the maximum is 1, which matches the output 1. Similarly, the second column has 0,0,1, so maximum is 1. The third column is 0,0,0, so maximum is 0, but the output is 1. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the maximum per row. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, each row's maximum:\n\nRow 1: max(0,0,0) = 0\nRow 2: max(1,0,0) = 1\nRow 3: max(0,1,0) = 1\n\nSo the output would be 0,1,1, but the output is 1,1. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of the entire grid, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to count the number of times a cell has a non-zero value or something else.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output is 1,1, which are two 1s. The input has a 1 in the second row, first column, and another 1 in the third row, second column. So maybe the rule is to count the number of 1s in the grid, but that's not matching the other examples.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output is 2,2,2. The input has 0s and 2s. So perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each row and then sum them up or something else.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the maximum values in each row.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 1\nRow 3: 1\nSum: 0+1+1=2, but output is 1,1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value across all the cells, but that doesn't fit because in Example 1, the output is 1,1, but the overall maximum is 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's the count of 1s in the entire grid, but in Example 1, there's only one 1, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has two 2s, so output is 2,2,2, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of each 1 in the grid. For example, in Example 2, the input has two 2s, but the output is 2 for each cell. Maybe it's the maximum value in each cell, but only if it's 1, then the output is 1.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the cells are 0s and 1s, so the output is 1,1, which suggests that the rule is to take the maximum in each cell, but if the cell is 0, the output is 0, but in the output, it's 1 in some cases.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of each row, but if the maximum is 0, then it's 0. But in Example 1, the rows have max 0,1,1, so the output is 1,1, which doesn't fit because the output is two 1s, not 0,1,1.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule is that each output cell is the maximum of the values in that cell across all rows. Let's test that.\n\nFor Example 1:\n\nEach cell's maximum across rows:\n\nFirst cell: max(0,1,0) = 1\nSecond cell: max(0,0,1) = 1\nThird cell: max(0,0,0) = 0\n\nSo output should be 1,1,0, but the actual output is 1,1, which doesn't match because the third cell is 0.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So maybe the rule isn't per cell, but per row. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nEach row's maximum:\n\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 1\nRow 3: 1\nSo the output is 0,1,1. But the actual output is 1,1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in each column. Let's try that.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nEach column's maximum:\n\nFirst column: max(0,1,0) = 1\nSecond column: max(0,0,1) = 1\nThird column: max(0,0,0) = 0\nSo output would be 1,1,0, which doesn't match the actual output of 1,1.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not columns.\n\nWait, another idea: The output is the maximum of the entire grid. For Example 1, the maximum is 1, so each cell is 1. But in the output, it's 1,1, which is two 1s. So that would fit, but in Example 2, the grid has 2s and 0s. The maximum is 2, so the output would be four 2s, but the actual output is three 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum of each row. So in Example 1:\n\nRow 1: max(0,0,0) = 0\nRow 2: max(1,0,0) = 1\nRow 3: max(0,1,0) = 1\nSo output is 0,1,1. But actual output is 1,1, which doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 4, the output is four 8s. The input has 8s in various positions. Maybe the rule is to take the maximum of each cell, but if it's 0, it's 0, otherwise, it's the maximum. But in Example 1, the output is 1,1, which would mean that in the first and second columns, the maximum is 1, and in the third column, it's 0. But the actual output is 1,1,0, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the maximums per row. Let's try that.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nSum of max per row: 0 +1 +1 =2. But the output is 1,1, which has two 1s. So sum of 2 doesn't match.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nSum of max per row: 0 (row1) +2 (row2) +2 (row3) =4. But output is 2,2,2, sum 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of non-zero cells in each column. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nFirst column has 1 non-zero cell (row2), second column has 1 non-zero cell (row3), third column has 0. So output is 1,1,0, but actual output is 1,1, which doesn't fit.\n\nI'm not making progress. Maybe I'll try to think of another approach. Perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each cell, but if it's 0, it's set to 1. But in Example 1, the cells are 0 and 1, so the output would be 1,1, which matches. In Example 2, the cells are 0,2,0 and 2,0,0 and 0,2,0. The max in each cell is 2, so the output would be 2,2,2, which matches. Example 3: The cells are 0,7,0 and 0,0,0 and 0,0,0. The max is 7, so output is 7, which matches. Example 4: The cells are 0,8,0; 8,8,0; 8,0,0. Max in each cell is 8, so output is 8,8,8, which matches. So maybe the rule is: for each cell, if it's 0, set it to 1; else, it's the maximum value across the grid.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output is 1,1, which would mean that the max was 1, but in the grid, there are 0s. So perhaps the rule is that the output cell is the maximum of the entire grid, but only if the maximum is 1, else 0. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nThe grid has 0s and 1. The max is 1, so output is 1,1.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nThe grid has 0s and 2. Max is 2, which is greater than 1, so output is 2,2,2.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nMax is 7, which is greater than 1, so output is 7.\n\nIn Example 4:\n\nMax is 8, which is greater than 1, so output is 8,8,8.\n\nYes, that fits all examples. So the rule is to take the maximum value across the entire grid. For each cell, if the maximum value is 1, set the output to 1; else, set it to the maximum value.\n\nWait, no, because in Example 1, the maximum is 1, so output is 1,1. In Example 2, maximum is 2, so output is 2,2,2. In Example 3, maximum is 7, output is 7. In Example 4, maximum is 8, output is 8,8,8. So the rule is: for each cell, the output is the maximum of the entire grid if the maximum is greater than 0, else 0. But in the examples, the outputs are either 1,1 or 2,2 or 7,7, etc. So perhaps the rule is: output is 1 if the maximum is 1, else it's the maximum value. Wait, but in Example 2, the maximum is 2, so output is 2,2,2.\n\nAlternatively, the rule is: for each cell, the output is the maximum value from the grid, but if that maximum is 0, it's set to 0. Otherwise, it's set to 1. But that doesn't fit because in Example 1, the output is 1,1, which would be correct if the maximum is 1. But in Example 2, the maximum is 2, so output is 2, but the output is 2,2,2, so yes, that fits.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: for each cell, the output is the maximum of the entire grid if that maximum is 1, else it's the maximum value. Wait, but in Example 1, the maximum is 1, so output is 1,1. In Example 2, maximum is 2, so output is 2,2,2. Example 3: maximum is 7, output is 7. Example 4: maximum is 8, output is 8,8,8. So that seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, what if the grid has a maximum of 0? For example, all cells are 0. Then the output should be 0,0,0.\n\nSo the rule is: for each cell, the output is the maximum value from the entire grid if that maximum is greater than 0, else 0.\n\nBut let me test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\nMaximum is 1, so each output cell is 1. Output is [1,1].\nExample 2:\nMaximum is 2, so each output cell is 2. Output is [2,2,2].\nExample 3:\nMaximum is 7, so output is [7].\nExample 4:\nMaximum is 8, so output is [8,8,8].\n\nYes, that fits.\n\nSo, the rule is: compute the maximum value of the entire grid. Then, for each cell, if the maximum is 0, output 0; else, set each cell to the maximum value.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output is two 1s, which is correct. In the third example, output is one 7. So yes.\n\nSo, applying this rule, the output grid will have each cell set to the maximum value of the entire input grid, unless the maximum is 0, in which case all cells are 0.\n\nSo, for the input grid in Example 3:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nThe maximum is 7, so output is [7].\n\nIn Example 4:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nThe maximum is 8, so output is [8,8,8].\n\nSo, now, applying this rule to the provided test input grid.\n\nTest Input Grid:\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nFirst, compute the maximum value in this grid. Looking at the values:\n\n4,4,0\n4,0,4\n0,0,4\n\nThe maximum value is 4.\n\nSo, the output grid will be a 3x3 grid where each cell is 4, unless the maximum is 0, which it's not here.\n\nSo, the output grid is:\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are four examples given, and I need to find a pattern or rule that applies across all of them. Then, I'll have to use that rule to predict the output for a new test input grid.\n\nLet me start by looking at each example one by one to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput: 1 1\n\nHmm, the output is two 1s. Let me see what's going on here. Looking at the input, I notice that there's a 1 in the center, and the other cells are mostly zeros. In the output, only the cell that corresponds to the 1 in the center is getting a 1. So maybe the rule is to count the number of 1s in each row and column, but that seems a bit unclear. Or perhaps it's related to the number of non-zero elements in each row or column.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of 1s in each row. Let's check. The first row has one 1, the second row also has one 1, and the third row has one 1. But the output is 1 1, which has two 1s. That doesn't add up. Maybe it's the number of non-zero elements in each row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the sum of the corresponding cells in the input grid. But that doesn't seem right because in Example 1, the input is 1 in the center, and the output is 1, but the other cells are zero. Wait, but the output is a single 1. Maybe it's about the diagonal elements?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the output is the count of 1s in the corresponding row and column where the input has a value. Hmm, that might be too vague.\n\nLet me check Example 2.\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput: 2 2 2\n\nSo each row has two non-zero elements, both 2s. The output is three 2s. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the input has a 2 in each row, but the output is a single 2. Maybe it's the minimum of the row and column sums.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the rule is that each output cell is the maximum of the input cells in that row or column. For Example 1, the center cell is 1, and the output is 1. For Example 2, each row has two 2s, and the output is 2. For Example 3, there's a 7 in the top left, and the output is 7. Example 4 has a 8 in some cells and the output is 8.\n\nWait, that seems to fit. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1, the center cell is 1, which becomes 1 in the output. The other cells in the output are 1 and 1, but in the input, they are 0. So maybe the output is the maximum between the input cell and zero? No, that doesn't fit because in Example 2, the output is 2, which is the maximum of 2 in each row.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the minimum of the maximum of each row and each column. Alternatively, maybe it's the minimum non-zero value in the grid.\n\nWait, let's see. For Example 1, the only non-zero cell is 1, so output is 1. For Example 2, each row has two 2s, so output is 2. Example 3 has a single 7, so output is 7. Example 4, all cells are 8, so output is 8.\n\nWait, that seems to fit. So the rule is to find the minimum non-zero value in the entire grid. But in Example 1, the grid is mostly zeros except for one 1, so the minimum is 1. In Example 2, each row has two 2s, but there are no non-zero values less than 2 elsewhere, so output is 2. In Example 3, the grid is 7, which is non-zero, so output is 7. In Example 4, all are 8, so output is 8.\n\nSo the rule is: the output is the minimum non-zero value in the input grid. Now, let me test this with the test input grid provided.\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\nOutput: ?\n\nSince all the cells are non-zero and the minimum is 4, the output should be four 4s. But wait, the output should be a grid of the same size as the input, so three rows, each with three cells. So the output should be:\n\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n\nBut wait, in the examples, the outputs are sometimes a single value or all values same. So yes, the rule seems to be that the output is the minimum non-zero value in the input grid.\n\nSo applying this to the test input grid, each cell is 4 or higher, so the minimum is 4, so the output is a 3x3 grid of 4s.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The first row has all zeros except maybe the second element, which is also zero. The second row has a 1, and the third row has a 1. So, the output seems to be the count of 1s in each row or something like that.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput: 2 2 2\nHere, each row has two non-zero elements. The output is 2 for all three rows. That seems consistent. So, maybe the output is the number of non-zero elements in each row, divided by two or something. Wait, but in the first row, there are two non-zero elements (2 and 2), so maybe it's 2. That fits.\n\nIn Example 3:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput: 7\nHere, only the first row has a non-zero element (7), so the output is 7. That makes sense.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput: 8 8 8 8\nEach row has non-zero elements. Let's count: first row has one 8, second has two, third has none. Wait, but the output is all 8s. Hmm, maybe it's the minimum number of non-zero elements in each row. Or perhaps the maximum. Wait, in the first row, there's one 8; second row has two; third row has zero. The minimum is zero, but that doesn't match. Wait, maybe it's the sum of non-zero elements divided by something. Alternatively, perhaps it's the count of non-zero elements across all rows divided by the number of rows, but that might not work.\n\nWait, looking again, in Example 4, the output is 8 for each cell in the output grid. The input has four 8s. So, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum number of non-zero elements in any row. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, two non-zero elements per row, so max is 2, but output is 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of non-zero elements divided by the number of rows. In Example 1, two non-zero elements per row, sum is 2, divided by 3 rows gives 0.666, which doesn't match 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the maximum number of non-zero elements in any single row. In Example 1, two non-zero elements, so max is 2, but output is 1. That's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of non-zero elements in each row, and then take the average. In Example 1, each row has two, so sum is 6, divided by 3 rows gives 2. But output is 1. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of non-zero elements in each row, but divided by 2. So, in Example 1, sum is 6, divided by 2 is 3, but output is 1. That's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the minimum number of non-zero elements in any row. In Example 1, two non-zero elements per row, so the minimum is 2, but output is 1. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of non-zero elements, divided by the number of non-zero elements. In Example 1, two non-zero elements per row, so sum is 6, divided by 2 is 3, but output is 1. Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of non-zero elements in each row, divided by the number of rows. So, for Example 1, sum is 6, divided by 3 is 2, but output is 1. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of non-zero elements in each row, but divided by the number of rows, then multiplied by something. I'm not getting it.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 4 again. The input has four 8s. The output is four 8s. So, maybe the rule is to take the sum of all non-zero elements and divide by the total number of elements. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1: sum is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2. Total elements are 9. 2/9 is about 0.222, which doesn't match output of 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of non-zero elements in each row, divided by the number of non-zero elements in that row. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1: each row has two non-zero elements. Sum is 1+0+0 (second row) and 0+1+0 (third row). So, each row's sum is 1. So output is 1. That fits.\n\nIn Example 2: each row has two non-zero elements. Sum is 2+0+0 (second row) and 0+2+0 (third row). Each row's sum is 2, so output is 2. That fits.\n\nIn Example 3: first row has one non-zero element, sum is 7. So output is 7. That fits.\n\nIn Example 4: each row has one non-zero element. Sum is 8 in first row, 8 in second, 8 in third. So output is 8. That fits.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row, sum the non-zero elements in that row, and that's the output for that row.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input grid:\n\nInput:\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nFirst row: 4 + 4 + 0 = 8\nSecond row: 4 + 0 + 4 = 8\nThird row: 0 + 0 + 4 = 4\n\nSo, the output grid should be:\n8 8 4\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or similarities.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput: 1 1\n\nHmm, the output seems to be a single number, but the input has a 1 in the center. Maybe the rule is something to do with the center or some specific cell.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput: 2 2 2\n\nHere, all the non-zero cells in the corners have a 2, and the output is 2 for each non-zero. But wait, the output is a single number, so maybe it's counting something, like the number of non-zero cells or the sum.\n\nWait, the output is 2 2 2 in the first example, but in Example 2, it's also 2. Maybe the rule is that each output cell corresponds to a specific cell in the input grid, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput: 7\n\nHere, the only non-zero cell is 7 in the first row, second column, and the output is just 7. So maybe the rule is that each output cell is determined by a specific rule, but in this case, the output is just the value of that particular cell.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput: 8 8 8 8\n\nThe output is a single number, but the input has multiple non-zero cells. Maybe the rule is that each output cell is the maximum value in a certain region or something like that.\n\nWait, let's try to see if the rule is related to the number of times a certain value appears in a diagonal or anti-diagonal. For Example 1, the center cell is 1, and the output is 1. In Example 2, the corners have 2s, and the output is 2. In Example 3, the center cell is 7, and the output is 7. In Example 4, the maximum value is 8, and the output is 8.\n\nAh, I think the rule is that each output cell corresponds to a specific pattern in the input grid. For the first example, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the value of the smallest diagonal cell in a certain direction. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the diagonals.\n\nWait, maybe it's the minimum value along each diagonal. Let's test that.\n\nExample 1:\nThe main diagonal (0,0;1,1;2,2) has values 0,1,0. The minimum is 0. But the output is 1, so that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the maximum value along each diagonal. In Example 1, the maximum along the main diagonal is 1, which matches the output of 1.\n\nIn Example 2, all non-zero cells are 2, so the maximum is 2, which matches the output.\n\nExample 3, the maximum is 7, but the output is 7, so that fits.\n\nExample 4, the maximum is 8, and the output is 8, so that works too.\n\nSo, the rule is that each output cell is the maximum value along a specific diagonal. But how do we determine which diagonal to take?\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that each output cell corresponds to a specific diagonal. For instance, in Example 1, the output is 1, which comes from the maximum of the main diagonal, which is 0,1,0, so the maximum is 1.\n\nIn Example 2, the output is 2, which comes from the maximum of each diagonal line in the input grid. Since all the non-zero cells are 2, the maximum is 2.\n\nIn Example 3, the output is 7, which is the maximum of the main diagonal.\n\nIn Example 4, the output is 8, which is the maximum of the main diagonal.\n\nSo, the rule is that each output cell is the maximum value along a diagonal that starts from the top-left corner and goes to the bottom-right corner. So, for each cell in the input grid, the output is the maximum value along the diagonal that starts from the top-left and passes through that cell.\n\nTherefore, for the test input grid:\n\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nWe need to find the maximum values along each diagonal starting from the top-left. Let's list the diagonals:\n\n1. Starting at (0,0): 4,4,4 \u2192 max is 4\n2. Starting at (0,1): 4,0,0 \u2192 max is 4\n3. Starting at (1,0): 4,0,4 \u2192 max is 4\n4. Starting at (2,0): 0,0,4 \u2192 max is 4\n\nWait, but the output is a single number, so perhaps each diagonal corresponds to a row in the output grid. But the input has 3 rows and 3 columns, so the output would have 3 rows and 3 columns as well. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in the test input grid, the output should be a 3x3 grid, but the rule is that each output cell is the maximum of a diagonal starting from the top-left. So, for each cell, the output is the maximum of all diagonals that pass through it.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe each output cell is determined by the maximum along the diagonal that starts from the top-left and ends at that cell.\n\nFor example, cell (0,0) is the start, so its output is the maximum along that diagonal, which is 4,4,4 \u2192 max is 4.\n\nCell (0,1): the diagonal starts at (0,0) and includes (0,1), (1,1), (2,1). The values are 4,0,0 \u2192 max is 4.\n\nCell (0,2): diagonal starts at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2). Values are 4,0,0,4,4 \u2192 max is 4.\n\nSimilarly, cell (1,0): diagonal starts at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0). Values are 4,4,0 \u2192 max is 4.\n\nCell (1,1): diagonal starts at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). Values are 4,0,4 \u2192 max is 4.\n\nCell (1,2): diagonal starts at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). Values are 4,0,4 \u2192 max is 4.\n\nCell (2,0): diagonal starts at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0). Values are 4,4,0 \u2192 max is 4.\n\nCell (2,1): diagonal starts at (0,0), (1,1), (2,1). Values are 4,0,0 \u2192 max is 4.\n\nCell (2,2): diagonal starts at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). Values are 4,0,4 \u2192 max is 4.\n\nSo, the output grid would be:\n\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n\nWait, but that doesn't match the previous examples where the output was a single number. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rule.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output is a single number, not a grid. So maybe the rule is that the output is the maximum of the entire grid, but in that case, it would be 1, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell corresponds to the maximum of a diagonal that starts from the top-left and ends at that cell. So, for each cell (i,j), the value is the maximum along the diagonal from (0,0) to (i,j).\n\nIn that case, the output grid would have each cell as the maximum of the diagonal from (0,0) to that cell.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n(0,0): max is 4\n(0,1): max is 4 (since (0,1) is 4 and (1,1) is 0)\n(0,2): max is 4 (since (0,2) is 4, (1,2) is 4, (2,2) is 4)\n(1,0): max is 4 (since (1,0) is 4 and (2,0) is 0)\n(1,1): max is 4 (since (1,1) is 0, (2,1) is 0, (2,2) is 4)\n(1,2): max is 4 (since (1,2) is 4, (2,2) is 4)\n(2,0): max is 4 (since (2,0) is 0, (1,0) is 4, (0,0) is 4)\n(2,1): max is 4 (since (2,1) is 0, (1,1) is 0, (0,0) is 4)\n(2,2): max is 4\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because Example 1's output is 1, which is the maximum of the diagonal (0,0;1,1;2,2) which is (0,0)=0, (1,1)=1, (2,2)=0 \u2192 max is 1.\n\nSimilarly, Example 2's output is 2, which is the max of the diagonals (0,2)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,0)=2 \u2192 max is 2.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the maximum value along the diagonal starting from (0,0) to that cell. If that's the case, then the output grid would have each cell as the maximum along that diagonal.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input grid:\n\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nWe need to compute the maximum for each diagonal from (0,0) to each cell.\n\nFor (0,0): max is 4\n(0,1): max is max(4,4,0) \u2192 4\n(0,2): max is max(4,4,4) \u21924\n(1,0): max is max(4,4,0) \u21924\n(1,1): max is max(4,0,4,0) \u21924\n(1,2): max is max(4,0,4,4) \u21924\n(2,0): max is max(4,4,0) \u21924\n(2,1): max is max(4,0,0,0) \u21924\n(2,2): max is max(4,0,4,4) \u21924\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the test input grid, all the non-zero cells are 4, so the output would be 4 for all cells, but the rule was that each output cell is the maximum along the diagonal from (0,0) to that cell.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input's (1,1) is 1, and the diagonals were 0,1,0, so the maximum is 1, which is the output.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the diagonals from (0,0) to each cell are:\n\n- (0,0): 0\n- (0,1): 2\n- (0,2): 2\n- (1,0):4\n- (1,1):2\n- (1,2):4\n- (2,0):0\n- (2,1):2\n- (2,2):2\n\nWait, that's not matching the examples. Maybe the rule is that each output cell is the maximum value along the anti-diagonal, which starts at (0,2) and moves towards (2,0).\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n\nAnti-diagonals:\n(0,2):0\n(1,1):0\n(2,0):0\n\nWait, the output is 1, not 0, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output cell is the minimum value along the diagonal starting from (0,0).\n\nIn Example 1, the diagonals are 0,1,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0. The minimum is 0, but the output is 1, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the maximum value in the row or column from (0,0) to that cell.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the maximum value in the entire grid. But in that case, the output would be 4, which doesn't match the examples.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each output cell is the maximum value in a diagonal that starts from the top-left and goes to that cell, but if there's a non-zero cell in that diagonal, the output is the maximum of that diagonal.\n\nWait, that might be it. So for each cell (i,j), the output is the maximum of all the cells in the diagonal from (0,0) to (i,j).\n\nLet's test that with Example 1.\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n\nThe diagonals from (0,0) to each cell:\n\n- (0,0): 0\n- (0,1): 0 (since input is 0 and 0)\n- (0,2): 0\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,1): 0 (max of 1 and 0)\n- (1,2): 0 (max of 1,0)\n- (2,0): 0\n- (2,1): 0 (max of 0,1)\n- (2,2): 0 (max of 0,1)\n\nBut the output is 1, which would correspond to cell (1,0). So that fits.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\n\nThe diagonals from (0,0):\n\n- (0,0):0\n- (0,1):2\n- (0,2):2\n- (1,0):2\n- (1,1):0\n- (1,2):0\n- (2,0):0\n- (2,1):2\n- (2,2):2\n\nThe maximum along each diagonal is 2, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nThe diagonals from (0,0):\n\n- (0,0):0\n- (0,1):7\n- (0,2):7\n- (1,0):0\n- (1,1):0\n- (1,2):0\n- (2,0):0\n- (2,1):0\n- (2,2):0\n\nThe maximum is 7, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\n\nThe diagonals from (0,0):\n\n- (0,0):0\n- (0,1):8\n- (0,2):8\n- (1,0):8\n- (1,1):8\n- (1,2):0\n- (2,0):8\n- (2,1):0\n- (2,2):0\n\nThe maximum is 8, which matches the output.\n\nSo the rule is that each output cell (i,j) is the maximum value along the diagonal starting from (0,0) to (i,j). If there's a non-zero cell in that diagonal, the output is the maximum; if all are zero, it's zero. But in the examples, the output is always a positive number, so perhaps the rule is that the output is the maximum value along the diagonal from (0,0) to (i,j).\n\nTherefore, for the test input grid:\n\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nWe need to compute the maximum for each diagonal from (0,0):\n\n- (0,0):4\n- (0,1):4 (since (0,1) is 4)\n- (0,2):4 (max of 4,4,0)\n- (1,0):4 (max of 4,4,0)\n- (1,1):0 (max of 4,0,0)\n- (1,2):4 (max of 4,0,4)\n- (2,0):4 (max of 4,4,0)\n- (2,1):4 (max of 4,0,0)\n- (2,2):4 (max of 4,0,4)\n\nWait, but that would make the output grid a 3x3 grid where each cell is the maximum along its diagonal. So the output would be:\n\n4 4 4\n4 0 4\n4 4 4\n\nWait, but in the test input grid, the output should be a 3x3 grid where each cell is the maximum along its diagonal from (0,0).

There are four examples provided, each with an input grid and an output grid. My task is to understand the pattern or rule used in the examples and then apply it to a test input grid to predict the output.\n\nLet me start by looking at each example carefully.\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput: 1 1\n\nHmm, so the input grid has a 1 in the center and zeros around it. The output is just 1 1. That's interesting. It doesn't seem like any simple arithmetic operation like adding up the numbers or taking the maximum or minimum would work here. Maybe it's something to do with the positions of the non-zero values.\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput: 2 2 2\n\nHere, the input grid has 2s in the top-left and bottom-right corners. The output is 2 in all three positions. So again, it's not just taking a single value from the input. Maybe it's about the maximum value in the grid.\n\n**Example 3:**\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput: 7\n\nOnly the center cell has a 7. The output is 7. So this suggests that the output is the maximum value in the grid. But wait, in Example 1, there's a 1 in the center, and the output is 1, which would align with the maximum approach.\n\n**Example 4:**\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput: 8 8 8 8\n\nHere, the input grid has multiple 8s, but the output is all 8s. So again, it seems like the maximum value in the grid is being taken.\n\nPutting this all together, the rule appears to be: For each grid, find the maximum value among all the elements in the grid. That value becomes the output for the corresponding position.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid:\n\nTest Input Grid:\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nAll the non-zero elements are 4, and the highest value is 4. So the output grid should be all 4s.\n\nWait, but in the test input, the last column has a 0 in the third row. So the maximum is still 4. So the output would be:\n\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n\nBut looking back at the examples, sometimes the output has fewer elements. For example, Example 1 outputs two 1s, which correspond to the two 1s in the input. So perhaps the output is a single-element grid if the input grid is 1x1, but in this case, the input is 3x3. So maybe the output is a grid of the same size, but filled with the maximum of each corresponding position. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each position is independent.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each row or column? Or perhaps the output is a single value if the grid is 1x1, but in this case, all the non-zero values are 4, so the output should be 4 in each position.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The test input grid is:\n\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nEach cell has a 4 or 0. The maximum value is 4, so the output should be a grid where each cell is the maximum of that cell's value across the grid. Wait, but that would mean each cell in the output would be 4. So the output would be:\n\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is two 1s, each corresponding to the 1 in the input grid. So the output is a single value, which is the maximum of the entire grid. But in Example 2, the output is three 2s, each corresponding to the cells with 2s. Example 3 outputs a single 7. Example 4 outputs all 8s.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a grid where each position is the maximum value of that particular cell across all input grids. But that doesn't make sense because each input grid can be different. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the maximum value of each individual cell across all input grids, but that's not applicable here since we're given one input grid and one output grid.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a grid where each cell is the maximum value of that particular cell across all input grids. But since the test input is one grid, the output would be the maximum of each cell in that grid.\n\nWait, no, that's not the case. Let me think again. The rule, as per the examples, is that for each grid, the output is the maximum value of all the cells in the grid. So for the test input, each cell is either 4 or 0, so the maximum is 4. Therefore, the output grid will be all 4s.\n\nBut let me check the test input:\n\nIt's:\n\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nSo, the maximum value is 4, so each cell in the output grid should be 4.\n\nTherefore, the output grid would be:\n\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n\nSo, the output is a 3x3 grid filled with 4s.\n\nWait, but in the test input, the last row has three cells: 0, 0, 4. So the maximum is 4. So all cells in the output grid should be 4.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The input has 1s in the second and third rows. Maybe the rule is related to the presence of 1s in the input. But I notice that the first row of input is all 0s, and the others have 1s. The output only has 1s. Maybe it's when there's a 1 in a particular position, but I need more examples to confirm.\n\nMoving to Example 2:\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput: 2 2 2\n\nHere, all the non-zero entries are 2s, and the output is 2s. It seems like the rule might be multiplying by 2 when the input has non-zero values. But I should check if this holds for other examples.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput: 7\n\nOnly a single non-zero value (7) in the input, and the output is 7.

So maybe it's the maximum non-zero value in the input. That makes sense because in the first example, the maximum 1 is present, and the output is 1. In all other examples, the maximum is that number.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with another example. Suppose I have an input where maximum is 3, should the output be 3. If I have a grid with 2 and 3, the output would be 3. That seems consistent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule is: For each cell in the output, take the maximum value in the corresponding cells of all input grids. Wait, no, that can't be right because in the first example, the output is 1, but in the second example, it's 2, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum value across all inputs. Let me check. In Example 1, the input has a 1, and the output is 1. In Example 2, the inputs have 2s, and the output is 2. Example 3: input has 7, output is 7. Example 4: inputs have 8s, output is 8. So yes, it seems that the output is the maximum value present in the input grid.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the output is 2. The input has 2s, which are higher than 0s. So the maximum is indeed 2, and the output is 2. Similarly, in Example 3, the maximum is 7, and the output is 7.\n\nSo, the rule is to find the maximum value in each row of the input grid, and that will be the corresponding row in the output grid. Wait, no, that doesn't fit all examples because in Example 1, the output is two 1s. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each output cell, the value is the maximum of all the corresponding cells in the input grid. Let's test this:\n\nIn Example 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nFor each cell in output, the maximum of the corresponding cells in the input. Let's look at each position:\n\nOutput cell 1: maximum of (0,1,0) \u2192 1\nOutput cell 2: maximum of (0,0,1) \u2192 1\nSo output is 1 1, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2:\nInput has 2s in some cells. The maximum in each row of the input is 2 (since rows are [0,2,0], [2,0,0], [0,2,0]. So each row's max is 2, but the output is 2 2 2. That fits because each cell's max is 2.\n\nIn Example 3:\nInput has a 7 in one cell, the rest are 0. The max in each row is 7, so output is 7.\n\nIn Example 4:\nThe input has 8s and 0s. Each row's max is 8, so output is 8 8 8 8.\n\nSo yes, the rule is that for each output cell, the value is the maximum of all the input cells in that position across all rows. Or wait, no. Because in Example 1, the output is 1 1, which suggests that each output cell is the maximum of the input cells in the corresponding row. Wait, no, because in Example 1, output has two 1s, which are the maximum of the first and third rows of the input. So, for each row in the output, the value is the maximum of the cells in that row of the input grid.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIn Example 1, the output has two cells. Each cell corresponds to the maximum of a row in the input. So, for the first two rows, the max is 1 and 0, but the output is 1 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe each output cell is the maximum of the entire input grid. In Example 1, the maximum is 1, but the output is two 1s. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the maximum of the non-zero cells in each column. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the non-zero cells are in the second and third rows, so max is 1. The output is 1 1, which fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the non-zero cells are in the first, second, and third rows. The maximum is 2. The output is 2 2 2, which fits.\n\nIn Example 3, only one non-zero cell, so output is 7.\n\nIn Example 4, multiple non-zero cells, but the maximum is 8. The output is 8 8 8 8, which fits.\n\nWait, that seems to hold. So the rule is: For each column in the output grid, the value is the maximum of the non-zero cells in that column across all rows of the input grid.\n\nBut let me check this.\n\nIn Example 1:\nColumns:\nColumn 1: 0 (row1), 1 (row2), 0 (row3) \u2192 max is 1\nColumn 2: 0, 0, 1 \u2192 max is 1\nSo output is 1 1.\n\nIn Example 2:\nColumns:\nColumn 1: 0, 2, 0 \u2192 max 2\nColumn 2: 2, 0, 2 \u2192 max 2\nColumn 3: 0, 0, 0 \u2192 max 0\nBut the output is 2 2 2, which doesn't match. Wait, that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me re-examine Example 2.\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\n\nSo, columns are:\nColumn 1: 0, 2, 0 \u2192 max 2\nColumn 2: 2, 0, 2 \u2192 max 2\nColumn 3: 0, 0, 0 \u2192 max 0\n\nBut the output is 2 2 2. So according to this, each column's max should be 2, 2, and 0. But the output is 2, 2, 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the output grid. Let me look at the examples again.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output is 2 2 2. So each output cell is 2, regardless of the columns. That suggests that the output is a single value, not a grid with multiple values. Wait, but in Example 1, the output is two 1s, which is a grid with two values. So perhaps the output is a grid where each cell is the maximum of the non-zero cells in that column of the input.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output is 2 2 2, which would imply that each column's max is 2, 2, and 2. Let's see:\n\nColumn 1: 0, 2, 0 \u2192 max 2\nColumn 2: 2, 0, 2 \u2192 max 2\nColumn 3: 0, 0, 0 \u2192 max 0\n\nBut the output is 2 2 2, which doesn't match. So perhaps the rule is that the output is the maximum of all the cells in the input grid. In Example 1, the maximum is 1, and the output is two 1s. That doesn't make sense because the output should have the same number of cells as the input.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a single value representing the maximum of the entire input grid. But in Example 1, the maximum is 1, and the output has two 1s, which suggests that the output is the maximum of each row, not the entire grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid where each cell is the maximum of the corresponding row in the input grid. But in Example 1, the output is two 1s, which would correspond to the max of the first and third rows being 1, and the second row being 0. That doesn't fit because the output is 1 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a grid where each cell is the maximum of the corresponding column in the input grid. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1:\nColumns:\nCol1: 0,1,0 \u2192 max 1\nCol2: 0,0,1 \u2192 max 1\nSo output is 1 1, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2:\nColumns:\nCol1: 0,2,0 \u2192 max 2\nCol2: 2,0,2 \u2192 max 2\nCol3: 0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\nBut the output is 2 2 2, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the output is the maximum of the entire input grid, but in Example 1, the maximum is 1, and the output is two 1s, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the maximum of the non-zero cells in each row. Let's try:\n\nIn Example 1:\nRow 1: 0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\nRow 2:1,0,0 \u2192 max 1\nRow 3:0,1,0 \u2192 max 1\nSo output is 1 1, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2:\nRow 1:0,2,0 \u2192 max 2\nRow 2:2,0,0 \u2192 max 2\nRow 3:0,2,0 \u2192 max 2\nOutput is 2 2 2, which matches.\n\nIn Example 3:\nRow 1:0,7,0 \u2192 max 7\nOutput is 7, which matches.\n\nIn Example 4:\nRows have multiple non-zero values, all with 8, so output is 8 8 8 8.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all the examples. So the rule is: For each row in the input grid, the output for that row is the maximum of the non-zero values in that row.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output is 1 1, which corresponds to each row's max. In Example 2, each row's max is 2, 2, 2, so the output is 2 2 2.\n\nIn Example 3, the max is 7, so output is 7.\n\nIn Example 4, each row's max is 8, so output is 8 8 8 8.\n\nSo the rule is: For each row in the input grid, the corresponding row in the output grid is the maximum of the non-zero values in that row of the input.\n\nTherefore, to predict the output grid, for each row in the input, find the maximum value among the non-zero values in that row, and that becomes the corresponding row in the output.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid provided:\n\nTest Input Grid:\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nSo, each row is:\nRow 1: 4,4,0 \u2192 non-zero values 4 and 4. Max is 4.\nRow 2:4,0,4 \u2192 non-zero values 4 and 4. Max is 4.\nRow 3:0,0,4 \u2192 non-zero value 4. Max is 4.\n\nTherefore, the output grid is:\n4\n4\n4\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense with the rule. Each row's max is 4, so the output is three rows of 4.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So the rule seems to be: find the maximum value in each row, and the output is a row of those maximum values.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output is just one number, which is the maximum of the first row.

Both outputs are 1. That suggests that the rule might be related to identifying some kind of presence or count in the input grid. Maybe something like checking if there's a 1 in a position, and if so, output 1; otherwise, 0. But in this case, the output is 1 1, which might imply that there are two 1s in the input grid, but that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nHere, the output is 2 2 2, which is three 2s. The input has 0, 2, and 2 in it. So maybe the rule is to sum the non-zero values or something similar. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example 3:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nThe output is 7, which is the only non-zero value in the input. So that fits with the idea of summing non-zero values.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\nThe output is 8 8 8 8, which has four 8s. Let's see the input. There are two 8s in the first row, two in the second row, and two in the third row. Wait, no, the first row has 0,8,0; second 8,8,0; third 8,0,0. So the non-zero values are 8 in the first row, then 8,8 in the second, and 8 in the third. So adding them up: 8 + 8 + 8 = 24. But the output is 8 8 8 8, which is four 8s. That doesn't match. Maybe it's the maximum value in the grid.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output is 7, which is the maximum in that input. In Example 2, the maximum is 2, but the output is 2, but it's a grid of 3. Wait, no, the output is 2 2 2, which are three values. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Maybe it's the maximum in each row or something.\n\nWait, in Example 4, the input is a 3x4 grid, and the output is a 4-element grid. So perhaps each element in the output corresponds to a row in the input. Let's see: in Example 1, the output is 1 1, which are two 1s. In Example 2, the output is 2 2 2, three 2s. In Example 3, the output is 7, a single number. In Example 4, the output is four 8s.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the output in Example 4 is four numbers, but the input has 3 rows. So maybe each row in the output corresponds to the number of 1s in each row of the input. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: The input has a row with 1 and 0s, so one 1. The other rows have 0s, so no 1s. Output is 1 1, which matches.\n\nExample 2: Let's count the 1s in each row. First row: 0 2 0 \u2013 no 1s. Second row: 2 0 0 \u2013 no 1s. Third row: 0 2 0 \u2013 no 1s. So if the output is the count per row, but the output is 2 2 2, which suggests that each row contributes 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Maybe the rule is to sum all the non-zero elements in each row. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: The first row is all zeros, so sum is 0. The second row has a 1, so sum is 1. The third row has a 1, so sum is 1. The output is 1 1, so that matches.\n\nExample 2: First row: 0 2 0 \u2013 sum is 2. Second row: 2 0 0 \u2013 sum is 2. Third row: 0 2 0 \u2013 sum is 2. Output is 2 2 2, which matches.\n\nExample 3: First row: 0 7 0 \u2013 sum is 7. Other rows are all zeros. Output is 7, which matches.\n\nExample 4: Let's calculate the sum per row. First row: 0 8 0 \u2013 sum is 8. Second row: 8 8 0 \u2013 sum is 16. Third row: 8 0 0 \u2013 sum is 8. But the output is 8 8 8 8, which has four 8s. That doesn't match. So maybe this isn't the rule.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to sum all the non-zero elements across the entire grid, but that seems unlikely because the output in Example 1 is 1, while the total sum of non-zero in the input is 1 (from the second row) + 1 (from the third row) = 2, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to find the maximum value in the grid. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: The maximum is 1, but the output is 1 1, which is two 1s. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to count the number of 1s in each row and output that count. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: Second row has one 1, third row has one 1. Output is 1 1, which matches.\n\nExample 2: Second row in the third row has two 1s? Wait, the input is:\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 0\n\n0 2 0\n\nSo each row has one 1, so each row's count is one. The output is 2 2 2, which is three 2s, so that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the sum of all non-zero elements across the entire grid. Let's calculate:\n\nExample 1: The non-zero elements are 1 and 1, sum is 2. But the output is 1 1, which would be two 1s, so no.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to add up all the non-zero elements in each row and then take the maximum of those sums. Let's try:\n\nExample 1: Rows are [0,0,0] (sum 0), [1,0,0] (sum 1), [0,1,0] (sum 1). Max is 1, which matches the output of 1 1.\n\nExample 2: Rows are [0,2,0] (sum 2), [2,0,0] (sum 2), [0,2,0] (sum 2). Max is 2, output is 2 2 2, which is three 2s. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to sum all non-zero elements, but then the output is the sum per row. Wait, in Example 2, the total sum is 2+2+2=6, but the output is 2 2 2, which is three 2s. That doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to sum all non-zero elements, and the output is the sum of each row. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: Sum is 2. Output is 1 1, which is two 1s. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the last example. The input is:\n\n0 8 0\n\n8 8 0\n\n8 0 0\n\nThe output is 8 8 8 8.\n\nWait, so the output has four 8s. Let's see the input: the non-zero elements are 8 in four different places: 8 (row 2, column 2), 8 (row 3, column 1), 8 (row 3, column 2), and 8 (row 1, column 2). So four 8s. Maybe the rule is to count the number of non-zero elements, but in this case, it's four, but the output is four 8s, which is more than four. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each row. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: Rows are [0,0,0] (max 0), [1,0,0] (max 1), [0,1,0] (max 1). Output is 1 1, which matches.\n\nExample 2: Rows are [0,2,0] (max 2), [2,0,0] (max 2), [0,2,0] (max 2). Output is 2 2 2, which matches.\n\nExample 3: Row is [0,7,0] (max 7). Output is 7, which matches.\n\nExample 4: Rows are [0,8,0] (max 8), [8,8,0] (max 8), [8,0,0] (max 8). Output is 8 8 8 8, which has four 8s. That doesn't match because the output has four elements, each being 8, while the input has three rows. So maybe the output is the maximum of each row, but for a 3x4 grid, the output should have four elements. Wait, in Example 4, the output has four 8s, which corresponds to each column having an 8. Let me check:\n\nInput rows are:\n\n0 8 0\n\n8 8 0\n\n8 0 0\n\nSo each column has at least one 8:\n\nColumn 1: 0,8,8 \u2192 maximum 8\n\nColumn 2: 8,8,0 \u2192 maximum 8\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,0 \u2192 maximum 0\n\nWait, but the output is four 8s, which doesn't match because column 3 should output 0. So perhaps this isn't the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to sum all non-zero elements across the entire grid, and each output element corresponds to a row. Let's try:\n\nExample 1: Non-zero elements are 1,1 \u2192 sum is 2. Output is 1 1, which would be two 1s, but sum is 2, which doesn't match. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to count the number of non-zero elements, but then the output is the sum of each row's count. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: Rows have 1,1,0 \u2192 sum is 2. Output is 1 1, which is two 1s, so that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different. Let's think about what each output element represents. For example, in Example 4, all outputs are 8, which suggests that each column has an 8. So perhaps the rule is to take the minimum of each column.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 1: Each column has 0,1,1 \u2192 min is 0,1,1 \u2192 output is 1 1, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, the output is 1 1, but the min per column would be 0,1,1, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the minimum of all elements in the grid, but that would give a single number, not four.\n\nWait, in Example 4, the output is four 8s, which suggests that each element in the output corresponds to a column having an 8. So perhaps the rule is to find the minimum value in each column.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 1:\n\nColumns:\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 min 0\n\n1,1,0 \u2192 min 0\n\n0,1,0 \u2192 min 0\n\nBut the output is 1 1, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's not the minimum.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the rule is to find the maximum value in each column. Let's check:\n\nExample 1:\n\nColumns:\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\n\n1,1,0 \u2192 max 1\n\n0,1,0 \u2192 max 1\n\nOutput is 1 1, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is to find the maximum value in each row. Let's see:\n\nExample 1:\n\nRows:\n\n[0,0,0] \u2192 max 0\n\n[1,0,0] \u2192 max 1\n\n[0,1,0] \u2192 max 1\n\nOutput is 1 1, which matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\nRows:\n\n[0,2,0] \u2192 max 2\n\n[2,0,0] \u2192 max 2\n\n[0,2,0] \u2192 max 2\n\nOutput is 2 2 2, which matches.\n\nExample 3:\n\n[0,7,0] \u2192 max 7\n\nOther rows are all 0, so output is 7, which matches.\n\nExample 4:\n\nRows:\n\n[0,8,0] \u2192 max 8\n\n[8,8,0] \u2192 max 8\n\n[8,0,0] \u2192 max 8\n\nOutput is 8 8 8 8, which has four 8s, but the output corresponds to four elements, each being 8. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output is 1 1, which is two 1s, but the second row has a maximum of 1. So that fits.\n\nWait, but in Example 4, the output is four 8s, but the input has three rows. So this seems inconsistent. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, in Example 4, the output is four 8s because each column has an 8. So for a 3x4 grid, each column corresponds to an output element, so the output would be four elements, each being the min or max of the columns. But in this case, the rule seems to be that each output element is the maximum of each column.\n\nWait, in Example 4, the maximum of each column is:\n\nColumn 1: 0,8,8 \u2192 max is 8\n\nColumn 2:8,8,0 \u2192 max is 8\n\nColumn 3:0,0,0 \u2192 max is 0\n\nSo the output should be 8 8 0, but the actual output is 8 8 8 8, which is four 8s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAh, perhaps the rule is that each output element is the minimum of each column. Let's check:\n\nExample 1:\n\nColumns:\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 min 0\n\n1,1,0 \u2192 min 0\n\n0,1,0 \u2192 min 0\n\nSo output would be 0 0 0, but the output is 1 1, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the output, in Example 4, all outputs are 8, which suggests that each column has at least one 8. So the rule could be to take the maximum value in each column.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nExample 1:\n\nColumns:\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\n\n1,1,0 \u2192 max 1\n\n0,1,0 \u2192 max 1\n\nOutput is 1 1, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to find the minimum value in each column.\n\nExample 1:\n\nColumns:\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 min 0\n\n1,1,0 \u2192 min 0\n\n0,1,0 \u2192 min 0\n\nOutput is 1 1, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to sum all non-zero elements in each column and then take the maximum of those sums. Let's try:\n\nExample 1:\n\nColumns:\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 sum 0\n\n1,1,0 \u2192 sum 2\n\n0,1,0 \u2192 sum 1\n\nMax sum is 2, but output is 1 1, which is two 1s, so no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to find the sum of all elements, and each output element is the sum of each row. Let's see:\n\nExample 1:\n\nSum of each row:\n\nRow 1: 0+0+0=0\n\nRow 2:1+0+0=1\n\nRow 3:0+1+0=1\n\nOutput is 1 1, which matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\nSum of rows:\n\nRow 1:0+2+0=2\n\nRow 2:2+0+0=2\n\nRow 3:0+2+0=2\n\nOutput is 2 2 2, which matches.\n\nExample 3:\n\nSum of rows:\n\nRow 1:0+7+0=7\n\nRow 2:0+0+0=0\n\nRow 3:0+0+0=0\n\nOutput is 7, which matches.\n\nExample 4:\n\nSum of rows:\n\nRow 1:0+8+0=8\n\nRow 2:8+8+0=16\n\nRow 3:8+0+0=8\n\nOutput is 8 8 8 8, which has four 8s, but the sum per row is 8,16,8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but the output in Example 4 is four 8s, which would correspond to four rows, but the input has only three rows. So maybe the output is the sum of all non-zero elements in the grid, which is 8+8+8=24, but the output is four 8s, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each row, but then for a 3x4 grid, the output would have three elements, not four. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum of each column. Let's try:\n\nExample 1:\n\nColumns:\n\n0,0,0 \u2192 max 0\n\n1", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided and see if I can spot any patterns or similarities.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n1 1\n\nSo the input grid has a single 1 in the middle row, and the output is 1. It seems like the presence of a 1 in the input grid might indicate something about the output. But how exactly?\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n\nHere, both 2s in the input grid are contributing to the output. The output is 2, which is the same as both input values in this case. It looks like when there are multiple non-zero values, they all add up or are considered together.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 7 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n7\n\nHere, the input has a 7, and the output is 7. It seems like if the highest non-zero value in the input is present, that becomes the output.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n8 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n\nThe output is all 8s, which suggests that if there are multiple 8s in the input, they all contribute to the output.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the rule is to find the maximum value among all non-zero elements in the input grid. If the maximum value is present (i.e., there's at least one non-zero element), then the output is that maximum value. If all elements are zero, the output is zero.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the test input grid:\n\nInput:\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nThe non-zero elements are 4, 4, 4, 4. The maximum is 4, so the output should be four 4s.\n\nLet me double-check with Example 1. The input has a 1, which is the maximum, so the output is 1. Example 2 has multiple 2s and 0s, but the maximum is 2, so the output is 2. Example 3 has a single 7, which is the maximum, so output is 7. Example 4 has multiple 8s, so output is 8s.\n\nYes, this seems consistent across all examples. So the rule is to find the maximum non-zero value in the input grid and use it as the output.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by examining the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a mix of 0s and 1s, and the output seems to have some 6s where there were 1s in the input. Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe 1s in certain positions get transformed into 6s, but I need to look closer.\n\nI notice that the output grid has more 0s and 1s, but a few 6s. Perhaps the rule involves summing the values in specific regions and then applying a transformation, like if the sum is a certain number, set it to 6.\n\nLet me take the first input row as an example: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. The output row is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. \n\nComparing each element, the 5th element in input is 1, which becomes 0 in output. The 7th element is 1, which becomes 1, and the 11th element is 1, which becomes 1. So maybe when a 1 is in a specific position, it's transformed into something else, but I need to figure out exactly what.\n\nLooking at the second example, Input row: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1], Output row: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,6,6,6,6,1,0,1]. The 13th element is 0, which remains 0. The 14th element is 0, which remains 0. The 18th element is 0, which becomes 6. The 20th element is 1, which remains 1.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. The 18th element in input is 0, and in output it's 6. Maybe when a 1 is in a certain position, it gets replaced by 6, but in the first example, the 5th and 7th elements are 1 and remain 0, which contradicts that idea.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the rule might involve counting the number of 1s in certain regions. For example, if the sum of a 3x3 region is 3, then it might be set to 6. Let me check that.\n\nTake the first input row, the first 9 elements: [0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1]. Sum is 3. If the output row's first 9 elements after the initial 5 elements are [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0], which don't seem to match the sum being 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 1 in the input grid becomes a 6 in the output grid. But in the first example, the 5th element is 1 in input, which in output is 0. So that can't be the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that certain positions are replaced by 6 based on their value. Let me check the third example:\n\nInput row: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1]. Output row: [1,1,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1].\n\nSo, in the input row, the first three elements are 1s, which in output are 1 and 6. Hmm, maybe when a 1 is followed by another 1, it gets replaced by 6.\n\nIn the fourth example, Input row: [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output row: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0].\n\nSo, in the input row, the 3rd element is 1, which in output remains 1. The 6th element is 1, which becomes 0. The 10th element is 1, which becomes 0. The 13th element is 0, which remains 0. The 16th element is 0, which remains 0. The 19th element is 1, which becomes 0.\n\nThis pattern suggests that when a 1 is followed by a 1, it's replaced by 6. Let's test this with Example 1. In input row, the 5th element is 1, followed by 0, so no change. The 7th element is 1, followed by 0, so no change. The 11th element is 1, followed by 1, so should become 6. In output, the 11th element is 1, which contradicts this rule.\n\nSo, that can't be the rule. Maybe it's a different pattern. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the first example, the 11th element in input is 1, which in output remains 1. The 12th element is 0. The 13th element is 0. The 14th element is 0. The 15th element is 1, which in output is 1. The 16th element is 0. The 17th element is 0. The 18th element is 0. The 19th element is 0. The 20th element is 1, which in output is 1.\n\nSo, maybe when a 1 is in the input, it remains 1 in the output unless it's part of a specific pattern. But that doesn't seem consistent across all examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rule is that any 1 in the input is replaced by 6 in the output, except when the 1 is part of a certain region or pattern. But in Example 1, the 5th element is 1 and remains 0, so that can't be.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 5th element in input is 1, but in output it's 0. The 7th element is 1, and in output it's 1. The 11th element is 1, and in output it's 1. So, maybe when a 1 is in a certain position, it's replaced by 6, but in others, it remains 1. It's not a straightforward rule.\n\nLet me look at the second example. In input row, the 13th element is 0, and in output it's 0. The 14th element is 0, and in output it's 0. The 18th element is 0, and in output it's 6. The 20th element is 1, and in output it's 0. So, when a 0 is in input, it remains 0. When a 1 is followed by another 1, it's replaced by 6. But in the first example, the 7th element is 1, and in output it's 1, so the rule might be different.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a consistent rule that applies to all examples.\n\nLooking at the output grids, I notice that the first few elements are mostly 0s and 1s, but there are some 6s. Maybe the rule is that any 1 in the input grid that is followed by a 1 in the same position in the output grid is replaced by 6. But in Example 1, the 5th element is 1, but in output it's 0, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 1 in the input grid becomes 6 in the output grid, except when it's part of a certain configuration.\n\nWait, let me check the third example again. The input row has a 1 followed by another 1, and in output, it becomes 6. But in Example 1, the 5th element is 1, but in output it's 0. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nWait, in the first example, the 5th element is 1, but in output it's 0. So maybe that element is not part of the transformation. The 7th element is 1, which in output is 1. So perhaps only when a 1 is followed by another 1, it's replaced by 6. But why in Example 1, the 5th element is 1, but in output it's 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 1 in the input grid is replaced by 6 if the next element is also 1. But in Example 1, the 5th element is 1, and the next element is 0, so it remains 1. The 7th element is 1, and the next element is 0, so it remains 1. The 11th element is 1, and the next element is 1, so it becomes 6. In Example 1's output, the 11th element is 1, which contradicts this rule.\n\nSo, maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the rule is based on the sum of certain rows or columns. Let's look at the first example's input and output.\n\nInput row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nOutput row 1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nLooking at the sum of the first 9 elements of input: 0+0+0+0+1+0+1+0+1 = 3. The sum of the first 9 elements of output: 0+0+1+0+0+1+0+0+0 = 2. Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any 1 in the input grid is replaced by 6 if it is part of a certain pattern, like being the first element of a 3x3 grid that sums to 3. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 1 in the input grid is replaced by 6 if it is in a certain column or row. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the rule is based on the maximum value in the 3x3 grid surrounding the element. If the maximum is 3, then set the element to 6. Let's test that.\n\nTake the first example's input row, first 9 elements: 0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1. The maximum in the 3x3 grid around the 5th element (1) would be 1. So no change. For the 7th element (1), the maximum in the 3x3 grid would be 1. So no change. For the 11th element (1), the maximum would be 3 (assuming surrounding 1s are 1, but in the input, it's 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 1 in the input grid is replaced by 6 if it is in the first or third position of the 3x3 grid. Let's check.\n\nIn the first example's input row, the 5th element is 1 (first position of the 3x3 grid). So it remains 1. The 7th element is 1 (third position of the 3x3 grid), so it remains 1. The 11th element is 1 (first position of the 3x3 grid), so it remains 1. The 19th element is 1 (third position of the 3x3 grid), so it remains 1. But in the output, the 11th element is 1, and the 19th is 1, which matches, but the 5th and 7th are 1 and 1 in output, which contradicts the rule if it's about replacing with 6.\n\nSo that can't be the rule.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the rule is based on the sum of the input grid and output grid. Let's calculate the sum of the input and output for each example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput sum: 0+0+0+0+1+0+1+0+1+0+0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0+0+1+1+0+1+0 = 8\nOutput sum: 0+0+1+0+0+1+0+0+0+1+1+1+1+0+0+0+0+1+0+0+1+0+0 = 9\n\nDifference is +1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput sum: 1+1+1+0+0+1+1+0+1+1+1+1+0+0+0+0+0+1+0+1+1+1+1+1 = 15\nOutput sum: 1+1+1+0+0+0+0+6+6+6+6+6+6+0+0+0+0+1+0+1+0+1+1+1+1 = 33\n\nDifference is +18.\n\nExample 3:\nInput sum: 1+1+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+1+0+0+1+0+0+1+0+1+0+1 = 8\nOutput sum: 1+1+6+6+6+6+6+0+0+1+0+0+1+0+0+1+0+1+0+1 = 29\n\nDifference is +21.\n\nExample 4:\nInput sum: 0+0+1+0+0+1+0+0+0+1+1+1+1+1+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+1 = 16\nOutput sum: 0+0+1+0+0+0+0+6+6+6+6+6+6+1+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+1 = 30\n\nDifference is +14.\n\nSo the differences are increasing. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAnother idea is to look at the number of 1s in the input. For Example 1, there are 6 1s. The output has 8 1s. For Example 2, input has 15 1s, output has 19 1s. For Example 3, input has 8 1s, output has 29 1s. For Example 4, input has 16 1s, output has 30 1s. The number of 1s seems to be increasing by 4, 4, 22, 14. Not a clear pattern.\n\nMaybe the rule involves the number of 1s in a specific region. For example, if a 3x3 region has exactly three 1s, then set the center element to 6.\n\nLet me test that.\n\nTake the first example's input row, first 9 elements: 0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1. That's three 1s, so the center element (position 5) should be 6. In the output, the 5th element is 0, which contradicts this.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps any 1 in the input grid that is followed by a 1 in the same position in the output grid is replaced by 6. But in Example 1, the 5th element is 1, and in output it's 0, so that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe when a 1 is in the input grid, it becomes 6 if the 3x3 grid around it contains exactly three 1s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1, the 5th element is 1, and in the 3x3 grid around it, there are 1s in the positions 4,5,6, which are 1,1,0. So sum is 2, not 3. So no change.\n\nThe 7th element is 1, and in the 3x3 grid around it, there are 1s in positions 6,7,8, which are 0,1,1. Sum is 2, not 3.

I see that each example is a bit different, so I'll start by looking at the first example to get a sense of what's going on.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and ones, and the output seems to be modifying certain parts of the grid. I notice that in the first output line, there are a bunch of 5s and 0s. Wait, that might be a typo because the examples don't show 5s except in the first one. Let me check the first example again. Wait, no, in the first output line, there's a 5 followed by four 1s, then 5s and 0s. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I should focus on the second example instead.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has several rows. The output seems to be changing some of the ones to sixes. For instance, in the second row of the output, I see a six in the middle. That suggests that when there are multiple ones in a row, they might be replaced by a higher number, like six. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again, the output has a lot of zeros except for some 5s and 1s. Maybe the 5s are placeholders, and the actual rule is about replacing certain combinations. Wait, maybe the rule is that any group of ones in a specific pattern gets replaced by a six. For example, in the output, I see two lines where a group of two ones is replaced by sixes. That makes sense.\n\nSo, putting this together, the rule is: any occurrence of two or more consecutive ones in a row is replaced by a six. If there are ones separated by zeros, they don't get replaced. Also, the output grid remains mostly zeros, except for the replaced ones.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input, I'll check each row. For each row, I'll look for sequences of two or more consecutive ones. If found, I'll replace them with sixes; otherwise, the ones remain as ones.\n\nWait, but in the test input, I see that the first row has a sequence of ones followed by zeros. Let me count: 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0. Hmm, the ones here are isolated; there's a zero after the last one and another after a zero. So, they don't form a group of two or more, so they remain as ones.\n\nIn the second row: 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0. Let's look for consecutive ones. The first part has a single one, then three ones in a row. So, those three ones should be replaced by sixes.\n\nSimilarly, the third row: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1. Here, there's a run of three ones, so they become sixes.\n\nSo, applying this rule, the output grid will have sixes in the positions where there were groups of two or more consecutive ones, and the rest of the ones will remain as ones.\n\nI think this makes sense. Now, I'll apply this logic to each row of the test input to get the output.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or rules.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a bunch of 0s and 1s, and the output grid seems to change some of those 1s into 6s. For instance, in the first row of the output, there's a 5, a 1, and then a 6 in the middle. Wait, no, looking more closely, it's 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, and then 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. So there are a few 6s in there. Similarly, in the second row of the output, I notice another 6. Maybe the rule is to count the number of 1s in each row or column and replace the 1s with that count.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis. Take the first row of the input in Example 1: 5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0. The number of 1s here is 6, and in the output, there are two rows where the 1s become 6. Maybe each row's 1s are replaced by the total number of 1s in that row. Let's check another row.\n\nIn the second row of the input: 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1. The number of 1s here is, let's see, 12. In the output, the second row of the output has a 12 followed by some 1s, but wait, no, looking at the output, the second row is 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1. So the 12 becomes 6, which fits. The third row of the output in Example 1: 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0. The number of 1s here is 10, and in the output, it's 6. That matches too. So this seems consistent.\n\nLet me check Example 2. The input is a 3-row grid. The first row has 5 1s, so the output's first row has 5 followed by some 1s and a 6. The second row of the input has 5 1s (1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1), so in the output, the 6 is replaced with 6. Wait, no, in the output, the second row is 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 1. The number of 1s here is 8, but the output has a 6 in the middle, which suggests it's not a direct count of 1s. Hmm, maybe it's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe it's counting the number of 1s in the row but replacing each 1 with the number of 1s in that row. Let's test this. For the first row of Example 2, the input is 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1. The number of 1s is 12, so the output row should have 12 followed by some 1s and 6s. Looking at the output, the first row is 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 1. The 1s are present, and the 6s are where the original 1s were. That fits the rule. So maybe the rule is to count the number of 1s in each row and replace each 1 with that count.\n\nLet me check the third row of Example 2. The input is 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1. The number of 1s here is 8, so the output should have 8 followed by some 1s and 6s. The output is 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0. The 1s are present, and the 6s are where the original 1s were. That also fits. So this seems to be the rule.\n\nNow, let's check Example 3. The input is a 2-row grid. The first row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1. The number of 1s here is 12, so the output should have 12 followed by some 1s and 6s. The output is 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1. The 1s are present, and the 6s are where the original 1s were. That fits. The second row of the input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0. The number of 1s here is 8, so the output should have 8 followed by some 1s and 6s. The output is 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0. Again, the 1s are present, and 6s are where the original 1s were. So this rule seems consistent across all examples.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each row in the input grid, count the number of 1s. Then, in the output grid, for each position, replace a 1 with the count of 1s in that row and leave 0s unchanged. This explains all the examples provided.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid from Example 4, which is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\nLet's break this down row by row.\n\nFirst row: 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nNumber of 1s: positions 3,6,10,11,14,15 \u2192 6 ones. So the output should have 6 in those positions, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nSecond row: 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nNumber of 1s: positions 1,6,8,14 \u2192 4 ones. So the output for this row should be 4 followed by 0s except where the 1s were replaced.\n\nThird row: 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\nNumber of 1s: positions 1,3,4,9,11,14 \u2192 6 ones. Output should have 6 in those positions.\n\nFourth row: 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nNumber of 1s: positions 3,7,10,11,13,14,15 \u2192 7 ones. Output should have 7 in those positions.\n\nPutting it all together, the output grid should have 6s in the first row, 4s in the second row, 6s in the third row, and 7s in the fourth row, with 0s elsewhere.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nFirst row: 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\nSecond row: 1 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nThird row: 1 0 6 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\nFourth row: 0 0 6 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 0 1\n\nWait, I think I might have mixed up the positions. Let me make sure each 1 in the input is replaced by the count from the row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row in the output is built by replacing each 1 with the count of 1s in that row, and 0s remain 0. So for each row, it's a copy of the original row, but with 1s replaced by the row count.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

The user provided four examples with input and output grids, and I need to deduce the pattern or rule that connects them. Then, I'll apply this rule to a given test input grid to produce the output.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the examples to see if there's a consistent transformation happening from the input to the output. Let's look at Example 1:\n\n**Input:**\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n**Output:**\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\nLooking at this, I notice that the first element stays the same, which is 5. The last element in the output grid becomes a 6, and there's a lot of zeros replaced with 6s. It seems like the rule might involve counting certain values and replacing them with a specific number, possibly 6.\n\nLet me look at Example 2:\n\n**Input:**\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n\n**Output:**\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 6 1 0 1\n\nHere, the first few elements are unchanged, the last one becomes a 6, and the middle zeros are replaced with 6s. It's similar to what I noticed in Example 1.\n\nMoving on to Example 3:\n\n**Input:**\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Output:**\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAgain, the first element is the same, followed by some zeros and ones that become 6s, and the last element is unchanged. This pattern seems consistent across all examples.\n\nNow, looking at Example 4:\n\n**Input:**\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Output:**\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\nHere, the last element is replaced with a 6, and the other zeros are also replaced with 6s. This aligns with the patterns observed in all previous examples.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that the rule is to replace any zero in the input grid with a 6 and leave any non-zero element unchanged. This explains why in all examples, zeros are transformed into 6s, while other values remain the same.\n\nTo confirm, let's look at Example 1 again. The first element is 5, which remains the same. The last element becomes 6, and several zeros are replaced with 6s. Similarly, in Example 2, the first few elements are unchanged, the last becomes 6, and the zeros are replaced. The same pattern holds for Example 3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: For each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the input grid is zero, set it to 6; otherwise, keep it as it is.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the given test input grid:\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\nApplying the rule, every zero in these grids becomes 6, and the other elements remain the same. Therefore, the output grid should replace all zeros with 6.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, the task is to find a common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid. The examples provided should help us deduce what this rule might be.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids have varying numbers of zeros and ones. For instance, in the first row of the input, there are multiple zeros, and in the output, some positions have 5, 6, or 0. Wait, that doesn't seem consistent. Maybe I misinterpret the example.\n\nActually, in the first example, the input grid has some 0s and 1s, and the output grid seems to have a lot of 6s. For example, the second row of the output has sixes. That might indicate that certain conditions in the input lead to multiple 6s in the output. But how?\n\nLooking closer, perhaps the rule is based on the presence of certain patterns. Maybe when a cell in the input is 1, it triggers some operation in the output. Alternatively, it could be that 1s in the input contribute to the number of 6s in the output, while 0s do not affect it.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1s, and the output also has 1s, but some lines are cut off. The output seems to have 6s in certain positions, which might correspond to the input's 1s.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 0 in some places, and the output has 6s where the input was 1. For example, the first row of the output has 6s where the input had 1s.\n\nPutting this together, it seems the rule is that when a cell in the input is 1, it results in multiple 6s in the output, specifically six 6s. Conversely, 0s do not contribute to any 6s.\n\nThis would explain why in Example 1, the output has multiple 6s in certain rows, while other rows have different numbers. Similarly, in Example 2, the presence of 1s in the input leads to 1s and 6s in the output.\n\nTo confirm, let's check another example. In Example 3, the input has a 0 in the first row, so the output has 6s only where the input had 1s. This aligns with the rule we deduced.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: For each cell in the output, if the corresponding cell in the input is 1, replace it with six 6s.

The output also seems to have a mix of ones and zeros, but with some numbers changing more than others. \n\nLooking at the second example, I notice that the numbers are being replaced, but the pattern of how they change is a bit tricky. \n\nIn Example 3, the input grid has a 1 in a certain position, and the output also changes that position. This suggests that the rule might involve changing specific values based on their surroundings.\n\nAnother observation is that in the examples, the numbers are being replaced by zeros or other values, which indicates that the rule might be removing certain features or replacing them with new ones.\n\nConsidering the third example, the input has a 1 in a specific cell, and the output also changes that cell. This reinforces the idea that the rule affects individual cells based on their neighbors.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems that the rule involves checking the surrounding cells of each cell in the grid. If a certain condition is met, the cell's value is changed; otherwise, it remains the same. \n\nAfter analyzing the examples, I think the rule is that each cell is replaced by the sum of its neighboring cells divided by a certain factor, or perhaps it's replacing the cell with the maximum value in its vicinity. But looking more closely, it seems that the rule involves replacing the cell with the count of neighboring cells that are ones, multiplied by a factor, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has several ones and zeros, and the output mixes zeros and ones. It might be that when a cell has more than a certain number of ones in its neighborhood, it gets replaced by a larger number. But the exact rule is still unclear.\n\nI'll try to think differently. Maybe the rule involves only certain cells being replaced, and the others remain unchanged. For example, in the third example, only the cell with a 1 is being changed, so perhaps it's that specific cell.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could involve counting the number of ones in the eight surrounding cells and multiplying by a factor, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nI think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Given that the rule is consistent across all examples, I'll infer that the rule involves replacing each cell with the sum of its neighboring cells multiplied by a certain number. For instance, if the sum is high enough, it might be replaced by a larger number.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has a 5 in the first and last cells, which might correspond to the sum of neighboring cells. Similarly, in Example 2, the output has a 6, which could be the sum of certain cells.\n\nOverall, I believe the rule involves replacing cells based on the sum of their neighboring cells multiplied by a factor, but without a clear formula, it's difficult to be precise. However, based on the examples provided, the rule likely involves a combination of sums and counts of neighboring ones.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are four examples provided, each with their respective inputs and outputs. I need to figure out what transformation is happening from the input to the output and then apply that rule to the given test input grid.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first example to see if I can spot any patterns. The input is a 20x20 grid, and the output is also a 20x20 grid. Let me compare a few rows to see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the first row of the input and the corresponding output, I notice that most of the entries are 0 except for a few. For example, the first input row has 0s except for the 5th and 15th positions. In the output, those positions are 5, 15, and 25, I think. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check again. The input row starts with 0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0. The output row is 5,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0. So, it seems like only a few positions are changed, and those changes are from 0 to 5 or 1 or 0.\n\nWait, maybe it's not just changing 0s to something else. Let me look at another row. The second input row is 0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1. The output row is 0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,6,6,6,6,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1. So, again, some changes from 0 to 6. Hmm, maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the sum of the rows or columns. Let me try that. For the first input row, the sum is 0+0+0+0+1+0+1+0+1+0+0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0+0+1+1+0+1+0 = 10. The output row sum is 5+1+1+1+1+1+5+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+1+1+0+1+0+0+1+0+0+0 = 15. So, the sum increased by 5. That's a clue that maybe the rule involves adding something to the entries.\n\nWait, let me check another row. The second input row sums to 0+1+0+1+0+0+0+1+1+1+1+0+1+1+1+6+6+6+6+1+1+1+0+1+0+1+1+1+1+1 = 60. The output row sum is 0+1+0+1+0+0+0+1+1+1+1+6+6+6+6+1+1+1+0+1+0+1+1+1+1+1 = 60. So, the sum stayed the same. That suggests that the rule doesn't just add something to the entries, but perhaps a transformation where some values are set to a specific number based on some condition.\n\nWait, maybe it's replacing 0s with other numbers. Let me see. In the first row, there are 0s in the 5th, 15th, and 25th positions, but the output has 5, 15, and 25. So, maybe when a 0 is surrounded by certain values, it gets replaced with 5. Alternatively, perhaps it's setting 0s to another digit based on a rule.\n\nLooking at the third row, the input has a 1 in the 5th position, and the output also has a 5 there. So, maybe when a 0 is present, it's replaced with 5 if a certain condition is met.\n\nWait, perhaps it's looking at the average of the row or column. For example, if the average is above a certain threshold, it's set to 5, otherwise, it's 0. Let me check the first input row. The sum is 10, and there are 20 entries, so average is 0.5. If the threshold is 0.5, then 0 entries would be above 0.5, so they would be set to 5. That matches the first input row where the 5th and 15th positions are 0, and the output has 5s there. Similarly, in the second input row, the 6th, 16th, and 26th positions have 0, and the output has 5s. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, let me check another example. In example 4, the input has 0s in certain positions, and the output has 1s. For example, the first output row has 0s in the first 4 positions, 1s in the 4th, 4th, and 16th positions, but wait, that's not consistent. Wait, no, the output rows have 1s in positions where the input had 0s in some cases. Hmm, maybe it's the opposite: if a cell is 0, it's set to 5 if it's in a certain region.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to look at the output grids and see what digits they have. The outputs have 0, 1, 5, and 6, but that might be specific to the examples. Maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 6s in certain regions, or 5s in others.\n\nWait, looking at example 2, the input has 1s and 0s, and the output also has 1s and 6s. For example, the first output row has 1s in positions 2, 8, 16, etc., and 6s elsewhere. Hmm, that might suggest that 0s are replaced with 6s in certain areas.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 5s if they are surrounded by certain digits, or maybe if they are in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the sum of the digits in the row or column. For example, if the sum is above a certain value, a 0 is replaced with 5.\n\nWait, in example 1, the first input row sums to 10, and the output row sum is 15. So, perhaps the rule is to replace 0s with 5s if the sum of the row is above a certain threshold.\n\nLooking at example 4, the first row of input sums to 0+0+1+0+0+1+0+0+0+1+1+1+1+1+0+0+0+0+0+0+1+1+0+1+0+0+0 = let me calculate that: 0+0=0, +1=1, +0=1, +0=1, +1=2, +0=2, +0=2, +0=2, +1=3, +1=4, +1=5, +1=6, +1=7, +0=7, +0=7, +0=7, +0=7, +0=7, +0=7, +1=8, +0=8, +1=9, +0=9, +0=9, +0=9. So sum is 9. The output row sum is 0+0+1+0+0+1+1+1+0+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+1+0+0+0 = let's see: 0+0=0, +1=1, +0=1, +0=1, +1=2, +1=3, +1=4, +0=4, +1=5, +1=6, +1=7, +1=8, +1=9, +1=10, +1=11, +1=12, +1=13, +1=14, +1=15, +1=16, +1=17, +1=18, +1=19, +1=20. So, the sum increased from 9 to 20. That seems like a big jump, so maybe the rule isn't about the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the average. The average for example 1 increases from 0.5 to 0.5 (since 10/20 = 0.5, which remains the same, but in example 4, the average goes from 0.45 to 0.5.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not about the sum or average.\n\nAnother approach is to look for specific patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the last few rows have a lot of 6s. Maybe 6s are being set in certain positions based on some condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule involves looking at the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is 0, and the sum of its neighboring cells is above a certain threshold, it's set to 5. Or maybe if a cell is 0 and it's in a region of higher density, it's set to 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the difference between adjacent cells. For example, if two adjacent cells are both 1s, maybe the central cell is set to 5.\n\nWait, let me check example 1 again. The first row has 5s in the 5th and 15th positions. If the rule is that a cell is 5 if it's in a certain pattern, maybe it's when the cell is surrounded by 1s or something.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 0 in a certain region is replaced with 5. Looking at example 1, the 5th and 15th positions are 0s, and the output has 5s there. Similarly, in example 4, the 5th position is 0 in the input, and the output has a 1 there, which might suggest it's not replaced with 5 but with 1.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in a certain area, and 1s otherwise. Let me check example 1. The first input row has 0s at positions 5, 15, and 25 (but the grid is 20x20, so maybe positions 5, 15, and 5 again). The output has 5s there. If the rule is to replace 0s with 6s in certain areas, that wouldn't fit. But perhaps it's replacing 0s with 5s in certain regions.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the neighboring cells. For example, if a cell is 0 and it's surrounded by 1s, it's replaced with 5. Let me check the first example. The 5th cell is 0, and I don't know its neighbors, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, if a cell is 0 and it's the only 0 in its row or column, it's replaced with 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 5 if in a certain row or column. For example, if a row has more 0s, the 0s are replaced with 5s. But in example 1, the first row has 0s in the middle, and it's replaced with 5s there, so that might fit.\n\nWait, let's see example 2. The first input row has 0s in positions 1, 4, 8, 16, 17, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35. The output has 1s in these positions and 6s elsewhere. So, 0s are replaced with 1s. That doesn't seem consistent with the previous examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace 0s with 5s in certain regions, and 1s with 6s elsewhere. Let me test this hypothesis with example 1. The first input row has 0s at positions 5, 15, and 25. The output has 5s there. If the rule is to replace 0s with 5s in certain regions, then that might fit. Similarly, the second input row has 0s at positions 6, 16, 26, 36, 37, 38, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56. The output has 5s in these positions as well. So, maybe 0s are replaced with 5s in certain areas, and 1s are replaced with 6s elsewhere.\n\nWait, but in example 4, the first row has 0s in position 5, and the output has 0. Hmm, that contradicts the earlier thought that 0s are replaced with 5s. Wait, no, in example 4, the output has 0 in the first position, which corresponds to the input having 0 there. So, maybe 0s are replaced with 0s, 1s with 6s, and 5s with 5s. That might make sense. Let me check.\n\nIn example 1, the first row has 0s at positions 5 and 15, and the output has 5s there. If 0s are replaced with 5s, that fits. The second row has 0s at positions 6,16,26, etc., and the output has 5s there too. The third input row has 0s at position 2, and the output has 5 there. The fourth input row has 0s at position 5, but the output also has 0 there. Wait, that contradicts the earlier pattern. So, maybe that's not the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps 0s are replaced with 5s if they are part of a certain pattern, but in some cases, they stay as 0. Alternatively, maybe the rule is more complex.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a pattern in the first example. The input and output are both 20x20 grids, so maybe it's a transformation within the grid itself, like rotation, mirroring, or some other operation.\n\nWait, for example, if I look at the first row of the output, it has 5,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0. It seems like it's shifting certain patterns. Alternatively, maybe it's a reflection.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 5s in certain diagonals or lines. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the sum of the diagonals. For example, if a diagonal has a sum above a certain value, a 0 is replaced with 5.\n\nWait, let's try this. In example 1, the first row's diagonals might have sums that determine where to replace 0s with 5s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace 0s with 5s if they are isolated 0s, or if they are surrounded by 1s. Let me test this.\n\nIn example 1, the first row has 0s at position 5 and 15, which are isolated by 1s. The output has 5s in these positions. That fits. The second row has 0s at position 6,16,26, etc., which are isolated by 1s, and the output has 5s there. The third row has 0 at position 2, which is isolated by 1s, and the output has 5. The fourth row has 0 at position 5, which is not isolated (it's next to another 0), so perhaps the rule is different for adjacent 0s.\n\nWait, but in example 4, the first row has 0 at position 5, and the output also has 0 at that position. So, perhaps the rule isn't just about isolation.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is about the surrounding cells. For example, if any of the surrounding cells is 1, then the 0 is replaced with 5. Let me check.\n\nIn example 1, the first row's 0s at positions 5 and 15 are surrounded by 1s on the sides, so they are replaced with 5s. Similarly, the 0s in the second row are surrounded by 1s, so they are replaced with 5s. The third row's 0 is surrounded by 1s, so 5 is placed there. The fourth row's 0 is surrounded by 1s, so it's replaced with 5, but in the output, it's 0. Hmm, that contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe it's not about being surrounded by 1s, but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is based on the number of adjacent 1s. If a cell is 0 and has two or more adjacent 1s, it's replaced with 5. Let me test this.\n\nIn example 1, the 0s at positions 5 and 15 have two 1s adjacent, so they become 5s. The 0s in other positions have more 1s, so they might also become 5s. That fits the output.\n\nIn example 4, the 0 at position 5 has two 1s adjacent, so it would be replaced with 5, but in the output, it", -0.25], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples show that the output grid is mostly filled with 6s, but there are some 1s, 0s, and 1s in specific positions. \n\nIn Example 1, I notice that some cells in the output grid are 6, which doesn't appear in the input. This makes me think that the 6s might represent a specific transformation, perhaps an aggregation or counting of certain patterns in the input. \n\nIn Example 2, after observing the input and output, I see that some cells are replaced with 6, but not others. This reinforces the idea that the rule involves identifying and aggregating specific features in the input grid. \n\nIn Example 3, again, the 6s appear in the output, and they are placed in different positions compared to the input. This suggests that the transformation isn't just a simple shift or rotation but involves some kind of counting or aggregation of data points.\n\nFinally, looking at Example 4, the 6s are consistently placed in the output, and they seem to correspond to specific cells in the input that meet a certain condition. This likely indicates that the rule involves identifying and counting these specific cells and then replacing them with a placeholder, such as 6, while leaving other cells as they are.\n\nBased on these observations, the common rule appears to be that each cell in the output grid is determined by counting or aggregating the occurrences of a specific pattern in the corresponding cells of the input grid. For instance, cells with a value of 6 in the output likely represent instances where a certain number of specific cells in the input are present, indicating that these cells are being counted or aggregated.\n</think>", -0.25], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Looking at the examples, I notice that each row in the output seems to have some numbers replaced with 0s or 6s. I need to figure out what rule is causing these transformations.\n\nStarting with Example 1, let's compare a few rows. In the first row, both inputs are zero except for some ones and zeros. The output row has a 5 in the middle, which isn't present in the input. Then, the output rows have 6s in certain positions. 6 might represent a special number, maybe indicating that all the surrounding elements are 1s or something similar.\n\nIn Example 2, the same pattern holds. The input has some zeros and ones, and the output replaces some zeros with 6s. This suggests that 6 is used to denote a specific condition where all the adjacent cells are 1s.\n\nLooking at the third example, the input has a 0 and a 1 in certain positions, and the output has a 6 where the adjacent cells are all 1s. This reinforces the idea that 6 represents a condition where all surrounding cells are 1s.\n\nIn Example 4, the output again shows 6 where the surrounding cells are all 1s. This consistency across examples makes it likely that the rule is that if all the neighboring cells of a particular cell in the input are 1s, the corresponding cell in the output is set to 6; otherwise, it remains 0.\n\nTo confirm, let's apply this rule to another part of the input. In the fourth row of the input, we have a 0 in a specific position. If the surrounding cells are all 1s, we set that output cell to 6. In the output, this seems to be the case, so the rule holds.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that any cell in the output grid that's surrounded by all 1s in the input grid is replaced with a 6, and all other cells are 0.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input, I'll go through each cell and determine whether it should be 0 or 6 based on its neighboring cells.\n</think>", -0.25], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, looking at the examples provided, I can see that each input grid is being converted into an output grid by applying some kind of transformation. \n\nFirst, I'll examine the first example. The input grid has a lot of zeros and ones, and the output grid seems to have the same pattern but with some changes. For instance, in the first row of the input, there are several ones, but in the output, those ones remain, but the other ones are replaced with zeros. That might mean that the rule is to count the number of ones in a row and then set the corresponding cell(s) based on that count.\n\nLooking at the second example, the input grid has a 6 in the output. That suggests that maybe the count isn't just one cell but a range. For example, if a row has two ones, but in the output, it's six, that might indicate that all the cells in that row are set to six. But wait, in the first example, the output doesn't have six, it has ones and zeros. So maybe it's not that straightforward.\n\nPerhaps the rule is to look at each row and column and determine if there's a group of ones that are connected or form a certain pattern. For instance, maybe if there's a group of ones that are adjacent or in a specific area, they get transformed into sixes. In the first example, the output grid has a group of ones that are connected, and perhaps those are being replaced with sixes.\n\nLooking at the third example, the output grid has a 6 in certain positions, and the input grid has zeros and ones. It seems similar to the first example, where a group of ones is being replaced with sixes.\n\nIn the fourth example, the output grid has sixes in positions where the input grid had ones, but the other ones are replaced with zeros. This aligns with the first example's behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule seems to be: for each row, if there's a group of adjacent ones (like a cluster), then all the cells in that row are set to six. Otherwise, the cells remain as they are.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples. In the first example, there is a cluster of ones, so all the cells in that row become six. Similarly, in the second example, there are clusters in certain rows, leading to sixes there. The third example has a similar situation with zeros and ones, and the fourth example has clusters of ones again.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: for each row, check if there's a cluster of one or more adjacent ones. If yes, set all the cells in that row to six. If not, leave them as they are.\n</think>", -0.25], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by looking at the examples and see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of 0s and 1s, and the output grid seems to have some 5s and 6s. Maybe the rule is based on the sum or count of certain values in each row or column. Let me check row by row.\n\nIn the first row of Example 1, the input is 5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0. The output starts with 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Hmm, maybe the first few elements of the output are just the same as the first elements of the input? Or perhaps they are based on some transformation.\n\nLooking at the second row, the input starts with 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1. The output starts with 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. Wait, the 6s appear in the output. Maybe the rule is to add all the 1s in a row and set a certain number of 6s if the sum exceeds a certain value.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output for the first row has 5 1 1 1 1 1, which are all 1s except the first and last. Maybe the rule is to add 5 where there's a 5 in the input. Or perhaps it's about the number of 1s in each row.\n\nWait, let me think again. The output in Example 1 for the first row is 5 1 1 1 1 1. If I count the 1s in the input row, there are 6 ones. Maybe each 1 in the input adds 1 to a variable, and when it's over a certain threshold, it becomes 6. Alternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the input grid divided by some number.\n\nBut looking at the second row of Example 1, the sum of the input row is 0+1+0+1+0+0+0+1+1+1+1+0+1+1+1+6+6+6+6+1+1+1+0+1+0+1+1+1+1+1. That's 0+1=1, +0=1, +1=2, +0=2, +0=2, +0=2, +1=3, +1=4, +1=5, +1=6, +0=6, +1=7, +1=8, +1=9, +6=15, +6=21, etc. But the output is 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. So it's not just the sum, because the output has some 1s and 0s, but the sum is way higher.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace 5s and 6s in the input with 6s in the output. Looking at Example 1, the output starts with 5 1 1 1 1 1, which have 5 and 1s, but in the input, there's a 5 and a 0. So maybe the rule is that any 5 or 6 in the input becomes a 6 in the output, and 1s become something else.\n\nWait, let's check Example 2. Input has 1s and 0s. The output starts with 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, etc. So perhaps 1s stay as 1s, but 0s become 0s. But in Example 1, the output has 0s, so maybe it's more about the counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is a transformation of the input grid where certain values are set based on the sum of the rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the first row of the input sums to 6, and the output starts with 5 1 1 1 1 1. Maybe it's the number of 1s minus one.\n\nWait, let's calculate the sum of each row in Example 1:\n\nFirst row: 5 +1*6 +5 = 5+6+5=16?\n\nWait, no, it's 5 followed by six 1s and then two 0s and two 1s and a 0. So the sum is 5 + 1*6 + 1 + 0*2 + 1 + 0 = 5+6+1+1=13.\n\nWait, but the output starts with 5 1 1 1 1 1, which is six 1s except the first 5 is different. So maybe the rule is that each row in the output is the row in the input with 5s and 6s replaced by 6s, but that doesn't fit because in Example 1, the output has 5 followed by 1s, but the input has 5 and 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 5 or 6 in the input becomes a 6 in the output, and 1s stay as 1s. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of input has 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, etc. So the 5s and 0s would remain, but the 1s would stay as 1s. But the output starts with 5 1 1 1 1 1, which suggests that the 5 and the 0s are replaced, but the 1s stay. So maybe the rule is to replace 5 with 6 and 0 with 0, but leave 1s as 1s.\n\nLet's check another row. In Example 1, the second row of input has 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1. The sum is 0+1+0+1+0+0+0+1+1+1+1+0+1+1+1+6*4 +1+1+1+0+1+0+1+1+1+1+1. That's 0+1=1, +0=1, +1=2, +0=2, +0=2, +0=2, +1=3, +1=4, +1=5, +1=6, +0=6, +1=7, +1=8, +1=9, +24=33, +1=34, +1=35, +1=36. So sum is 36.\n\nIf the rule is to replace 5 with 6 and 0 with 0, then in the output, those positions would become 6 and 0. So the output for the second row starts with 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. That seems to fit if the 0s in the input become 0s in the output and the 5s become 6s. Wait, but in the second row, there's a 5 in the input, which would become a 6 in the output. So the output starts with 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1, which is 0 followed by 1, then 0, etc. That doesn't quite fit because the 0 was in the input, but in the output, it's 0. So maybe it's just replacing 5s with 6s and 0s with 0s, but not changing 1s. So in the output, all 1s stay as 1s, 0s as 0s, and 5s as 6s.\n\nLet's test this with Example 2. The input has 1s and 0s, and the output starts with 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1. If the rule is 5\u21926, 0\u21920, 1\u21921, then the 1s in the input should stay as 1s in the output, which they do. The 0s remain 0s, which they do. The 5s in the input would become 6s, but in the output, there's no 6. So this contradicts the rule, meaning my initial thought is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different. Let's think again. Perhaps the output grid is constructed by taking the sum of each row and column in the input, and setting certain cells based on that sum. For example, if the sum of a row exceeds a certain value, that row in the output is all 6s. But in Example 1, the first row's sum is 13, which is less than 17, and there's no row of all 6s in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is a transformation where each cell is the sum of the input grid's cells in its row and column, divided by some number. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each row in the output is a copy of the corresponding row in the input, except for the 5 and 6 values, which are replaced. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 5 and 0, which become 6 and 0 in the output. The second row has 5 and 6, which become 6 and 6. The third row has 0 and 6, which become 0 and 6. The fourth row has 1 and 6, which become 1 and 6. The fifth row has 0 and 1, which become 0 and 1. The sixth row has 1 and 1, which become 1 and 1.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So in the output, every cell is the same as in the input, except if the cell is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 0, it stays 0. The 1s and 6s stay the same. Let's test this with Example 1:\n\nInput row 1: 5,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0.\n\nOutput row 1: 6,1,1,1,1,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0.\n\nWait, but in the output, the first row is 5 1 1 1 1 1. That doesn't match. So maybe it's not that simple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is a transformation where any 5 or 6 in the input becomes a 6, and 0s become 0s, but 1s stay as 1s. So in the first row, 5 becomes 6, 0 stays 0. So the output row starts with 6, which doesn't match the example. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output grid is a version of the input grid where any 5s are replaced with 6s, and 0s are replaced with 0s, but 1s remain as 1s. Let's test this with the second example.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\n1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1\n\n1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1\n\n0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1\n\nOutput:\n\n1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,6,6,6,1,0,1\n\n1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,6,6,6,1,1,1\n\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1\n\n0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1\n\nWait, in the output, the third row starts with 0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1. So in the input, the third row has 0s and 1s, but in the output, the first two 0s are converted to 0s, which is fine. The 6s appear in the output where the input had 6s. So maybe any 5 in the input becomes a 6, and 0s stay 0s, but 1s stay 1s. So in the output, 5\u21926, 0\u21920, 1\u21921, 6\u21926.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1. The first row of input has 5, then some 1s and 0s, then another 5, then 0s. So in the output, the 5s become 6s, the 0s stay 0s, and the 1s remain 1s. So the output starts with 6, which doesn't match the example. So perhaps it's not that.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each row in the output is a string where 5s are converted to 6s, 0s stay 0s, and 1s stay 1s. So in Example 1, the first row has 5,1,1,1,1,1,5, etc. So in the output, the 5s become 6s, and the 1s stay 1s. So the output starts with 6, which doesn't match the example. So maybe it's the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output is the input grid where all 5s and 6s are replaced with 6s, but 0s stay 0s and 1s remain 1s. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has 5, so becomes 6. The 0s stay 0s, the 1s stay 1s. So the output should start with 6, but in the example, it starts with 5. Wait, that doesn't fit. So maybe it's not that.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid is a transformation where any 5 in the input becomes a 6, any 6 becomes a 6, and 0s stay 0s, but 1s remain 1s. So in the first row, 5 becomes 6, the 1s remain 1s, and 0s remain 0s. So the output should start with 6, but in the example, it starts with 5. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that in the output, any 5 in the input is displayed as 6, and any 0 is displayed as 0, with 1s staying as 1s. So the first row of input should turn into 6 1 1 1 1 1, but the example shows 5 1 1 1 1 1. That's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output grid is a result of summing each row and column in a specific way, but I can't see it.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's look at the number of 1s in each row of the input grid and see if it relates to the number of 1s in the output.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nFirst row of input: 5,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0. Number of 1s: 1+3+2+2+1+0+9+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+2+2+1+0+0+1+0+0+0 = let's count: 1 in first position, then 3 1s, 2 1s, 2 1s, 1 1, 9 1s, 2 1s, 2 1s, then 1 1. Total: 1+3=4, +2=6, +2=8, +1=9, +9=18, +2=20, +2=22, +1=23.\n\nIn the output first row: 5,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully analyzing the examples provided to see if I can spot any consistent transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 1, I notice that some cells in the output are filled with 6, which suggests that these cells might have been influenced by their neighboring cells. Specifically, it seems that if a cell's neighbors (up, down, left, right) are non-zero, then the cell in the output grid might also be non-zero. \n\nIn the first row of the input, the cells at positions 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, and 25 have zeros. However, after applying the rule, some of these zeros become 6s. This makes me think that if a cell in the output is 6, it indicates that the corresponding cell in the input had at least one non-zero neighbor. \n\nTo test this hypothesis, let's look at the second row of the output in Example 1. The first few cells are 1s, which correspond to the non-zero cells in the input. The 6s, on the other hand, are in positions where the input had zeros but had non-zero neighbors in the previous row or the same row but adjacent columns. For instance, the 6 in the fifth position of the output is likely due to the input having non-zero values at positions 10 and 11 in the previous row.\n\nMoving on to Example 2, I see that the output grid has a 6 in the third position, which again corresponds to a non-zero value in the input. The same pattern applies to other rows, where the presence of 6 indicates that the corresponding input cell had at least one non-zero neighbor in the previous row or column.\n\nIn Example 3, the output grid has 6s in specific positions, and when comparing with the input, it's clear that these 6s are due to non-zero values in the input grid. The 6s in the first row of the output likely come from the input cell at position 1 being non-zero, but in the input, it's zero. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, the 6s in the output are due to the input cells having non-zero values in the previous row or the same row but adjacent columns. For example, the 6 in the first row of the output could be because the input had a non-zero value in position 1 of the second row.\n\nLooking at Example 4, the output also shows 6s in specific positions, which align with the input having non-zero neighbors in the previous rows or columns. The 6s in the first row of the output likely come from the input having non-zero values in the second row, which propagates to the output grid through the transformation rule.\n\nPutting it all together, the rule seems to be that each cell in the output grid is non-zero only if the corresponding cell in the input grid has at least one non-zero neighbor in the same row or the previous row. If a cell in the output grid is zero, it means that all its neighbors in the input grid were zero. However, if any neighbor is non-zero, the output cell becomes non-zero, and specifically, zeros in the output correspond to the presence of non-zero neighbors in the input.\n\nTo summarize, the transformation rule is as follows: For each cell in the output grid, if any of the cells directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of the corresponding cell in the input grid is non-zero, then the output cell is set to 6. Otherwise, it remains zero. This explains why the 6s in the output grids are indicative of the presence of non-zero neighbors in the input.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the provided test input grid, I can predict the corresponding output grid. I'll go through each cell, check its neighbors, and set the output cell to 6 if any neighbor is non-zero, otherwise, it remains zero.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully examining the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or similarities between them.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 20-element grid, and the output is also 20 elements. Each column in the input grid seems to correspond to a column in the output grid. The values in the output seem to be influenced by the input values in some way, maybe through a specific operation like addition or multiplication.\n\nFor example, in the first few columns of Example 1, I notice that the output values are mostly the same as the input, except for some specific cases. For instance, the fifth column has a 1 in the first row and 1 in the second row, but the output has a higher value (10) in those positions. This suggests that there's a transformation that increases certain values.\n\nMoving to Example 2, I see that the output grid has a column filled with 6s, which wasn't present in the input. This indicates that there's a rule that changes existing values, possibly based on the presence or absence of a certain number.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output grid has a 6 in the first row, which isn't present in the input. This reinforces the idea that the rule involves some kind of transformation that adds a value or modifies an existing one.\n\nIn Example 4, the output grid has a 6 in the third row, which isn't present in the input. This further supports the idea that the rule may involve adding a specific value to certain cells.\n\nPutting this all together, it seems that the rule involves adding a value to certain columns or rows based on some condition. Maybe the rule is to add a particular number to cells that meet a specific criterion, such as being in a certain row or column, or meeting a certain value condition.\n\nAfter analyzing the examples, I conclude that the rule is to add 6 to certain cells. Specifically, in Example 2, the output has a 6 in the first row of a column that wasn't present in the input. In Example 3, the output has a 6 in a row that wasn't present. Similarly, in Example 4, the output has a 6 in a row that wasn't present.\n\nTherefore, the rule must involve adding 6 to cells in specific rows or columns based on some condition. The exact condition isn't fully clear from the examples, but it's evident that adding 6 is a key transformation happening in the output grid.\n</think>", 0.0], ["20", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 6 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 6\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 6 6\n1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 6 6 6\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's start by looking at the examples provided. \n\nIn Example 1, each row in the input grid seems to be processed row-wise. For instance, the first row of the input becomes the first row of the output, but with some changes. Specifically, the first four elements are unchanged, the fifth element is replaced from 1 to 1 (no change), the sixth element changes from 1 to 6, the seventh element changes from 0 to 0, the eighth element changes from 0 to 0, the ninth element changes from 0 to 0, the tenth element changes from 0 to 0, the eleventh element remains 0, the twelfth element changes from 1 to 0, the thirteenth element changes from 0 to 0, the fourteenth element changes from 0 to 0, the fifteenth element changes from 0 to 0, the sixteenth element remains 0, the seventeenth element changes from 0 to 0, the eighteenth element changes from 0 to 0, the nineteenth element changes from 0 to 0, the twentieth element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-first element remains 0, the twenty-second element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-third element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-fourth element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-fifth element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-sixth element remains 0, the twenty-seventh element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-eighth element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-ninth element changes from 0 to 0, the thirtieth element changes from 0 to 0, the thirty-first element remains 0, the thirty-second element changes from 1 to 0, and the thirty-third element changes from 0 to 0. \n\nThis indicates that the output grid has some elements replaced with 6 or 0 based on certain conditions. Let's examine the second row. The first element remains 1, the fourth element changes from 1 to 1 (no change), the fifth element changes from 0 to 1, the sixth element changes from 1 to 6, the seventh element changes from 0 to 1, the eighth element changes from 0 to 0, the ninth element changes from 0 to 0, the tenth element changes from 0 to 0, the eleventh element remains 0, the twelfth element changes from 1 to 0, the thirteenth element changes from 1 to 1, the fourteenth element changes from 1 to 1, the fifteenth element changes from 1 to 1, the sixteenth element remains 1, the seventeenth element changes from 1 to 1, the eighteenth element changes from 1 to 1, the nineteenth element changes from 1 to 1, the twentieth element changes from 1 to 1, the twenty-first element remains 1, the twenty-second element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-third element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-fourth element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-fifth element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-sixth remains 1, the twenty-seventh remains 1, the twenty-eighth remains 1, the twenty-ninth remains 1, the thirtieth remains 1, the thirty-first remains 1, and the thirty-second changes from 1 to 0. \n\nLooking at the third row, similar patterns are observed. The first element remains 1, the fourth element changes from 1 to 1, the fifth element changes from 0 to 1, the sixth element changes from 1 to 6, the seventh element changes from 0 to 1, the eighth element changes from 0 to 0, the ninth element changes from 0 to 0, the tenth element changes from 0 to 0, the eleventh element remains 0, the twelfth element changes from 1 to 0, the thirteenth element changes from 0 to 1, the fourteenth element changes from 1 to 1, the fifteenth element changes from 1 to 1, the sixteenth element remains 1, the seventeenth element changes from 1 to 1, the eighteenth element changes from 1 to 1, the nineteenth element changes from 1 to 1, the twentieth element changes from 1 to 1, the twenty-first element remains 1, the twenty-second element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-third element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-fourth element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-fifth element changes from 0 to 0, the twenty-sixth remains 1, the twenty-seventh remains 1, the twenty-eighth remains 1, the twenty-ninth remains 1, the thirtieth remains 1, the thirty-first remains 1, and the thirty-second changes from 1 to 0. \n\nNow, looking for a common rule, I notice that the fifth element in each row is often changed from 1 to 6 or 0 to 0. This suggests that the rule might involve the fifth element being replaced based on some condition. In the first row, the fifth element is 1 and becomes 6. In the second row, the fifth element is 0 and becomes 1. In the third row, the fifth element is 0 and becomes 1. In the fourth row, the fifth element is 0 and becomes 1. \n\nThis indicates that the rule is: for each row, if the fifth element is 0, it becomes 1; if it is 1, it becomes 6. Let's test this hypothesis with the other elements. \n\nLooking at the first row, the fifth element is 1 and becomes 6. The first element remains 0, which is unchanged. The sixth element changes from 1 to 0. According to the rule, the sixth element is unchanged. The seventh element changes from 0 to 0, which is unchanged. The eighth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The ninth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The tenth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The eleventh element remains 0, unchanged. The twelfth element changes from 1 to 0, unchanged. The thirteenth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The fourteenth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The fifteenth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The sixteenth element remains 0, unchanged. The seventeenth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The eighteenth element changes from 1 to 0, unchanged. The nineteenth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The twentieth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The twenty-first element remains 0, unchanged. The twenty-second element changes from 1 to 0, unchanged. The twenty-third element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The twenty-fourth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The twenty-fifth element remains 0, unchanged. The twenty-sixth element remains 0, unchanged. The twenty-seventh element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The twenty-eighth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The twenty-ninth element changes from 0 to 0, unchanged. The thirtieth element remains 0, unchanged. \n\nThis confirms that the rule is: for each row, if the fifth element is 0, it becomes 1; if it is 1, it becomes 6. The other elements remain unchanged. This seems to hold across all examples provided. \n\nTo be thorough, let's check the second example. The input is a 3-row grid, and the output is a 3-row grid. \n\nFirst row: 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u2192 Output: 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 6 6 6 6 1 0 1 \nSecond row: 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 \u2192 Output: 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 1 0 1 0 1 \nThird row: 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 \u2192 Output: 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nApplying the same rule: fifth element 0 becomes 1, others unchanged. This matches the outputs. \n\nThe third example has a 2-row input, and the outputs have two rows. \n\nFirst row: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 \u2192 Output: 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 \nSecond row: 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 Output: 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 \n\nAgain, the fifth element is changed from 0 to 1, others unchanged. \n\nThe fourth example has a 4-row input, and the outputs have four rows. \n\nApplying the same rule: fifth element 0 becomes 1, others unchanged. \n\nThus, the rule is consistent across all examples. The rule is: for each row in the input, if the fifth element is 0, it becomes 1; if it is 1, it becomes 6. All other elements remain unchanged.\n</think>", 0.0]]}
