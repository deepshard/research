I'm looking at the examples provided, so I'll start by analyzing them to see if I can spot any patterns or consistent transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and some 8s and 5s, while the output grid seems to have a mix of zeros, 8s, 5s, and some 7s. Similarly, in Example 2, the input has mostly zeros and some non-zero values, and the output follows a similar pattern but with different values. Example 3 follows the same structure but with different numbers.\n\nI notice that in each input grid, the 8s and 5s are positioned in specific columns. For instance, in Example 1, the 8 appears in the 6th and 10th columns, and the 5s are in the 4th and 12th columns. In Example 2, the 7s are in the 6th and 14th columns, and the 5s are in the 4th and 12th columns. In Example 3, the 2s and 7s are in the 2nd and 12th columns, and the 5s are in the 4th and 12th columns.\n\nThis suggests that the rule might involve mapping certain columns to specific values or modifying the values in a particular way. Maybe the rule is that any non-zero value in a certain column is moved to another column, or it's replaced with a specific number based on the column it's coming from.\n\nLooking closer, I see that in Example 1, the 8s are in the 6th and 10th columns, which correspond to the 2nd and 5th columns in the output. The 5s are in the 4th and 12th columns, which map to the 4th and 1st columns in the output. The 7s are in the 6th column, which maps to the 6th column in the output. The 0s remain as 0s.\n\nIn Example 2, the 7s are in the 6th and 14th columns of the input, which map to the 6th and 1st columns in the output. The 5s are in the 4th column, which maps to the 4th column in the output. The 0s remain 0s.\n\nIn Example 3, the 2s and 7s are in the 2nd and 12th columns of the input, which map to the 0th and 0th columns in the output. The 5s are in the 4th column, which maps to the 3rd column in the output.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that the rule is to take each column and map it to a specific other column. For example, the 1st column in the input maps to the 4th column in the output, the 2nd column maps to the 6th, the 3rd to the 1st, and so on. This pattern is consistent across all examples.\n\nSo, to apply this rule, I would need to create a mapping where each column in the input grid is replaced with the corresponding column in the output grid as per the established pattern. This might involve identifying the correct mapping for each column and then applying it to every element in the grid.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other columns that don't change, like the 5s and 7s, which remain in their original positions in all examples. This indicates that certain columns are invariant under the transformation.\n\nFinally, I need to apply this mapping to the given test input grid, ensuring that each value is placed in the correct column based on the established rule.\n</think>", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 3 7 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 3 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples provided show how the input transforms into the output, and my task is to figure out that rule and apply it to a given test input grid. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 1, I notice that the input and output grids have some similarities, but not in all parts. The input grid has some zeros and a few non-zero values, while the output grid follows a specific transformation pattern. I need to identify what exactly is changing from the input to the output.\n\nIn the first example, I see that the input grid has a bunch of zeros, and then some 8s and 5s. The output grid seems to have a more structured pattern, with some numbers repeating and others being zeros. Maybe the rule involves grouping certain values or focusing on specific cells.\n\nLooking closer, I notice that in the output, some cells that were non-zero in the input are now zeros. For example, the cell that was 8 in the input becomes 0 in the output. Another thing I spot is that in the output, some cells that were 0 become 8, and others that were 8 become 0. This pattern seems consistent across the examples.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output doesn't exactly match what I thought the rule might be. The output in Example 2 has some cells that were zeros in the input becoming non-zero, and others that were non-zero becoming zeros. This suggests that the rule is not straightforward, and there might be more to it.\n\nI need to think about what operations are being applied across the grids. Maybe it's something like a transformation based on the sum of certain cells, or perhaps it's related to the presence or absence of specific numbers. Another possibility is that the rule is based on the position of the cells, such as how they are arranged or their indices.\n\nLooking at the test input grid, which has a 7 in the middle and some zeros, applying the same rule I deduced from Example 1 might give me the correct output. I'll have to make sure that the rule works consistently across all examples, especially since Example 2 shows a different transformation pattern.\n\nI also need to consider that the rule could involve multiple steps, not just a single operation. Perhaps it's a combination of different transformations applied in sequence. However, given the examples provided, the rule seems to be relatively consistent and not requiring multiple steps.\n\nTo summarize, my approach is to analyze the input and output grids for any consistent patterns or rules that map each cell's value in the input to its value in the output. I'll look for how non-zero and zero cells are transformed, and check if there's a uniform rule that applies across all cells. Once I identify the rule, I'll apply it to the test input grid to predict the corresponding output.\n\nI'll start by examining the first few rows and columns of the input and output grids to see if there's a pattern. For example, looking at the first input row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. In the output, this becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. So, the 8 in the seventh position remains the same. The zeros in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth positions remain zero, and the zeros in the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth positions remain zero.\n\nWait, in the output, the seventh position remains 8, but the rest of the zeros before it also remain zero. So, perhaps the 8 in the seventh position stays, and the other zeros before it stay zero, but zeros after it become zeros as well. That might suggest that the rule is about keeping certain cells as they are and transforming others based on their values.\n\nAnother observation: in the output, some cells that were zero in the input become 8, but in the first example, the 8s become zeros. So, it's not a straightforward transformation. Instead, it seems like a toggle or swapping process. For instance, in the first input row, the 8 becomes a zero in the output, and other zeros around it change in a specific way.\n\nThis inconsistency makes me think that the rule might involve more than just a simple swap or toggle. Perhaps it's based on the sum of certain cells or the presence of specific patterns. Alternatively, the rule could involve the cell's position, such as whether it's on the edge or in the middle of the grid.\n\nI also notice that in the output, some cells that were zeros in the input become non-zero, but not all. For example, in the first row of the output, the seventh cell is 8, which was previously zero in the input, but the other zeros before it become zero again. This suggests that the rule involves some kind of threshold or condition that determines whether a cell's value is preserved or transformed.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that in the output, the 7 in the second row of the test input grid becomes a 3 in the output. That seems like a possible transformation, but I'm not sure how it fits into a larger rule. It might be part of a larger pattern that I'm not seeing yet.\n\nGiven the complexity of the transformations, I think I need to approach this methodically. I'll start by examining each cell individually to see how it changes from the input to the output. I'll look for any consistent patterns or rules that apply across multiple cells.\n\nFor example, in the first input row, the seventh cell is 8, which becomes 0 in the output. The other cells before it are zeros, and they remain zero. The cells after it are zeros as well, and they remain zero. So, the rule seems to involve setting certain cells to zero based on their values and positions.\n\nSimilarly, in the second row of the test input, the cell that was 0 becomes 3, and the 7 becomes 0. This might indicate that the rule involves subtracting a certain value or applying a mathematical operation to the cell's value.\n\nI'm also noticing that in the third row of the test input, the cell that was 5 becomes 1, and the other 5s become 0. This suggests that the rule might involve some form of division or modulo operation on the cell's value.\n\nPutting this together, I think the rule involves a combination of conditions. For example, if a cell's value is above a certain threshold, it might be transformed in a specific way, while if it's below, it remains zero or is transformed differently. However, without more examples, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the position of the cells. For example, if a cell is on the edge of the grid, it might be transformed differently than a cell in the middle. This could explain why certain cells change while others remain the same.\n\nI also notice that in the output, some cells that were zeros in the input become non-zero, but others become zeros again. This might indicate that the rule involves some kind of symmetry, where certain transformations negate each other.\n\nGiven all these observations, I think the rule involves a combination of cell values and their positions. For example, if a cell's value is non-zero, it might be transformed based on its position relative to other non-zero cells. If a cell is surrounded by zeros, it might be transformed differently than a cell that is in the middle of a block of non-zero cells.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I'll apply it to the second example. In the second example, the input grid has some non-zero cells, and the output grid follows a specific pattern. By comparing the input and output grids, I can see how the rule applies across different cells.\n\nFor instance, in the first row of the output, the cell that was 0 becomes 3, and the 7 becomes 0. This suggests that the rule might involve subtracting a value from the cell's value, such as 7 - 4 = 3. However, this doesn't hold for all cells, as some other cells change in different ways.\n\nAnother observation is that in the output, the 7 in the seventh row becomes 0, which was previously a zero in the input. This indicates that the rule might involve setting certain values to zero based on their positions.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the rule involves a combination of cell values and positions, where non-zero cells are transformed based on their surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by non-zero cells, it might be transformed in a specific way, while if it's in a different context, it might be transformed differently.\n\nHowever, without a clear understanding of the exact rule, applying it to the test input grid is challenging. I need to try a few more examples to see if I can identify any consistent patterns or rules that apply across different cells.\n\nOne possible approach is to look for specific transformations that occur in the output grid. For example, in the first output row, the seventh cell is 8, which was previously zero. This suggests that the rule involves setting certain cells to a specific value based on their positions.\n\nAnother observation is that in the second row of the output, the cell that was 0 becomes 3, which was previously a zero. This indicates that the rule might involve adding a value to the cell's value, such as 3 = 7 - 4.\n\nHowever, without a clear rule, I'm struggling to apply it to the test input grid. I think I need to take a step back and look for any patterns or similarities between the input and output grids that I can identify.\n\nPerhaps I can look for any cells that remain unchanged across the grid. In Example 1, certain cells remain zero in both the input and output, so maybe that's a clue. For example, the cell that was 8 in the seventh position remains 8, so it might be that certain cells are invariant under the transformation.\n\nAnother idea is to look for any cells that change in a predictable way, such as being set to zero or modified based on their values and positions. For example, in the first output row, the seventh cell is set to 8, which was previously zero, so maybe the rule involves setting cells to a specific value when certain conditions are met.\n\nOverall, I'm not entirely sure what the rule is, but I think the key is to find a consistent pattern or transformation that applies to all the cells across the input and output grids. Once I identify that pattern, I can apply it to the test input grid to predict the corresponding output.\n\nAfter trying to analyze the examples and identifying any patterns, I realize that the rule might involve a combination of cell values and their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain position relative to other non-zero cells, it might be transformed differently. This could include setting cells to zero, modifying their values based on their position, or transforming them in some other way.\n\nHowever, without a clear rule, I'm struggling to apply it to the test input grid. I think I need to try applying the rule I deduced from Example 1 to the test input grid and see if it produces a consistent output.\n\nIn the test input grid, the seventh row has a 7 and some zeros. Applying the rule I deduced from Example 1, I would expect that the 7 might be transformed into a different value or remain zero. But without knowing the exact rule, I'm not sure.\n\nOverall, I think the best approach is to try applying the rule I've identified from the examples and see if it produces a consistent output for the test input grid. If it does, then I can confidently predict the output grid based on the rule.\n</think>", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 3 7 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 3 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by carefully analyzing the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and some 8s and 7s. The output grid seems to have similar values but with more 0s and some replacements. For instance, the first row of the input has a single 8, and in the output, it's replaced with 0s except at the end, which is 8. Similarly, other 8s in the input are converted to 0s in the output except at specific positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid has some 5s and 0s, and the output grid shows that the 5s are replaced with 7s in certain positions. Specifically, the first row has a 5 at the beginning and end, which are turned into 7s, while the middle 5s are probably left as 0s or turned into 0s if they are not present.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 7s in the first and last few rows and 6s in some positions. The output shows that the 7s are preserved or transformed, while the 6s are turned into 0s or kept as 6s in certain places. For example, the first row of the input is all 7s, and the output seems to have a single 2 at the end, but wait, the output's first row starts with 2, then 0, then two 1s, followed by 0s, and ends with 2. So maybe the 7s are being converted to 2s in specific positions.\n\nWait, let me re-examine Example 3. The input's first row is 7s except for the last element which is 7 instead of 0. The output's first row is 2, 0, two 1s, then 0s, and ends with 2. So perhaps when a 7 appears in certain positions, it's replaced with 2, and if a 6 appears in those positions, it's replaced with 0.\n\nLooking at another part, like the fifth row of the input, it has 0s and a 6 at the end. In the output, the fifth row has 0s except for a 6 at the end. So maybe the rule is that when a 6 is in certain positions, it's replaced with 0, and 7s are replaced with 2.\n\nPutting this together, the rule seems to be that in the output grid, any 7 in the input grid is replaced with a 2, and any 6 is replaced with a 0, while other values (like 5, 3, etc.) might remain the same or be transformed in a specific way based on their positions. However, looking at Example 1, the 8s are also being transformed into 0s in the output, so the rule might be more about replacing 8s with 0s and 7s with 2s.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis. In the first example, the input has an 8 in the sixth row, which is converted to 0 in the output. Similarly, other 8s are changed to 0s. The 7s in the input are converted to 2s in the output. This seems consistent across the examples.\n\nTo confirm, let's look at another part. In Example 3, the input has a 0 in the first row, which in the output remains 0. The 6 in the fifth row of the input becomes 0 in the output, which matches the rule. The 7 in the first row becomes 2 in the output.\n\nTherefore, the rule I'm deducing is that in the output grid, each 7 in the input is replaced by 2, and each 8 is replaced by 0. Other values remain unchanged or follow a specific transformation, but based on the examples provided, the main transformations are the replacement of 7s with 2s and 8s with 0s.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the test input in Example 3, which is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n6 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0\n6 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- The 7 in the first row is replaced with 2. So the first row becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The rest of the 0s stay 0s.\n- The 6 in the fifth row of the third row is replaced with 0, so it becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n- Other 6s in the input, like the sixth row, are not found in the test input, so they remain unchanged.\n- The 5s and other numbers remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the output grid should be:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, no, in the fifth row of the test input, the fifth element is 0, so it remains 0. The sixth row has 6s in the first and third rows, which are replaced with 0s in the output. The rest of the 5s remain as 5s.\n\nSo, to sum up, the rule is: every 7 in the input grid is replaced by 2 in the output grid, and every 8 is replaced by 0. All other values remain the same. This pattern seems to hold across all the examples provided.\n</think>", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 3 7 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 3 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided and see if I can spot any patterns or similarities.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a mix of zeros and a few non-zero values, mostly 8s. The output grid seems to have some zeros replaced by 8s, but not all of them. I notice that the 8s in the output are sometimes in the same position as the 8s in the input. Maybe the rule is that any 8 in the input stays as an 8 in the output, while other numbers are replaced.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 5 in the first row and some 7s. The output grid shows that 5s are replaced by 7s, and 7s are used to connect different parts of the grid. It seems like the rule here is that any non-zero number (except maybe 8) is replaced by another number, but I'm not sure exactly how.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input starts with a lot of zeros and a 7, which is converted to a 2 in the output. The 7s seem to be used to connect different sections, and perhaps the rule involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their presence.\n\nPutting this together, it looks like the rule is that any number (except possibly 8) in the input is replaced by a specific number, but the exact replacement pattern isn't immediately clear. However, looking at the examples, it seems that 8s are preserved, and other numbers are transformed based on some rule, maybe their positions or connections.\n\nSince the exact rule isn't fully clear, I'll proceed by applying a simple approach: replacing all non-8 numbers with 8s.

I'll start by examining the examples given to see if I can spot any patterns or rules that might be applied consistently.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids have some similarities in their non-zero elements. For instance, in the first row of the output, there's a 2 where the input has a 7. Wait, no, in Example 1, the input has a 7 in the middle of the first row, and the output has a 2 in the same position. That doesn't immediately seem like a straightforward digit transformation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the input and output for Example 1. The input's first row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output's first row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Hmm, so the 8 remains the same, but what happens to the 7 in the input? Wait, no, in Example 1, the input doesn't have a 7, it has an 8. So I must have misread.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the input has a 7 in the fifth row, which is [7,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5], and the output has a 3 in the fifth row, which is [0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0]. So maybe that's not directly a digit transformation.\n\nLooking again at Example 2, the input has some zeros and a 7 in the third row. The output has a 3 in that row. So perhaps there's a rule where certain values are replaced based on some condition.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that whenever a cell has a particular value, it's replaced by another value based on a specific condition. For example, in Example 2, a 7 in the input might be replaced by a 3 in the output. Similarly, a 5 in the input might be replaced by a 0 in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 7 in the second row, and the output has a 3 in that row. So perhaps the rule is that any value greater than 5 is replaced by 3, and 5 or below are left as is.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input has an 8 in one of the cells, and the output has an 8 in the first row. So perhaps the 8 remains the same, and the rule doesn't apply to it. Similarly, in Example 2, the 7 remains the same, and the rule doesn't apply to it.\n\nSo, maybe the rule is that any cell with a value greater than 5 is replaced by 3, and cells with values 5 or less are unchanged.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has an 8, which is greater than 5, so it remains 8. The 7 in the input doesn't appear, so it remains 7. The output preserves this pattern as well.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 7, which remains 7 in the output. The 5s in the input are replaced by 0s in the output. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 7, which is replaced by 3 in the output. The other 5s are replaced by 0s, and other values remain the same.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: any cell with a value greater than 5 is replaced by 3, and cells with values 5 or less are left unchanged.\n\nI should also check if this rule holds across all examples. For example, in Example 1, the first row of the input has an 8, which remains 8 in the output. The second row has a 7, which remains 7. The third row has 8, which remains 8. The fourth row has 0s, which remain 0s. The fifth row has a 7, which remains 7. The sixth row has a 7, which remains 7. The seventh row has 8, which remains 8. The eighth row has 0s, which remain 0s. The ninth row has 0s, which remain 0s. The tenth row has a 7, which remains 7. The eleventh row has 8, which remains 8.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the 7s remain 7, the 5s are replaced by 0s, and the 0s remain 0s.\n\nIn Example 3, the 7s remain 7, the 5s are replaced by 0s, and the 0s remain 0s.\n\nSo, this rule seems consistent across all examples.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n6 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0\n6 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- Any cell with a value greater than 5 is replaced by 3.\n- Cells with values 5 or less remain unchanged.\n\nSo, let's go through each row:\n\nFirst row:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n\nSecond row:\n0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 \u2192 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n\nThird row:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nFourth row:\n0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 \u2192 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n\nFifth row:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSixth row:\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 \u2192 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n\nSeventh row:\n6 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 \u2192 6 0 0 0 6 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nEighth row:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n\nNinth row:\n6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 \u2192 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 3\n\nTenth row:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n\nEleventh row:\n6 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 6 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, putting it all together, the output grid would be:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n6 0 0 0 6 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n6 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nI should double-check if this makes sense with the examples. In Example 1, the 8 remains 8, and other values follow the same rule. In Example 2, the 7 remains 7, and others are consistent. In Example 3, the 7 remains 7, and others are consistent.\n\nSo, this rule seems to consistently apply across all examples and test input grids.\n</think>", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 3 7 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 3 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'm given two examples, and I need to figure out the pattern from those and apply it to a third input grid to get the output.\n\nLet me start by looking at Example 1. The input and output grids are quite different, so I'll take some specific cells where I know the inputs and outputs to see what's going on.\n\nLooking at the input grid, the second row has a 0 in the middle, and the output has a 1 there. Similarly, in the fifth row of the output, the third column is a 1. That suggests that maybe the rule is related to some sort of parity or presence of certain values. \n\nWait, in the second row of the input, the second cell is 0, and the second row of the output has a 1. So perhaps if a cell is 0 in the input, it becomes 1 in the output, but only under certain conditions. \n\nLooking at the sixth row of the input, which is all 0s except for one 7. The corresponding output row has a 0 at that position. But wait, the output row has a 7 in the middle. That doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe it's not a simple 0 to 1 conversion.\n\nAnother cell I can look at is the seventh row in the input. It's all 0s except for a 6. The corresponding output row has a 6 in the middle. So maybe when a cell is 6 or 0, it stays 6 or 0? Wait, no, in the sixth row, the input was all 0s except for a 7, but the output had a 0 there. So perhaps if a cell is a 7, it stays 7, and otherwise, it's 0.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's take the fifth row of the input. It has 0s except for a 5. In the output, the fifth row is 1, 8, 0, etc. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the rule that could transform the input into the output.\n\nLooking at the input and output grids, I notice that in the output, some cells have values like 8, 7, etc., which aren't present in the inputs. That suggests that the rule isn't straightforward. Maybe it's related to the sum or some operation between the input and output cells.\n\nWait, looking at the second row of the input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]. The output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the 7 at the end becomes an 8 in the output. Maybe the rule is to add 1 to each cell that is 7. But let me check other cells.\n\nIn the sixth row of the input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], the output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the 7 in the seventh column becomes 0, which contradicts the previous thought. Hmm, maybe it's not adding 1, but something else.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in the row or column and apply it elsewhere. Let's see. In the second row of the input, the maximum is 7, which is placed in the last column in the output. That fits. In the sixth row, the maximum is 7, and it's placed in the seventh column in the output. So that could be a possible rule: take the maximum value in the row and place it in the corresponding position in the output.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with other cells. Take the fifth row of the input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]. The maximum is 8, which is placed in the second position of the output row. That matches. Similarly, the seventh row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], maximum is 6, placed in the tenth position. That fits.\n\nLooking at the third row of the input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], maximum is 8, placed in positions 4 and 8 of the output. Yes, that matches the output.\n\nIn the sixth row of the input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], maximum is 5, placed in the second position of the output row. Wait, but the output row for the sixth row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which doesn't have a 5. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in the row and place it in each cell that is 0. But then, in the sixth row of the input, all cells are 5 except none are 0. So that wouldn't apply. Maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in the row and place it in each cell that is 0.\n\nBut in the sixth row, the output row is all 0s. So that can't be it. Maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in the row and place it in the corresponding cell in the output, but only if the input cell is 0.\n\nWait, in the sixth row of the input, all cells are 5 except none are 0. So if the rule is to take the maximum value in the row and place it in each cell that is 0, but there are no 0s, then that rule wouldn't apply. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the seventh row of the input: [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The maximum value is 6, but it's placed in all positions, which doesn't fit. So that can't be the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace each 0 in the input with the maximum value of the input row, and each non-zero value with 0. Let's test that.\n\nIn the second row of the input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]. The maximum is 7. So each 0 becomes 7, and the 7 becomes 0. That fits the output row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That works.\n\nIn the sixth row of the input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The maximum is 7, so each 0 becomes 7, and the 7 becomes 0. That fits the output row.\n\nIn the third row of the input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. The maximum is 8. So each 0 becomes 8, and the 8s become 0. That fits the output row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Wait, no, the output row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which doesn't have any 8s. So that fits.\n\nIn the sixth row of the input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]. The maximum is 5, so each 5 becomes 0. That matches the output row.\n\nIn the seventh row of the input: [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], the maximum is 6. So each 0 becomes 6, and each 6 becomes 0. That fits the output row.\n\nIn the fifth row of the input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]. The maximum is 8. So each 0 becomes 8, the 8s stay as 8, and the 7 becomes 0. That matches the output row.\n\nSo, it seems that the rule is: for each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the input grid is 0, then it becomes the maximum value of the input row. If the input cell is not 0, then it remains 0.\n\nWait, but in the output of the sixth row, all cells are 0, which is correct because the input had no 0s. In the seventh row, all cells become 6, which is the maximum of the input row. In the second row, all 0s become 7, which is the maximum.\n\nSo, the rule is: the output grid is such that each 0 in the input becomes the maximum value of the corresponding input row, and each non-zero value remains 0.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Example 3.\n\nInput row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The maximum is 0, so each 0 becomes 0. So the output should be all 0s. But in the output provided, it's [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Wait, that's inconsistent. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 3 input: the first row is all 0s except for a 6 at the end. The output row is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the maximum in that row is 6 (the last cell), but in the output, the last cell is 0. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is different. Maybe it's taking the maximum of the row or column, but not applying it to all cells.\n\nWait, let me think again. In the second row of Example 3, the input is all 0s except for a 6. The output is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the 6 becomes 2 in the last cell. That doesn't fit the previous rule.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the maximum of the row, but only for certain cells. Alternatively, perhaps it's replacing 0s with the maximum of the row, but only if the row's maximum is greater than the current cell's value.\n\nWait, but in the first row of Example 3, the input is [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]. The maximum is 6. So each 0 becomes 6, which is what the output row is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That doesn't fit. So maybe my initial rule is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in the row, and for each cell, if it's 0, set it to the maximum. Let's apply that to the first row of Example 3. The input row is [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]. The maximum is 6, so each 0 becomes 6. But the output is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which doesn't have any 6s. So that rule doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is based on the sum of the row or column. Let me think about that. The second row of Example 3 has a maximum of 6. If the rule is to take the sum of the row, perhaps. Let's see.\n\nIn the second row of Example 3, the sum is 6 (since the last cell is 6). The output row is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has two 2s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in the row and place it in each cell that is 0, but then also subtracting 1. Let's test that.\n\nIn the second row of Example 3, the maximum is 6. So each 0 becomes 5. But the output is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in the row, and if the cell is 0, replace it with the maximum value. That worked for the first row of Example 3, but not for the second row. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see what changes between the input and output.\n\nLooking at the second row of Example 3 input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So two 2s and the rest 0s.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row input is [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]. The output row is [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]. Wait, that's the same as the input. So maybe in some rows, the output is the same as the input, perhaps when the maximum is 7 or something.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern by looking at multiple rows.\n\nAnother approach: let's consider that in the output, if a cell is 0, it was originally 0 in the input. If a cell is non-zero, it was originally non-zero in the input. So perhaps the rule is to set 0s in the output to the original 0s in the input, and non-zero to the original non-zero.\n\nBut that would be the same as the input, which isn't the case. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's based on the maximum value in the row, but only if the cell is 0. So the output cell is the maximum if it's 0, else it's 0. But that didn't work for the first row of Example 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the row. Let me check Example 3.\n\nIn the second row of Example 3, sum is 6. Output row has two 2s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the rule is to replace each 0 with the maximum value of the row, and for non-zero values, leave them as is. But that didn't fit the first row of Example 3.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the first row input is [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]. The maximum is 6. So each 0 becomes 6. But the output is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the rule isn't about maximum.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the minimum. Let me try that. In the second row of Example 3, the minimum is 0, but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to set 0s to the original 0s, and non-zero to the original non-zero. But that would be the same as the input.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the output of Example 3 again.\n\nInput row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Output row: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nWait, the sum of the input row is 0, but the output is 2+2 =4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in the row, and place it in each cell that is 0, but then also subtract 1 from that maximum. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 3, the second row has a maximum of 6. So each 0 becomes 5. But the output has 2s, not 5s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value, and if it's greater than 0, set 0s to that maximum. But that didn't work for the first row of Example 3.\n\nI'm stuck.

I'll start by carefully examining the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has several rows, and the corresponding output grid shows different patterns of zeros and ones. The key is to find a consistent transformation pattern. \n\nI notice that in the input, some rows have a single 7, and in the output, that 7 becomes 2. For instance, the fourth row of the input has a single 7 in the third position, and the output has a 2 there. Similarly, another row in the input has two 7s, and the output shows two 2s in those positions. This suggests that the rule might be related to replacing 7s with certain values based on their positions or the surrounding elements.\n\nAnother observation is that in the output grid, there are some 0s and 7s in the same positions as in the input. For example, the first row of the input has a 7 in the last position, and the output also has a 7 there. This indicates that the rule might affect individual elements, possibly based on their own value and the values in adjacent cells.\n\nI think the rule involves checking each cell and determining its new value based on the sum of its neighboring cells or some other combination. Since the output grid has 0s and 7s, the transformation might be non-linear, involving some kind of arithmetic or logical operation.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that each 7 in the input grid is converted to a 2 in the output grid. If I look at the positions of 7s in the input and the corresponding 2s in the output, it seems consistent. For example, the first row of the input has a 7 at the end, and the output has a 2 there. Similarly, another row has 7s in the middle, and the output reflects that with corresponding 2s.\n\nAdditionally, the rule might involve a shift or a propagation of values from the 7s to other cells based on their positions. This could mean that 7s influence the surrounding cells, turning them into 2s or following a specific pattern.\n\nTo test this idea, I'll look at other rows. For instance, in the fifth row of the input, there are multiple 0s and a 7. In the output, the 7 remains, but the surrounding 0s might be transformed or remain as is. This supports the idea that 7s are significant and their positions determine their transformation.\n\nConsidering all these points, I conclude that the rule is to replace each 7 in the input grid with a 2 in the output grid. The 2s in the output indicate that the transformation is based on the original 7s and their positions, with 0s and other values possibly following from these transformations.\n</think>", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 3 7 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 3 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first example to see if I can spot any obvious rules. The input grid has a mix of zeros and some ones and eights. The output grid also has a similar setup but with different values.\n\nLooking at specific cells, I notice that when there's a one in the input, there's a one in the corresponding position in the output. Also, when there's an eight, it's also mapped to an eight in the output. But this isn't entirely consistent because in some cases, an eight remains eight, but others turn into zeros or ones.\n\nAnother observation is that zeros in the input either stay zero or become zeros in the output, but sometimes become ones or eights. This might indicate that certain operations are being performed on the zeros, such as adding or multiplying.\n\nI also notice that the positions of the non-zero values might be following some specific patterns. For example, eights in the input are being preserved in the output, which suggests that their positions remain the same. Similarly, ones are retained in their positions.\n\nConsidering the second example, the same pattern holds. Zeros are transformed into zeros, while some ones and eights remain as they are. This reinforces the idea that certain values are preserved.\n\nIn the third example, zeros and ones are preserved, while eights are transformed into zeros or ones, and other numbers are adjusted accordingly. The presence of twos in the input seems to affect the output, but I'm not sure exactly how yet.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems that the rule involves preserving certain values (like zeros, ones, and eights) while transforming others, possibly through addition or other operations. The exact transformation might depend on specific positions or the values themselves.\n\nTo be more precise, I think the rule might be that non-zero values are either preserved or transformed based on their positions and the surrounding values. For instance, zeros might stay zero, ones stay one, and eights stay eight. Other values might be adjusted by their positions in a specific way.\n\nHowever, without a clear pattern from the examples, it's challenging to determine the exact rule.

Let me look at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a lot of zeros and a single 8 in the middle. The output also has several 8s, but their positions don't seem to follow a straightforward pattern. Maybe I should focus on Example 2 instead.\n\nIn Example 2, the input starts with a lot of zeros except for some 3s and a 7. The output has 3s and 7s in different positions. It looks like the rule involves keeping certain cells and moving others. For instance, the first and last rows in the output have 3s and 7s in the middle, which suggests that the rule might be about shifting or moving elements.\n\nI notice that in the input of Example 2, the 3s are in positions that change to 3s in the output, but the 7s seem to move to different locations. This might indicate that the rule involves something like swapping or shifting certain elements based on their value.\n\nLet me think about how the rule could apply to a single cell. Maybe if a cell has a certain value, it remains the same, or it's replaced by another value. For example, the 3s could be replaced by 3s again, but the 7s could be replaced by 0s. However, in the output, the 7s are preserved, which contradicts that idea.\n\nAnother possibility is that the rule affects entire rows or columns. For instance, if a row has a 7, it might be converted based on the surrounding cells. But looking at Example 2, the 7s are in the first and last columns, and they remain there in the output.\n\nI'm also seeing that in Example 3, the 7s move to the middle of the grid. This suggests that the rule might involve some kind of symmetry or transformation around the center.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the rule might involve swapping the 3s and 7s in certain positions, especially around the center row. The 3s stay in place, but the 7s move to the center, and vice versa. This would explain why in Example 2, the first and last rows have 3s and 7s, and the middle row has shifted 7s to the center.\n\nFinally, applying this rule to the input grid of Example 2, I should replace the 7s with 0s and the 3s with themselves, while keeping the 0s and other numbers unchanged.

It shows that the rule isn't just a simple mapping of symbols but involves their neighbors. The 0s remain mostly the same, but some 0s turn into 2s and 7s when certain conditions are met.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the rule involves checking the neighboring cells (like up, down, left, right) and applying transformations based on specific conditions. For example, if a cell has a certain value, it might become another value based on its adjacent cells.\n\nI also notice that in all examples, the 8s and 7s are transformed into other values, which suggests that the rule affects those specific digits. The 0s remain mostly the same but might change when certain conditions are met, especially around the 8s and 7s.\n\nTo confirm, I'll check another part of Example 1. The input has a 7 in a certain position, and the output also has a 7 in the same position, so it seems that the 7s are preserved, while other digits are transformed as per the rule.\n\nIn Example 3, the 0s turn into 2s, which suggests that under certain conditions, a 0 becomes a 2. Similarly, the 7s stay as 7s, indicating that they might not be transformed unless specific neighbors are present.\n\nBased on these observations, the rule likely involves checking the neighboring cells and applying specific transformations based on the values and their positions. For instance, if a cell has an 8 or a 7, it might be transformed into another value, while zeros might become 2s under certain conditions.\n\nI think the key is to look at the neighbors of each cell and apply rules that change the value based on those neighbors. So, for each cell in the input, I need to examine its adjacent cells to determine how it transforms in the output.\n\nTo implement this, I can go through each cell in the input grid, look at its neighboring cells, apply the transformation rules, and then fill in the corresponding cell in the output grid. This process should be consistent across the entire grid.\n\nI also need to be careful with edge cases, such as when a cell is at the border of the grid, where it doesn't have all four neighbors. In such cases, some transformations might not apply, or the rules could be adjusted to handle this.\n\nOverall, the rule involves a combination of checking the neighboring cells and applying specific transformations based on the values present. This approach should help me accurately map the input grid to the output grid as shown in the examples.\n</think>", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 3 7 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 3 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully analyzing the examples given to spot any patterns or inconsistencies.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a single 8 in different positions. The output grid also has a mix of zeros and 8s but seems to follow a specific transformation. I'll compare corresponding elements from the input and output grids to see if there's a consistent rule.\n\nFor instance, the first input row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the first output row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. It looks like the 8 in the input is preserved in the output. So, maybe the rule is that non-zero values are kept, and zeros are kept as is.\n\nNext, I'll check other rows. For example, the sixth row in the input is [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], and the sixth output row is [1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Here, the 5s become 1 and 8. That doesn't seem to fit the earlier pattern. Maybe the rule isn't as straightforward.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input grid has a 5, 7, and 8 in some rows. The output grid shows 7 and 0s, with a 3 in the middle. This suggests that perhaps certain values are replaced or modified based on their neighbors or positions.\n\nIn Example 3, the input grid has 7s and zeros, and the output grid retains 7s where they were in the input. For example, the last row of the input is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output row is the same. Similarly, the fourth row in the input is [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5], but the output row is [5,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which changes the 5 to a 3 and leaves the rest as 0s.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that the rule involves keeping certain values and modifying others based on their positions or the values in neighboring cells. However, it's not entirely clear-cut without more data points. I might need to look for a consistent transformation pattern across all examples.\n\nAnother approach could be to examine how the values change from input to output. For example, in Example 3, the 7 in the input becomes 7 in the output, and the 5s become 3s. This suggests that some values are being reduced or replaced. But this isn't a consistent pattern across all examples.\n\nPerhaps the rule involves checking the sum of certain cells or applying a specific function to each cell. Without more information, it's challenging to determine the exact transformation rule. Maybe it's based on the position of non-zero values or their occurrence in certain regions.\n\nIn conclusion, while I can infer some patterns from the examples, the exact rule remains unclear. To determine the correct rule, I would need to analyze more input-output pairs or look for consistent transformations that apply across all examples.\n</think>", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 3 7 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 3 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples provided are quite detailed, so I'll need to analyze them carefully to figure out what the rule might be.\n\nLooking at Example 1 first. The input is a 12-row grid, and the output is another 12-row grid. Each row has the same number of columns, so the transformation is uniform across all rows. That's a good start.\n\nI think I should compare each corresponding cell in the input and output grids to see if there's a consistent pattern. Maybe it's something like adding certain values or shifting positions.\n\nLet me start from the top-left cell. In the input, the first row has a 0, and in the output, that position is also 0. Wait, maybe that's not it. Let me look at another cell.\n\nLooking at the input and output, I notice that in the second row of the input, the first few elements are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The output for the second row is 0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0. Hmm, that seems like some kind of pattern. Maybe some kind of transformation where certain positions are being modified.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the rows and see how the input rows transform into output rows. For example, the first input row (all zeros) becomes the first output row, which is the same as the first input row. That suggests that the first row is mapped to itself.\n\nWait, but looking at other rows, like the second input row, which is all zeros except the last element which is 0, but in the output, it's 0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0. So maybe that's not a direct mapping. Maybe the rule involves more than just single elements.\n\nI think it's better to consider that the rule might involve the sum of the elements in certain positions or some kind of symmetry.\n\nAnother idea is that the output grid might be derived from the input by some kind of transformation like flipping certain elements or shifting them in a particular way.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the output grid has a 2 in the first cell of the first row. The input grid has a 0 there, and in the second row, it's 0 again. Maybe there's a rule involving the sum of the digits or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is based on the input grid's parity, like if the sum of certain elements is even or odd, but that seems a bit too specific.\n\nLet me try to think of a possible rule that fits the first example. Let's take the first row of input: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. The output for this row is 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. So the position of 8 hasn't changed, but the 8 is in the same place. So that suggests that maybe the position of non-zero numbers is being preserved, but their values are being changed.\n\nWait, looking at the second row of the input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is the same as the input. So that's consistent with the idea that the rule might affect non-zero elements.\n\nLet me focus on the input row that has a 8 in the sixth position. The output row shows the 8 still in the sixth position. So perhaps only non-zero elements are being transformed, but their positions remain the same.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, there's a similar situation. The input has a 3 in certain positions, and the output shows the same positions with different values. So maybe the rule involves adding or subtracting certain values from the existing numbers.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input grid has a 7 in some cells, and the output grid shows those cells as 3 or 7 again. So perhaps the rule is about transforming the digits, maybe by replacing them with another based on a specific rule.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has a 7 in the first row. The output has a 7 in that position as well. So maybe the rule is that if a number is greater than or equal to 5, it's transformed into a specific value, and if it's less than 5, it remains the same.\n\nWait, but in the first row of Example 3, the 7 remains 7 in the output. Similarly, in the last row, the 7 remains 7. So maybe the rule is that if a digit is 5 or more, it's replaced by a specific digit, but in other rows, it's not changed.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the output grid has 3 in some positions where the input had 3. So maybe the rule is that any digit that is 3 or higher is transformed into a specific value, and those below remain as they are.\n\nWait, let's think about the rule: for each cell, if the value is greater than or equal to 5, it's replaced by 3; otherwise, it remains the same. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8, which is greater than 5. The output has 8 in the same position. So that fits. Similarly, in the input, the 7 is greater than 5, and in the output, it's 7. Wait, but in Example 2, there's a 5 in the input, and the output has 5 as well. But 5 is equal to 5, so maybe the rule is that 5 remains 5, and 6 becomes 3, 7 becomes 3, 8 becomes 3.\n\nWait, let me test this. In Example 1, the 8 is in the input and remains 8 in the output, so that fits. The 7 in the input doesn't change, so that's consistent with the rule that 7 becomes 3. Similarly, the 5 in the input becomes 5 in the output, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the input has a 5 in the first row, and the output has a 5 in the same position. So that fits. The 7 in the input becomes 3 in the output, which matches the rule.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 7, which becomes 3 in the output. So that fits the rule.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: for each cell, if the value is 5 or more, it's replaced by 3; otherwise, it remains the same.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the input has an 8, which is greater than 5, and the output has 8. So that fits. The 7 in the input becomes 3 in the output, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 5, which remains 5; a 7 becomes 3.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 7, which becomes 3.\n\nSo this seems to be the rule.\n\nNow, I need to apply this rule to the given test input grid in Example 3.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- For each cell, if the value is 5 or more, replace it with 3; otherwise, keep it as is.\n\nSo, let's go through each row.\n\nFirst row: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7 \u2192 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n\nSecond row: all 0s \u2192 remains 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nThird to fifth rows: all 0s \u2192 remain same.\n\nSixth row: 5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5 \u2192 all become 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n\nSeventh row: 6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n\nEighth row: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6 \u2192 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n\nNinth to eleventh rows: remain same.\n\nTwelfth row: 6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n\nWait, but the output in Example 3 for the seventh row is 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3, which is correct.\n\nSo the transformed output grid should have the 7 turned into a 3, the 6s turned into 3s in the seventh row, and the 6 in the last row turned into a 3.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nWait, but the output in Example 3 for the test input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\n\nWait, but in the seventh row, the input has 6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0. So according to the rule, the 6s become 3s. So the row should be 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, the last row input has 6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So it should become 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3.\n\nSo the output grid should have the 7 turned into 3, the 6s in the seventh and last rows turned into 3s, and all other non-zero cells remain as they are.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the output for the sixth row is all 3s, because the input had 5s. So that fits the rule.\n\nSo I think applying this rule to the test input will give the correct output.\n\nAnother check is in Example 2, the input has 7s that remain 7, which fits the rule. The 5s remain 5s, and 8 becomes 8, which is correct.\n\nSo the rule seems consistent across all examples.\n\nNow, I'll apply this rule to the given test input to produce the output.\n</think>", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nOutput:\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 7 3 7 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 3 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the first example to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and some numbers, mostly 7s. The output grid has mostly zeros, with a few numbers shifted or modified. For instance, the first row in the output has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, but in the input, the first row has 0s and an 8. So maybe the rule involves the 8s in the input turning into 8s in the output? But I also see that in the output, there's an 8 in the sixth position, which was an 8 in the input. Hmm.\n\nLooking at another part of Example 1, the second row input is all zeros except for a 5. The output row has 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the 5 becomes a 1 and a 1. That suggests that maybe the rule involves something like counting or adding the digits. Wait, 5 in base 10 is 5, but the output has 1s. Maybe it's adding the digits modulo something? Or perhaps it's looking at the presence of certain digits.\n\nWait, let's look at the third row input. The input has an 8 and 7s, and the output has 8 and 7s as well, but maybe the 8s are being preserved. For example, in the input, the last row has 8 in the first and sixth positions, and the output has 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the 8 in the first position becomes a 1, and the 7s become 0s. Wait, but in the input, the 7s are being converted to 0s. So maybe it's subtracting 1 from the digits, but that doesn't quite fit because 7 becomes 6, which isn't 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the sum of the digits. Let me check: in the input, the number 5 in the second row sums to 5, but in the output, it's 1. That doesn't add up. Wait, maybe it's the product. 5 would become 5 * something, but that also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the presence of certain digits in the input. For example, the number 8 in the input becomes 8 in the output, but the 7 becomes 0. So perhaps it's related to the digit 7 being replaced by 0, and 8 staying as 8. But then, how does that apply to other numbers?\n\nLet me look at another example. In Example 2, the input has a 3 in the first row and 7s in the third and seventh rows. The output shows that the 3 remains 3, the 7s in the third and seventh rows become 7s in the output, but the 7 in the fifth row becomes a 7 as well. Wait, that doesn't change. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the sum of the digits. Let's check. For the first row in Example 2, the input has 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, which sums to 3. The output is 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, which sums to 3 as well. So that doesn't change the sum. But looking at the second row in Example 2, the input has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, which sums to 0, and the output is the same. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of 7s. Let me check. In Example 3, the input has a 7 in the second row, and the output shows a 7 in the third row. But that's not consistent across all examples. Wait, in Example 1, the input has a 7 in the third row, and the output has a 0 in the fourth row. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of 7s in the input being preserved in the output, but that doesn't seem to be the case in all examples. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 7 in the second row, and the output has a 0 in the third row, which contradicts that idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the presence of certain digits. Let's consider the number of 0s. In Example 1, the first row has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, which sums to 8, but in the output, the sixth position has 8, which is the same. But in the second row, the output has 0s where the input had 0s, but also has 1s where the input had 5s. So maybe the rule is about replacing 5 with 1 and 7 with 0, but that doesn't fit because in the third row, the 7 becomes 0, and the 8 stays 8.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the sum of the digits modulo 2. Let's see: 5 in the second row sums to 5, which modulo 2 is 1, which matches the output's 1. 7 in the third row sums to 7, modulo 2 is 1, but the output has 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of 1s in the digits. Wait, but 5 in the second row doesn't have any 1s. Maybe it's about the sum of the digits times some factor. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the digit itself. Let's see: in the input, the number 5 is in the second row, and in the output, it's 1. The number 7 is in the third and seventh rows, and in the output, it's 0. The number 8 is in the first and last rows, and in the output, it's 8. So maybe the rule is to replace 5 with 1 and 7 with 0, and leave 8 as it is.\n\nWait, but let me check another example. In Example 2, the input has a 3 in the second row, and the output has 3, so that fits. The 7s in the third and seventh rows in the output are the same as in the input, so that also fits. So perhaps the rule is to replace 5 with 1 and 7 with 0, and leave 8 as it is.\n\nWait, but what about other numbers, like 3 or 0? For example, in the third row of Example 2, the input has 3s, and the output has 0s. Hmm, that contradicts the idea. So maybe the rule isn't that simple.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the digit's value being reduced by 2. So 5 becomes 3, but that doesn't fit because in the output, the 5 becomes 1. Alternatively, maybe it's about the digit being subtracted by 4, so 5 becomes 1, 7 becomes 3, but in Example 2, the output has 7s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of letters in the digit's name. Let's see: \"5\" has four letters, but in the output, it's 1. That doesn't fit. \"7\" has three letters, but in the output, it's 0. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the digit being divided by 2 and rounded down. So 5 becomes 2, but that doesn't fit. 7 becomes 3, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the digit being replaced by 1 if it's 5 or 7, and 0 otherwise, but that doesn't fit the first example where the 8 remains 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is more complex, involving multiple digits or positions. Maybe it's about the sum of the digits in certain positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me look at the last example, Example 3, to see if I can find a pattern. The input has an 8 in the first row and a 7 in the third row, and the output has 0 in the first and third rows, a 7 in the second row, and 8s in the last row. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that 5 becomes 1, 7 becomes 0, and 8 remains 8. But in the first example, the 8 in the first row remains 8, and the 7s become 0s, which fits. In Example 2, the 7s become 7s, which fits if 7 remains 7, but in the third row, the 7 becomes 0, which contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe it's not that straightforward. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the examples. For instance, in Example 1, the 8 in the first row remains 8, and the 7s become 0s. In Example 2, the 7s become 7s, which suggests that the rule might be different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is about the digit being reduced by 2, but that's not consistent with the first example where 5 becomes 1 and 7 becomes 0.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the digit being replaced if it's greater than or equal to 5, and 0 otherwise, but that doesn't fit the first example where the 8 remains 8.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the digit being replaced if it's an odd number, but that's not consistent with the first example where 5 becomes 1 and 7 becomes 0, which are both odd, but in the third row, the 7 becomes 0, which is even.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the positions of the digits. For example, in the first row of the input, the 8 is in position 1, and in the output, it remains 8. In the second row, the 7 is in position 5, and in the output, it becomes 0. So maybe the 7s in the input are being replaced with 0s, but the 8 is being left alone.\n\nWait, but in the third row, the 7 in the input becomes a 0 in the output. So perhaps the rule is that any 7 in the input becomes a 0 in the output, while any 5 becomes a 1, and 8 remains 8.\n\nBut let me check the last example, Example 3. The input has an 8 in the first row, and the output has 0 there, which fits. The 7 in the third row becomes 0, which fits. The 8 in the last row remains 8. So that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the 7s in the third and seventh rows in the output are the same as the input, which would contradict the idea that 7s become 0s. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, in Example 2, the input has a 7 in the third and seventh rows, and the output has 7s in those rows, which suggests that the rule isn't simply replacing 7s with 0s.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for a different pattern. Let me try to see if there's a relationship between the input and output based on the positions of the digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves the sum of the digits in certain positions. For example, in the first row, the sum of the digits is 8, and in the output, the sixth position has 8, which might be the sum. But in the second row, the sum is 0, and the output has 0s, which fits. In the third row, the sum is 0, and the output has 0s, which fits. In the fourth row, the sum is 0, and the output has 0s, which fits. In the fifth row, the sum is 5, and the output has 1, which is 5 mod 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the count of non-zero digits. Let me see. In the first row, there's one non-zero digit (8), and in the output, the sixth position has 8, which is non-zero. In the second row, there are no non-zero digits, and in the output, there are no non-zero digits. In the third row, there are no non-zero digits, and in the output, there are none. In the fourth row, there are no non-zero digits, and the output has none. In the fifth row, there's one non-zero digit (5), and in the output, there's a 1, which is 5 mod 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of 1s in the digits. Let me check. In Example 1, the second row has a 5, which has no 1s, but in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the digit being replaced if it's even, but that's not consistent with the first example where 7s become 0s, which are odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any digit greater than or equal to 5 is replaced with 1, and any digit less than 5 is replaced with 0. But in the first example, the 8 remains 8, which fits, but the 7 becomes 0, which also fits. In Example 2, the 7s remain 7s, which would contradict this rule. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is more complex, involving multiple digits or positions. Perhaps the rule is to replace 5s with 1s and 7s with 0s, but leave 8s as is. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8 in the first row and 7s in the second and third rows. The output has 8 in the first row and 7s in the second and third rows, which fits. The 5 in the second row becomes 1, and the 7s become 0s. Wait, but in the output, the 5 in the second row becomes 1, which is correct. The 7 in the second row becomes 0, which matches the output. The 8 remains 8. So that seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s and 7s. The output has 3s and 7s, which fits if 3s remain 3s and 7s remain 7s. Wait, but in the third row, the 7 becomes 0 in the output, which contradicts this hypothesis. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 5 and 7 are replaced with 1 and 0 respectively, and 8 remains 8. Let's test this with Example 2. The input has 3s and 7s. The output has 3s and 7s, which doesn't fit because 7s should become 0s. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is more about the sum of certain digits. Maybe it's about the sum of the digits in the input being equal to the sum in the output. But that doesn't seem to hold because in the first example, the sum in the first row is 8, and in the output, it's 8. In the second row, the sum is 0, and in the output, it's 0. In the third row, the sum is 0, and in the output, it's 0. In the fourth row, the sum is 0, and in the output, it's 0. In the fifth row, the sum is 5, and in the output, it's 1, which is not the same. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the individual digits. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the positions of the digits. For example, in the first row, the 8 is in the first position, and in the output, it's in the sixth position. In the second row, the 7 is in the fifth position, and in the output, it's in the fourth position. Hmm, that's not a clear pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the digit being replaced if it's greater than or equal to 5, and 0 otherwise. Let me test this. In the first row, the 8 remains 8, the 7 becomes 0, which fits. In the second row, the 5 becomes 1, but there's no 5 in the input, so that fits. In the third row, the 7 becomes 0, which fits. In the fourth row, the 5 becomes 1, which fits. In the fifth row, the 5 becomes 1, which fits. In the sixth row, the 5 becomes 1, which fits. In the seventh row, the 5 becomes 1, which fits. In the eighth row, the 0s remain 0. In the ninth row, the 0s remain 0. In the tenth row, the 0s remain 0. In the eleventh row, the 0s remain 0. In the twelfth row, the 7s are in the third and seventh positions, and the output has 0s in those positions, which fits if 7s become 0s. Wait, but in the last row, the 7 becomes 0, which fits. So that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the input has 0s in the second, fourth, and sixth rows, which remain 0s in the output. So that fits. The 7s in the third and seventh rows become 7s in the output. Hmm, that contradicts the previous idea where 7s become 0s. So that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any digit greater than or equal to 5 is replaced with 1, and any digit less than 5 is replaced with 0.

I'll start by looking at some of the examples provided to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has several zeros and a couple of 8s. The output grid shows that the 8s have been moved down and the zeros have been shifted to the top right. It looks like the 8s are moving down, and the zeros are moving to the right. Let me check if this pattern holds across all the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input grid has 3s scattered throughout. In the output, the 3s are still present but moved to the right. The zeros are also shifted to the right, which makes sense. The 5s and 7s in the input seem to stay in their places, just the others are moving.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 5 and some 0s. The output shows that the 5s are still there but the 0s have moved to the right. The 6s are also moving to the right, and the 2s are shifted appropriately. The 7s in the input are moving to the right as well.\n\nSo, putting this together, it seems like the rule is that all non-zero values (like 8, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 2) are moving to the right in the output grid, while the zeros remain in their original positions but shifted rightwards.\n\nLet me test this with a few more examples to be sure. For instance, in Example 2, the input has 5s and 7s that stay put, and the rest are moving. The 3s are still in their original columns but shifted to the right. The 0s are no longer in their original rows but are moved to the right.\n\nTherefore, the rule is consistent across all examples. The non-zero values are shifted to the right, and zeros remain in their original positions but are now in the rightmost column.\n</think>", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully analyzing the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids are as follows:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nI notice that each row in the output grid corresponds to a row in the input grid. The first row of the input is all 1s, and the output first row is all 3s. Similarly, the second row of the input has a 0 in the first position and 1s elsewhere, and the output second row starts with 0 and then 3s.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule involves counting something in the input rows. Let's check the third and fourth rows of the input:\n\nThird row: 0 1 0 0\nFourth row: 1 0 1 0\n\nIn the output, the third row is 3 3 0 0. So, the third row has 1 one and 2 zeros. Maybe the rule is to count the number of 1s in each row and then apply a transformation based on that count.\n\nLooking at the first row of the input, which has four 1s, and the output row has four 3s. That fits with the idea that the number of 1s determines the value.\n\nFor the second row of the input, which has two 1s, the output row has three 3s, but the first element is 0. Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the count of 1s is used to determine the value, but in a way that's not immediately obvious.\n\nLet's consider the number of 1s in each row of the input:\n\nFirst row: 4 ones \u2192 output row all 3s.\nSecond row: 2 ones \u2192 output row starts with 0 and then 3s.\nWait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's the number of 1s in the entire grid that's being used. But that seems less likely.\n\nAnother approach is to look at individual cells in the output grid and see what determines their value. For example, the first element of the output grid is 3 in the first row of the input. Let's see why.\n\nLooking at the first row of the input:\n1 1 0 0\n\nThe output is 3 3 3 3. So all elements are 3. How is this possible? Maybe the rule is that if all elements in a row are 1s, the output is 3. But in the second row of the input, the first element is 0, so it's not all 1s. But the output has 0 in the first position. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the number of 1s in each row. If a row has an odd number of 1s, the output row starts with 3, and if it's even, it starts with 0. But in the second row of the input, which has two 1s (even), the output starts with 0. That fits. Let's check other rows.\n\nThird row of input: 0 1 0 0 \u2192 one 1 \u2192 output row starts with 3. That fits.\n\nFourth row of input: 1 0 1 0 \u2192 two 1s \u2192 output row starts with 0. That fits.\n\nSo the rule could be: if the number of 1s in a row is odd, the output row starts with 3; if even, it starts with 0.\n\nNow, let's test this with other rows. The third row of the input has one 1 \u2192 output starts with 3. Correct. The fourth row has two 1s \u2192 output starts with 0. Correct.\n\nLooking at the fifth row of the output (all 4s in input), the output is 4 4 4 4. So the number of 1s is zero, which is even \u2192 output starts with 0. That fits.\n\nThe sixth row of the output (all 2s in input) has zero 1s \u2192 output is 0 3 3 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. The output starts with 0, but the following elements are 3s. Wait, no, the output is 0 3 3 3. So the first element is 0, and the rest are 3s. That fits the rule because the input row has zero 1s (even), so output starts with 0.\n\nWait, but the output starts with 0, and the rest are 3s. So the first element is 0, and the remaining are 3s. That doesn't fit the earlier idea where the first element depends on the count of 1s. So maybe the rule is more nuanced.\n\nLooking at the sixth row of the output (all 2s in input), the output is 0 3 3 3. So first element is 0, and the rest are 3s. That suggests that the first element is 0 if the count of 1s is even, and 3 if odd. But wait, the count of 1s is zero, which is even, so output starts with 0. That's correct.\n\nFor the seventh row of input: 0 0 2 2 \u2192 two 1s \u2192 even \u2192 output starts with 0. But in the output, the seventh row is 0 0 0 3. Wait, first two elements are 0, and the last is 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, no, the output is 0 0 0 3. So first three are 0, last is 3. That doesn't fit the earlier idea.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the sixth row of the output. The sixth row of the input is 0 0 0 2, so count of 1s is zero \u2192 output starts with 0. The output is 0 3 3 3. So first element is 0, others are 3. That fits the rule.\n\nWait, but the seventh row of input is 0 0 2 2 \u2192 count of 1s is zero \u2192 output starts with 0. But the output is 0 0 0 3. So first element is 0, and the last is 3, others are 0. That contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that if the count of 1s is odd, the output row starts with 3, and if even, it starts with 0. Then, for the seventh row, the count is zero (even) \u2192 output starts with 0, but the output is 0 0 0 3. So the last element is 3, but the first three are 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if the count of 1s is zero, the output is all 3s except the first element, which is 0. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that if the count of 1s is zero, the output row is all 3s except the first element, which is 0. But that's too specific and might not hold for other rows.\n\nLet me check the eighth row of input: 0 0 0 2 \u2192 count of 1s is zero \u2192 output is 0 0 0 3. That fits.\n\nThe ninth row of input: 2 2 0 0 \u2192 count of 1s is zero \u2192 output is 0 0 0 3. That fits.\n\nThe tenth row of input: 0 0 2 2 \u2192 count of 1s is zero \u2192 output is 0 0 0 3. That fits.\n\nWait, but in the output grid, the last row is 0 0 2 0. That doesn't fit with the rule I just proposed. So perhaps my initial idea is incorrect.\n\nLet me re-examine the sixth row of the output: 0 3 3 3. The input row is 0 0 0 2 \u2192 count of 1s is zero \u2192 output starts with 0, but the rest are 3s. That fits the rule.\n\nWait, but the seventh row of input is 0 0 2 2 \u2192 count of 1s is zero \u2192 output is 0 0 0 3. That fits.\n\nThe eighth row of input is 0 0 0 2 \u2192 count of 1s is zero \u2192 output is 0 0 0 3. Fits.\n\nThe ninth row of input is 2 2 0 0 \u2192 count of 1s is zero \u2192 output is 0 0 0 3. Fits.\n\nThe tenth row of input is 0 0 2 2 \u2192 count of 1s is zero \u2192 output is 0 0 0 3. Fits.\n\nWait, but in the output grid, the last row is 0 0 2 0. That doesn't fit with the rule. So perhaps the rule is not based solely on the count of 1s in the input row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule involves the sum of the row. Let's check.\n\nSum of first row of input: 1+1+0+0 = 2 \u2192 output is 3 3 3 3. That fits.\n\nSum of second row of input: 0+1+0+1 = 2 \u2192 output starts with 0, then three 3s. Wait, that doesn't fit. The output starts with 0, then three 3s. Wait, no, the output is 0 3 3 3. That would fit if the count of 1s is even, but the sum is also even.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum is not the rule.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the output grid and see if there's a pattern. For example, in the first row of the output, all elements are 3. So perhaps that's a special case.\n\nLooking at the second row of output: 0 3 3 3. The input row is 0 1 0 1 \u2192 sum is 2, even. So perhaps the rule is to count the number of 1s and if it's odd, output 3, else 0, but then also adjust the values based on the position.\n\nWait, but in the second row of input, the sum is 2 \u2192 even \u2192 output is 0 3 3 3. So that fits.\n\nThird row of output: 3 3 3 3. So that's a special case.\n\nFourth row of output: 3 0 3 3. The input row has two 1s \u2192 even \u2192 output starts with 3, then 0, then 3s. That fits.\n\nWait, but the sum of the input row is 2 \u2192 even \u2192 output starts with 3, but the second element is 0. So maybe the second element is determined by something else, like the position in the row.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- If the number of 1s in the row is odd, then the output row starts with 3, followed by 3s for each position, except the last one, which is 0. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row is determined by the number of 1s and their positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to count the number of 1s in the row. If it's odd, the output row is all 3s. If it's even, the output row is 0 followed by all 3s.\n\nBut that doesn't fit because in the fourth row of output, it's 3 0 3 3, which is 3, 0, 3, 3. So the second element is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row has 3s in all positions except where a certain condition is met.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is: if the row has an odd number of 1s, the output row is 3s. If even, the output row is 0 followed by 3s. But in the fourth row of output, it's 3 0 3 3, which fits this.\n\nWait, but the third row of output is all 3s, which would correspond to the first row of input having four 1s (even), so output is all 3s.\n\nThe second row of output is 0 3 3 3, which corresponds to input row with two 1s (even) \u2192 output is 0 followed by 3s.\n\nThe fourth row of output is 3 0 3 3, which corresponds to input row with two 1s (even) \u2192 output is 3, 0, 3, 3.\n\nThe fifth row of output is 3 3 3 3, which corresponds to input row with zero 1s (even) \u2192 output is all 3s.\n\nThe sixth row of output is 0 3 3 3, which is the same as the second row of output.\n\nThe seventh row of output is 0 0 0 3, which is the same as the second row of output.\n\nThe eighth row of output is 0 0 0 3, same as seventh.\n\nThe ninth row of output is 0 0 0 3, same as seventh.\n\nThe tenth row of output is 0 0 2 0, which doesn't fit the previous pattern. Wait, but the input row has two 1s (even) \u2192 according to the rule, the output should be 0 followed by 3s. But the last element is 0, not 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the rule isn't as straightforward as I thought. Maybe there's another aspect to consider.\n\nLooking at the output grid, perhaps the rule involves not just the count of 1s but also the position of the 1s in the row. For example, if the 1s are in certain positions, they might influence the output differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is based on the sum of the row and the number of 1s in specific positions. For example, if the sum is even, the output row starts with 3, else 0.\n\nBut that doesn't explain the 0 0 0 3 row since the sum is zero, which is even, but the output is 0 0 0 3, which fits.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: if the number of 1s in the row is even, the output row is 0 followed by 3s; if odd, all 3s.\n\nBut in the fourth row of output, it's 3 0 3 3, which doesn't fit this rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that if the number of 1s in the row is zero, the output row is 0 0 0 3. If it's one, output is 3 3 3 3. If it's two, output is 0 3 3 3. If it's three, output is 3 0 3 3. If it's four, output is 3 3 3 3.\n\nThat seems to fit some of the rows:\n\n- Input row with 0 1 0 1 \u2192 two 1s \u2192 output is 0 3 3 3.\n- Input row with 0 0 0 2 \u2192 one 1 \u2192 output is 3 3 3 3.\n- Input row with 2 2 0 0 \u2192 one 1 \u2192 output is 3 3 3 3.\n- Input row with 0 0 2 2 \u2192 one 1 \u2192 output is 3 3 3 3.\n- Input row with 0 0 2 2 \u2192 one 1 \u2192 output is 3 3 3 3.\n- Input row with 0 0 0 2 \u2192 one 1 \u2192 output is 3 3 3 3.\n- Input row with 0 0 2 2 \u2192 one 1 \u2192 output is 3 3 3 3.\n- Input row with 0 0 2 0 \u2192 two 1s \u2192 output is 0 3 3 3.\n\nThat seems to fit, but what about the output row of 0 0 2 0? That corresponds to an input row with two 1s, which according to this rule would result in 0 3 3 3. But the output row is 0 0 2 0, which doesn't fit. So this rule might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves more than just the count of 1s. Maybe it's based on the number of 1s in specific columns, like odd or even columns.\n\nLet me consider the columns. For example, if a column has an odd number of 1s, the output column is all 3s. If even, it's 0 followed by 3s. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output row is determined by the sum of the input row, but that doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the output grid and see if there's a pattern based on the input rows.\n\nFor example, the first row of the output is all 3s, which corresponds to the first row of the input having four 1s.\n\nThe second row of output is 0 3 3 3, which corresponds to the second row of input having two 1s.\n\nThe third row is all 3s, which corresponds to the third row of input having one 1.\n\nThe fourth row is 3 0 3 3, which corresponds to the fourth row of input having two 1s.\n\nThe fifth row is all 3s, which corresponds to the fifth row of input having zero 1s.\n\nThe sixth row is 0 3 3 3, same as the second row of output.\n\nThe seventh row is 0 0 0 3, same as the second row of output.\n\nThe eighth row is 0 0 0 3, same as the seventh.\n\nThe ninth row is 0 0 0 3, same as seventh.\n\nThe tenth row is 0 0 2 0, which doesn't fit the previous pattern. So perhaps there's a mistake in the output grid provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is more complex, involving the positions of the 1s in the row.\n\nFor example, if the 1s are", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Looking at the examples provided, I need to see how the input values are converted to the output values.\n\nFirst, let's take a closer look at Example 1. The input grid has 1s and 0s, and the output also has 1s and 0s. I notice that some rows in the output have three 3s and one 0, others have three 1s, and some have two 3s and a 0. This suggests that the rule could involve counting something.\n\nLooking at the inputs, each row has four elements. The output for each row is four numbers, but it seems like the output is a single number repeated four times, except in some cases where it's a different number. Wait, that might not be the case. Actually, in the output, each row corresponds to a single number, repeated four times. For example, the first output row is 3,3,3,3, which is four 3s. So the output is essentially a single number repeated across all columns.\n\nWait, let me check that. In Example 1, the first output row is 3,3,3,3. The second output row is 0,3,3,3. The third is 3,3,0,0. The fourth is 3,0,3,3. So each row in the output is four copies of a specific number. That's an interesting pattern. So the output is a repetition of a single number four times.\n\nNow, the task is to determine what that number is for each corresponding input row. So for each input row, the output row is four times the output number. Therefore, the rule is to look at the input row, determine the output number, and then repeat it four times in the output row.\n\nBut how do we determine the output number for each input row? Let's look at Example 1 again. The input rows are:\n\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\n0 0 2 0\n\nAnd the output rows are:\n\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nSo for each input row, the output number is determined based on the presence or absence of certain values in the input.\n\nLooking at the first input row: 1 1 0 0. The output number is 3. Similarly, the second input row: 0 1 0 1 also outputs 3. The third input row: 0 1 0 0 outputs 3, and so on. It seems like the output number is 3 for the majority of the input rows, except perhaps for some exceptions.\n\nWait, but the second output row is 0 3 3 3. So the first element is 0, but the rest are 3. That suggests that perhaps the first element isn't always 3. Maybe there's another rule based on the first element of the input row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output number is determined by some function of the input values, like the sum, product, or count of certain patterns.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern between the input and output. For example, in the first input row, all 1s, but the output is 3. In the second input row, two 1s and two 0s, but the output is still 3. The third input row has one 1 and three 0s, but again, the output is 3. The fourth input row has one 1, one 0, and two 1s\u2014no, wait, it's 1 0 1 0, so two 1s and two 0s. The output is still 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the output number is 3 whenever there's at least one 1 in the input row, and 0 otherwise. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nLooking at the first input row: 1 1 0 0 has 1s, so output is 3. Second input row: 0 1 0 1 has 1s, output is 3. Third input row: 0 1 0 0 has 1s, output is 3. Fourth input row: 1 0 1 0 has 1s, output is 3. Fifth input row: 4 4 4 4 are numbers, but the output is 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. The fifth input row's output is 3, but the input row has 4s. So maybe the 4s don't affect the output.\n\nSimilarly, the sixth input row is 2 2 2 2, which outputs 0. So if the input row has only 2s and 4s, the output is 0. The other input rows have a mix of 1s and 0s, which output 3. The seventh input row is 0 0 2 2, which outputs 3. The eighth input row is 2 2 0 0, which outputs 3. The ninth input row is 0 0 2 2, which outputs 3. The last input row is 0 0 2 0, which outputs 3.\n\nWait, but the sixth input row has all 2s, and the output is 0. So the rule might be: if all input values are 2 or 4, output 0; otherwise, output 3. But let's test this with other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the input rows have 1s, 0s, 1s, 0s, etc., and the outputs are mostly 3s except for the fourth output row, which has 3, 3, 3, 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. Let me check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input rows have 1s, 0s, and 0s, and the outputs are mostly 3s except for the fourth row, which outputs 3,3,3,3. So perhaps my initial hypothesis is correct.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the input rows have some 2s and 0s, and the outputs are mostly 3s except for the fifth row, which is 3,3,0,3. So maybe the rule is that if there's at least one 1 in the input row (excluding 4s and 2s?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 3 if there is at least one 1 in the input row, and 0 otherwise, except when all inputs are 4s or 2s, in which case it's 0.\n\nBut in Example 1, the fifth input row is all 4s, which outputs 3. So that contradicts the rule. So perhaps the 4s don't affect the output.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the sixth input row is all 2s, and the output is 0. The seventh input row is 0 0 2 2, which outputs 3, so the 2s do affect the output.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try to think differently. Maybe the output number is determined by the presence of a 1 in the input row, and 3 otherwise, except when all elements are 2 or 4, in which case it's 0. But in Example 1, the fifth input row is all 4s, and the output is 3, which contradicts this rule.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 3 when there's at least one 1 in the input, and 0 otherwise, except when all elements are 4 or 2, which output 0. But in Example 1, the fifth input row is all 4s, but the output is 3, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 3 when there is at least one 1 in the input, and 0 otherwise, regardless of 4s or 2s. But in Example 2, the sixth input row is all 2s, which would output 0, which matches the output, and the seventh input row is all 2s and 0s, which would output 0. But in Example 3, the fifth input row is all 4s, which would output 0, but the output is 3, which contradicts.\n\nSo perhaps my initial hypothesis is incorrect. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the fifth input row is all 4s, and the output is 3. That suggests that 4s don't affect the output. So perhaps the rule is: for each input row, if there's at least one 1, output 3; else, output 0. But let's check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the sixth input row is all 2s, which output is 0. The seventh input row is 0 0 2 2, which outputs 3. So the presence of 2s affects the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of any 1 in the row determines the output, but 2s don't affect it. Because in Example 2, the seventh input row has 2s, but the output is 3. So maybe if there's a 1, output is 3, regardless of 2s.\n\nBut in Example 1, the fifth input row is all 4s, which output is 3. So 4s don't affect the output. So perhaps the rule is: if there is at least one 1 in the input row (excluding 4s), output 3; else, output 0.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the sixth input row is 1 1 1 0. So it has 1s, outputs 0, which matches the output. The seventh input row is 0 0 2 2, which has no 1s, outputs 3, which matches. The eighth input row is 2 2 0 2, which has no 1s, outputs 3, which matches. The ninth input row is 0 0 2 0, which has no 1s, outputs 3, which matches. The last input row is 0 0 2 0, which has no 1s, outputs 3, which matches. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 3, let's see. The fifth input row is 0 0 2 2, which has no 1s, so output is 3. The sixth input row is 0 0 0 2, which has no 1s, output is 3. Wait, but the output in Example 3 for the sixth row is 3,3,3,3, which is four 3s. So according to the rule, since there are no 1s, output is 3, which matches.\n\nIn Example 4, the fifth input row is 2 2 2 0, which has no 1s, so output is 3, which matches. The others have no 1s except for the first row, which has 1s. So the output is 3 for all, which matches.\n\nSo based on this, the rule is: for each input row, if there is at least one 1 in the row (excluding 4s), output 3; otherwise, output 0.\n\nLet me apply this to Example 1. The fifth input row is all 4s, so no 1s, output is 3, which matches. The sixth input row is 2 2 2 2, no 1s, output is 0, which matches. The seventh input row is 0 0 2 2, no 1s, output is 3, which matches. The eighth input row is 2 2 0 0, no 1s, output is 3, which matches. The ninth input row is 0 0 2 2, no 1s, output is 3, which matches. The last row is 0 0 2 0, no 1s, output is 3, which matches. The first four input rows have 1s, so output is 3, which matches the outputs.\n\nSo the rule is: the output number is 3 if the input row contains at least one 1 (excluding 4s), otherwise it's 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the fifth input row of Example 4: 2 2 2 0. There are no 1s, so output is 0, which matches the output row of 3 3 3 0.\n\nSimilarly, the second input row in Example 4 is 1 0 1 0. There are 1s, so output is 3, which matches.\n\nSo the rule is consistent across all examples. Now, let's apply this to a new input grid to predict the output.\n\nGiven the fifth input row of Example 4: 2 2 2 0. Since there are no 1s, output is 0.\n\nAnother example: input row is 1 0 0 0. Output is 3.\n\nInput row: 0 0 1 0. Output is 3.\n\nInput row: 1 1 1 1. Output is 3.\n\nInput row: 4 4 4 4. Output is 0.\n\nInput row: 2 2 0 2. Output is 3.\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 2. Output is 3.\n\nInput row: 0 0 2 0. Output is 3.\n\nSo, applying this rule, the output grid would be filled with 3s where the input grid has at least one 1, and 0s where all elements are 4 or 2.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the fifth input row of Example 4: 2 2 2 0. Since there are no 1s, output is 0. So the output row is 0,0,0,0.\n\nSimilarly, the sixth input row in Example 4 is 0 0 0 2, which has no 1s, output is 3, so the output row is 3,3,3,3.\n\nWait, but in Example 4's output, the first row is 3 3 3 0. So that's three 3s and one 0, which matches our rule because the input row has a 0, so output is 3, but the last element is 0, so output is 0. Wait, no, the input row is 2 2 2 0, which has no 1s, so output is 0, so the output row should be four 0s. But the example shows 3 3 3 0. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let me check Example 4's input and output again.\n\nExample 4's input:\n\n1 0 1 0\n\n1 1 0 1\n\n1 0 1 1\n\n0 1 0 1\n\n4 4 4 4\n\n2 2 0 0\n\n0 0 2 0\n\n2 2 0 0\n\n0 0 2 0\n\nOutput:\n\n3 3 3 0\n\n3 3 3 3\n\n3 3 3 3\n\n3 3 0 3\n\n3 3 3 3\n\n3 3 3 3\n\n3 3 3 3\n\n3 3 3 3\n\nWait, so the fifth input row is 2 2 2 0, which has no 1s, so output is 0. So the output row should be four 0s. But in the example, it's 3 3 3 0, which is three 3s and one 0. That suggests that perhaps the rule is slightly different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the examples.\n\nIn Example 4, the fifth input row is 2 2 2 0. The output row is 3 3 3 0. So three 3s and one 0. So according to this, perhaps the rule is that if there is at least one 1 in the input row, output is 3, and if there are no 1s, output is 0 if all elements are 2 or 4, and 3 otherwise.\n\nWait, but in the fifth input row, there are no 1s, but some elements are 2s. So according to the rule, output is 3.\n\nBut in the output, it's 3,3,3,0. So perhaps the 0 is because of some other condition. Maybe the last element is 0, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that if there is at least one 1 in the input row, output is 3; else, output is 0 if all elements are 2 or 4, and 3 otherwise. But in the fifth input row, all elements are 2 and 0, so output is 3, but in the output, it's 3,3,3,0. So the last element is 0, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's stick with the initial rule: output is 3 if there's at least one 1 in the input row, else 0. Then, in the fifth input row of Example 4, the output should be four 3s, but in the example, it's three 3s and one 0. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example or my interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s occur when there are no 1s but there are also 0s. Wait, no, in the fifth input row, all elements are 2 and 0, so no 1s. So according to the rule, output should be 3, but in the example, it's 3,3,3,0. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nWait, let's look back at Example 1. The fifth input row is all 4s, which outputs 3, which fits the rule. The sixth input row is all 2s, which outputs 0. The seventh input row is 0 0 2 2, which outputs 3, which fits. The eighth input row", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or common rules.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 5x4 grid, and the output is a 5x4 grid. The same pattern seems to apply to all examples, so I'll focus on one of them to deduce the rule.\n\nFirst, let's examine the input and output for the first example:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nHmm, the first row of input is 1 1 0 0, and the output is 3 3 3 3. Similarly, the second row of input is 0 1 0 1, and the output is 0 3 3 3. So the first few rows of input don't seem to follow an obvious pattern, but maybe it's something else.\n\nLet me look at the fourth row of input, which is 1 0 1 0, and the output is 3 0 3 3. That seems a bit different. The fifth row of input is 4 4 4 4, and the output is 3 3 3 3. So perhaps when the numbers are 4, they transform into 3.\n\nLooking at another example, Example 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nAgain, the first few rows of input don't follow an obvious pattern, but when the numbers are 4, they become 3. The last row of input has 0 0 0 2, and the output is 2 2 0 2, but wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the fifth row of input is 4 4 4 4, and the output is 3 3 3 3. So that supports the idea that 4 becomes 3.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 2 2 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nSo again, 4 in any row turns into 3 in the output.\n\nIn Example 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\nSo the last row of input is 0 0 2 0, which becomes 2 2 0 0? Wait, no, the output is 0 3 3 0, but that doesn't fit. Wait, in the output, the fourth row is 0 3 3 3. So perhaps the 4s become 3s, but the last row has 0 0 2 0, which becomes 0 3 3 0, but that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me look again. The input for Example 4 is:\n\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\nSo for the last row, input is 0 0 2 0, output is 0 3 3 3. That suggests that 2 becomes 3 in some way, but not sure. Maybe the 4s are the key here, since they seem to be turning into 3s.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern between the input and output in terms of the numbers. For example, in the first row of input, 1 1 0 0 becomes 3 3 3 3. That doesn't make sense because 1 becomes 3 and 0 becomes 3. Wait, but 1 and 0 in input become 3 in output. So perhaps 1 and 0 become 3, but that can't be because in other examples, like in the first input, 0 1 0 1 becomes 0 3 3 3, so 0 becomes 0, and 1 becomes 3.\n\nWait, perhaps when the input is 1, it becomes 3, but when it's 0, it becomes 0. But then in the fourth row of input, 1 0 1 0 becomes 3 0 3 3. So 0 in that row becomes 0, which is the same as before.\n\nBut in the fifth row of input, 4 4 4 4 becomes 3 3 3 3, so 4 becomes 3.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each cell, if the input is 1, output is 3; if the input is 0, output is 0; if the input is 4, output is 3; and if it's something else, perhaps 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the last row of input is 0 0 0 2, and the output is 2 2 0 2. But wait, in the output, the fourth row is 2 2 0 2, but according to my rule, 2 would become 0, but it's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the fifth row of Example 2 again. The input is 0 0 0 2, and the output is 2 2 0 2. Wait, so 0 in some rows becomes 0, but in others, it becomes 2. That complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is more nuanced. Maybe it's based on the sum of the digits in the input cell. For example, if the sum is greater than 2, then output is 3; otherwise, it's 0. But let's test that.\n\nIn the first example, the first row is 1 1 0 0. Sum is 2, so output is 3, which matches. The second row is 0 1 0 1, sum is 2, output is 3, but in the output, it's 0 3 3 3. Wait, that's not matching. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the maximum value in the cell. For example, if the maximum is 1, output is 3; if it's 2, output is 3; if it's 0, output is 0. But in the fifth row of Example 2, the input is 0 0 0 2, and the output is 2 2 0 2. Wait, 0 and 2 are the maximum values, so according to that rule, the output should be 3s where the maximum is 2, but in the output, it's 2 where 0 is in the input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the rule is that 1 becomes 3, 0 becomes 0, and 4 becomes 3. But then in the fifth row of Example 2, 2 becomes 2 in the output, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see if the rule is that 1 and 0 become 3, and 4 becomes 3, but other numbers remain as they are. But that doesn't fit the first example, where input is 1 1 0 0 and output is 3 3 3 3, so that works for the first row, but in the fifth row, input is 4 4 4 4, output is 3 3 3 3, so that works.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row of input is 1 1 1 0, output is 3 3 3 3, which fits. The second row of input is 0 1 0 1, output is 0 3 3 3, which fits because 1 becomes 3. The third row of input is 0 0 1 1, output is 0 0 3 3, which fits. The fourth row of input is 1 1 0 1, output is 3 3 0 3, which fits.\n\nThe fifth row of input is 4 4 4 4, output is 3 3 3 3, which fits.\n\nThe sixth row of input is 0 0 0 2, output is 2 2 0 2, which fits.\n\nThe seventh row of input is 0 2 0 0, output is 3 3 0 3, which fits.\n\nThe eighth row of input is 2 2 0 0, output is 3 3 0 3, which fits.\n\nThe ninth row of input is 0 0 2 0, output is 0 3 0 3, but according to the rule I just thought of, 0 becomes 0, 2 becomes 3, so the output should be 0 3 3 3, but the actual output is 0 3 0 3, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So my initial rule is not working for the ninth row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is based on the sum of the digits in each cell, where 1 and 0 are summed to 1 or 0, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers. For example, in the first row, 1 1 0 0 becomes 3 3 3 3, which is all 3s. In the second row of Example 2, 0 1 0 1 becomes 0 3 3 3, which has 0 in the first and third positions, and 3 in the second and fourth.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 1 and 0 become 3, but 2 becomes 2, and 4 becomes 3. So in the first example, 1 1 0 0 becomes 3 3 3 3, which fits. The second row of Example 2 is 0 1 0 1, which becomes 0 3 3 3, which fits. The fifth row of Example 2 is 0 0 0 2, which becomes 2 2 0 2, but according to the rule, 0 becomes 0, 2 becomes 2, so the output should be 0 0 0 2. But in the output, it's 2 2 0 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe the rule is more complex, perhaps it's based on the number of non-zero digits or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 1 and 0 become 3, 2 becomes 2, and 4 becomes 3. So let's test that.\n\nIn the first example, the input is 1 1 0 0, which becomes 3 3 3 3, which fits.\n\nThe second row of Example 1 is 0 1 0 1, which becomes 0 3 3 3, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row of input is 1 1 1 0, which becomes 3 3 3 3, which matches.\n\nThe second row of Example 2 is 0 1 0 1, which becomes 0 3 3 3, which matches.\n\nThe third row of Example 2 is 0 0 1 1, which becomes 0 0 3 3, which matches.\n\nThe fourth row of Example 2 is 1 1 0 1, which becomes 3 3 0 3, which matches.\n\nThe fifth row of Example 2 is 4 4 4 4, which becomes 3 3 3 3, which matches.\n\nThe sixth row of Example 2 is 0 0 0 2, which becomes 0 0 0 2, but in the output, it's 2 2 0 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. Maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that 1 and 0 become 3, and 2 becomes 2, but 4 becomes 3. So in the sixth row of Example 2, 0 0 0 2 becomes 0 0 0 2, but the output is 2 2 0 2, which suggests that 2 in the input becomes 2 in the output, which contradicts the rule.\n\nSo perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the rule is that 1 and 0 become 3, but 2 and 4 become 2. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 2, the sixth row of input is 0 0 0 2, and the output is 2 2 0 2. So 0 becomes 0, 2 becomes 2, which doesn't fit the rule because 2 should become 2. Wait, but in the output, some 2s are in the first three positions, which don't fit the rule.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 1 and 0 become 3, but 2 and 4 become 2. So in Example 2:\n\nInput row 1: 1 1 1 0 \u2192 output 3 3 3 2 (but in the output, it's 3 3 3 3), so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each cell's value is the sum of the input digits multiplied by 1, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me try to see if there's a pattern in the number of 3s in each row. For example, in the first example, the output rows have 4 rows of 3s, 1 row of 0, and 2 rows of 3s, but that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 1 and 0 become 3, but 2 and 4 become 2. So in Example 2, the sixth row of input is 0 0 0 2, which according to the rule, should become 0 0 0 2, but the output is 2 2 0 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rule. Maybe it's based on the number of non-zero digits or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 1 and 0 become 3, and 2 and 4 become 2. So in Example 2, the output rows are:\n\n3 3 3 3\n\n0 3 3 3\n\n3 3 0 3\n\n3 0 3 3\n\n2 2 0 2\n\n0 3 0 3\n\n0 3 0 3\n\n0 3 3 3\n\nBut according to the rule, the sixth row should be 0 0 0 2. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and should try to find a pattern based on the sum of the digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 1 and 0 become 3, but 2 and 4 become 2, and 3 remains 3.\n\nSo in Example 2, the sixth row of input is 0 0 0 2, which would become 0 0 0 2, but the output is 2 2 0 2, which suggests that 2 in the input becomes 2 in the output, but 0 remains 0. That doesn't fit the rule.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look at the output grid and see what's going on there. Let me see the first output grid:\n\n3 3 3 3\n\n0 3 3 3\n\n3 3 0 0\n\n3 0 3 3\n\nLooking at this, perhaps each row has a certain pattern. For example, the first row has all 3s, the second row has 0 followed by 3s, the third row has 3s except for the last two positions, which are 0, and the fourth row has 3, 0, 3, 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in each row, the first and last elements are 3, and the middle elements depend on the input.\n\nWait, for example, in the first row of input, all are 1, so in the output, all are 3. In the second row of input, there's a 0, so in the output, it's 0, but the others are 3.\n\nIn the third row of input, there's a 0 and a 2, so in the output, it's 3, 3, 0, 0.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth row of input has 1, 0, 1, 0, so the output is ", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 2\n2 2 2 0\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Alright, I have to figure out the common rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let's start by examining the examples provided to identify any patterns or rules that might apply.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 1:\n\nInput Grid:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\n\nOutput Grid:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nHmm, the input grid has a mix of 0s and 1s, and the output grid has mostly 3s with some 0s and 3s in specific positions. It seems like the output values might be derived from some calculation involving the input values.\n\nNext, looking at Example 2:\n\nInput Grid:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\n\nOutput Grid:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nAgain, the output seems to have mostly 3s, but with some variation. It's possible that the rule involves some combination of the input values, like addition, multiplication, or a bitwise operation.\n\nMoving on to Example 3:\n\nInput Grid:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\n\nOutput Grid:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nHere, the output grid has a mix of 3s and 0s, but it's not immediately obvious what the rule is. Maybe it's related to the number of 1s in each row or column.\n\nLooking at Example 4:\n\nInput Grid:\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n\nOutput Grid:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\nThe output here has a single 0 and the rest 3s. It seems like the rule might be that a 0 in the input causes the corresponding output to be 0, while 1s are converted to 3s. But I need to verify this with the other examples.\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis with Example 1. Each input has 1s and 0s. If we assume that any 0 in the input results in a 0 in the output, and 1s become 3s, then let's see:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n\nIf we replace 1s with 3s and 0s with 0s, the output would be:\n\n3 3 0 0\n0 3 0 3\n0 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nBut the actual output from Example 1 is:\n\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nThis doesn't match my hypothesis. So, the rule isn't simply replacing 1s with 3s and 0s with 0s. Maybe there's a more complex rule, like multiplying by a certain number or adding a value.\n\nLooking back at Example 1, the first row of input is 1 1 0 0. The output is 3 3 3 3. If we think of 1 as 1 and 0 as 0, but outputting 3 instead. Maybe it's 1 multiplied by 3, but then how does that apply to the entire grid?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output is the sum of the input values, but that doesn't fit because in the first row, sum of 1s is 2, which would be 6, but output is 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum modulo 4, but 2 modulo 4 is 2, which is not the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the product of the sum and some factor. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 3s and 0s. Output also has 3s and 0s. Maybe the rule is that any 0 results in 0, and 1s become 3.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has some 3s and some 0s where the input has 0s and 1s. Maybe the rule is that if an input cell is 1, the output is 3; if it's 0, output is 0. But in Example 1, the first row input is 1 1 0 0, so output should be 3 3 0 0, but in reality, it's 3 3 3 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the row or column. Let's check Example 1:\n\nFirst row: 1 1 0 0. Sum is 2. If output is 3, maybe 2+1=3.\n\nSecond row: 0 1 0 1. Sum is 2. Output is 0 3 3 3. Hmm, not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the count of 1s in each row or column. Let's check Example 1:\n\nFirst row: 1 1 0 0 \u2192 2 1s. Output is 3 3 3 3.\n\nBut the output is 3 for all cells, so maybe it's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 3 when there's at least one 1 in the input, and 0 when all are 0s. Let's see:\n\nFirst row: 1 1 0 0 \u2192 at least one 1 \u2192 output 3 3 3 3.\n\nSecond row: 0 1 0 1 \u2192 at least one 1 \u2192 output 0 3 3 3.\n\nThird row: 0 1 0 0 \u2192 at least one 1 \u2192 output 3 3 0 0.\n\nFourth row: 1 0 1 0 \u2192 at least one 1 \u2192 output 3 0 3 3.\n\nThis matches Example 1. Let's test this with Example 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n\nIf at least one 1 \u2192 output 3 for each cell, except where all are 0s.\n\nLooking at the output in Example 2:\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nWait, in the first row of output, only first and fourth cells are 0 and 3, which doesn't fit the rule. The third cell is 0, which would be 3 according to the rule, but it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is more complex. Let's think differently. Maybe it's the sum of each row in the input. Let's calculate that for Example 1:\n\nFirst row: 1+1+0+0=2 \u2192 output 3 3 3 3 (sum 2, but output is 3 for all)\nWait, 2 becomes 3. Maybe it's 2+1=3.\n\nSecond row: 0+1+0+1=2 \u2192 output 0 3 3 3 (sum 2, output starts with 0)\nHmm, inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum multiplied by 1.25. 2*1.25=2.5, rounded to 3.\n\nBut let's test with Example 2:\n\nFirst row: sum=1+1+1+0=3 \u2192 output sum=3 \u2192 0 3 0 3 \u2192 sum=0+3+0+3=6 \u2192 but output is 3 3 3 3, which is sum=12. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of 1s in each row. For Example 1:\n\nFirst row: 2 ones \u2192 output 3 3 3 3.\n\nSecond row: 2 ones \u2192 output 0 3 3 3 (only first cell is 0).\n\nThird row: 3 ones \u2192 output 3 3 0 0.\n\nFourth row: 3 ones \u2192 output 3 0 3 3.\n\nThis matches Example 1, but let's test with Example 2:\n\nFirst row: sum=3 \u2192 output 0 3 0 3 \u2192 sum=6 doesn't match output sum=12.\n\nSecond row: sum=2 \u2192 output 3 3 3 3 \u2192 sum=12? No, output sum is 12, but input is 2.\n\nSo this rule is inconsistent.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the maximum value in each row or column. Let's check Example 1:\n\nFirst row: max=1 \u2192 output 3.\n\nSecond row: max=1 \u2192 output 0 3 3 3.\n\nBut 3 vs 0, inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum modulo 4. Let's see:\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row: sum=2 \u2192 2 mod 4=2 \u2192 output 3.\n\nSecond row: sum=2 \u2192 2 mod 4=2 \u2192 output 0.\n\nBut output in Example 1 is 0 3 3 3, which doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of non-zero elements in each row. Let's try:\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row: 2 non-zero \u2192 output 3 3 3 3.\n\nSecond row: 2 non-zero \u2192 output 0 3 3 3.\n\nThird row: 3 non-zero \u2192 output 3 3 0 0.\n\nFourth row: 3 non-zero \u2192 output 3 0 3 3.\n\nThis matches Example 1.\n\nLet's test with Example 2:\n\nFirst row: sum=3 \u2192 non-zero=3 \u2192 output 3 3 3 3.\n\nSecond row: sum=2 \u2192 non-zero=2 \u2192 output 3 3 3 3.\n\nThird row: sum=3 \u2192 output 3 3 3 3.\n\nFourth row: sum=2 \u2192 output 3 3 3 3.\n\nBut the output in Example 2 is:\n\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nThis doesn't match. In the first row, the output should be 3 3 3 3 according to the rule, but it's 0 3 0 3. So this rule isn't consistent.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is more involved, like the sum of the input row multiplied by 1.25, but that would be 2*1.25=2.5\u21923, which fits for the first row.\n\nLet's test this with the second row in Example 2:\n\nSum=2 \u2192 2*1.25=2.5\u21923. But output is 3,3,3,3, which sum to 12, while 2*1.25=2.5. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum plus 1. Let's see:\n\nFirst row: sum=2 \u2192 2+1=3.\n\nSecond row: sum=2 \u2192 2+1=3, but output starts with 0. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the number of 1s multiplied by 1.5, but 2*1.5=3, which fits.\n\nBut checking with the second row in Example 2:\n\nSum=2 \u2192 2*1.5=3, but output is 3,3,3,3. So it matches.\n\nLet's test this with the third row in Example 2:\n\nSum=3 \u2192 3*1.5=4.5 \u2192 rounded to 5? But output is 3,3,3,3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of 1s multiplied by (4/3), which would be about 2.666. But not an integer.\n\nThis approach is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking back at Example 1, the output grid has 3s in certain positions where the input has 1s, but not all. Wait, in the first row of input, all are 0s except for two 1s, which are replaced by all 3s. In the second row, two 1s are replaced by 0 and two 3s. So perhaps it's the count of 1s in each row, but if the count is even, output is 3s; if odd, 0s.\n\nWait, let's test this:\n\nFirst row: 2 1s \u2192 even \u2192 output 3s.\n\nSecond row: 2 1s \u2192 even \u2192 but output is 0 and two 3s, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the count of 1s modulo 2. If even, output 3s; if odd, 0s. But in Example 1, all rows have even counts of 1s, so output all 3s, which fits. Let's check Example 2:\n\nFirst row: 3 1s \u2192 odd \u2192 output 0.\n\nSecond row: 2 1s \u2192 even \u2192 output 3s.\n\nThird row: 3 1s \u2192 odd \u2192 output 0.\n\nFourth row: 2 1s \u2192 even \u2192 output 3s.\n\nWait, but the output in Example 2 is:\n\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nThis doesn't match. The first row should be 0, 3, 0, 3 according to my rule, but according to the actual output, it's 0, 3, 0, 3. Wait, that matches. The second row is 3,3,3,3, which matches. Third row is 3,3,3,3, which matches. Fourth row is 3,3,0,3, which matches. So my rule works for Example 2.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output is 3,3,3,3 for all rows, which fits my rule because all rows have even counts of 1s.\n\nWait, but in Example 3:\n\nLet's check the first row of input: 1 1 0 0 \u2192 2 1s. Even \u2192 output 3 3 0 0.\n\nSecond row: 1 0 1 0 \u2192 2 1s \u2192 output 3 3 0 0.\n\nThird row: 1 1 0 1 \u2192 3 1s \u2192 odd \u2192 output 0 0 2 2.\n\nWait, but according to my rule, it should be 0 3 0 0. But the actual output is 3 3 0 3.\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit. So my rule is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is different. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 3, the output is:\n\n3 3 0 3\n\n3 3 0 3\n\n3 3 0 3\n\n3 3 3 3\n\nLet's look at the input rows:\n\nFirst row: 1 1 0 0 \u2192 2 1s \u2192 output 3 3 0 3.\n\nSecond row: 1 0 1 0 \u2192 2 1s \u2192 output 3 3 0 3.\n\nThird row: 1 1 0 1 \u2192 3 1s \u2192 output 3 3 0 3.\n\nFourth row: 1 1 1 1 \u2192 4 1s \u2192 output 3 3 3 3.\n\nWait, but the fourth row's output is 3 3 3 3, which suggests that when all are 1s, it remains 3s. So perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each cell, if all inputs in a row or column are 1, then the output is 3s.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, each row has at least two 1s, so the output is 3s.\n\nIn Example 2, the fourth row has 2 1s, so the output is 3s.\n\nIn Example 3, the fourth row has all 1s, so output is 3s.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the fourth row's input is 1 1 1 1, but the output is 3 3 3 3, which fits. Let's check other rows.\n\nFirst row of input: 1 1 0 0 \u2192 at least two 1s, so output is 3s, but in the output, it's 3 3 0 3. So, first and second cells are 3, third is 0, fourth is 3.\n\nThis doesn't fit the rule where all cells should be 3s. So, perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the row or column, but with a twist.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the count of 1s in each row or column, but if the count is even, output is 3s; if odd, 0s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has all 1s, which is even (4), so output is 3s, which fits.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nFirst row: 2 1s \u2192 even \u2192", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

The examples given are a bit complex, so I'll need to take each step carefully. Let me start by looking at the first example to understand the pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has a mix of 0s and 1s, and the output grid has corresponding numbers, mostly 0s and 3s. The goal is to figure out what rule transforms the input into the output. Let me list out the input and output pairs to see any patterns.\n\nInput Grid:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput Grid:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nLooking at the first row of the input, it's [1,1,0,0]. The output is [3,3,3,3]. Hmm, that's interesting. So, a row of two 1s and two 0s seems to result in all 3s. Maybe the rule involves some calculation based on the number of 1s or 0s in the row.\n\nLet me check the second row of the input: [0,1,0,1]. The output is [0,3,3,3]. So, a row with two 1s and two 0s ends with 0 in the output. Wait, that's the same as the first row. So, maybe the number of 1s determines something. If there are two 1s, the output is all 3s except for the last element, which is 0. But how does that fit with other rows?\n\nLooking at another row, say [0,1,0,0]. Output is [3,0,3,3]. So, it's 3, then 0, then two 3s. That doesn't fit the pattern of all 3s except the last element. Maybe it's not just based on the count of 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the sum of the numbers in the row. Let me see:\n\nFirst row sum: 1+1+0+0 = 2 \u2192 output is 3.\nSecond row sum: 0+1+0+1 = 2 \u2192 output is 0.\nThird row sum: 0+1+0+0 = 1 \u2192 output is 3.\nFourth row sum: 1+0+1+0 = 2 \u2192 output is 3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match because the second row's sum is 2, but the output is 0. So, maybe it's not the sum. Maybe it's something else.\n\nAnother approach could be considering each element individually. Let's see if each input element relates to the output element in a specific way. For example, maybe the output is the sum of the input numbers multiplied by some factor, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, let me think about the output values. The outputs are mostly 0s and 3s. Maybe it's a combination of two different values, and the rule determines which one to use. For example, if the input has an odd number of 1s, perhaps it results in 3, and even number results in 0. But in the first row, the sum is 2 (even), output is 3. In the second row, sum is 2 (even), output is 0. That doesn't align. So, maybe it's not based on the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the parity of the count in a specific way. Maybe it's the count modulo something. For example, if the count of 1s is congruent to 1 modulo 2, it gives 3, else 0. Let me check:\n\nFirst row: 2 ones \u2192 2 mod 2 = 0 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\nSecond row: 2 ones \u2192 same as above.\nThird row: 1 one \u2192 1 mod 2 = 1 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\nFourth row: 2 ones \u2192 same as first.\n\nSo, that theory doesn't hold.\n\nWait, maybe it's the majority. If there's more 1s, output is 3, else 0. First row has two, output is 3. Second row also has two, output is 0. Third row has one, output is 3. Fourth row has two, output is 3. That doesn't fit because the second row's output is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the average. For the first row, the average is 0.5, which doesn't match 3. So, probably not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the presence of certain features in the input. For example, each output element is determined by whether a certain condition is met in the corresponding row of the input.\n\nLooking at the first row: [1,1,0,0] \u2192 output [3,3,3,3]. So, all elements are 3. Maybe this is because there are two 1s and two 0s, so a certain condition is met.\n\nIn the second row, [0,1,0,1] \u2192 output [0,3,3,3]. So, the first element is 0, others are 3. Maybe it's because there are two 1s, but the first element is 0. So, perhaps the output is determined by the position of the 1s and 0s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element depends on the presence of 1s in a specific column. For example, if a column has an odd number of 1s, the output element in that column is 3; else, it's 0. Let me check:\n\nFirst row:\nColumns: 1,1,0,0 \u2192 two 1s. So, output first column is 3.\nSecond row: 0,1,0,1 \u2192 two 1s. So, output first column is 3? But in the output, the first element is 0. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the row. First row sum is 2, output is 3. Second row sum is 2, output is 0. Third row sum is 1, output is 3. Fourth row sum is 2, output is 3. That doesn't fit because the second row's sum is 2, but output is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the maximum value in the row. First row has 1s, output is 3. Second row also has 1s, but output is 0. Third row has 0s, output is 3. Fourth row also has 0s, output is 3. That doesn't fit because the second row's output is 0, but the maximum is 1.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each output element is determined by a specific function of the input elements in its row. For example, if a certain condition involving the input elements is met, output is 3; else, 0.\n\nLooking at the first row: [1,1,0,0]. Output is [3,3,3,3]. So, all 3s. Maybe in this row, the presence of 1s in certain columns results in 3, others 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is based on whether the row contains an even or odd number of 1s. Let me check:\n\nFirst row: 2 ones \u2192 even \u2192 output is 3.\nSecond row: 2 ones \u2192 even \u2192 output is 0.\nThird row: 1 one \u2192 odd \u2192 output is 3.\nFourth row: 2 ones \u2192 even \u2192 output is 3.\n\nThis doesn't fit because the second row's output is 0, but the first and fourth have even counts, output is 3; third has odd count, output is 3. So, no, that theory doesn't hold.\n\nWait, maybe it's the opposite. If even, output is 0; if odd, output is 3.\n\nFirst row: even \u2192 0 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\nSecond row: even \u2192 0 \u2192 output is 0. Fits.\nThird row: odd \u2192 3 \u2192 output is 3. Fits.\nFourth row: even \u2192 0 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo, only the second and third rows fit this theory. Not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the presence of a certain pattern. For example, if a pair of 1s is present, output is 3; otherwise, 0.\n\nFirst row: has two 1s \u2192 output is 3.\nSecond row: has two 1s \u2192 output is 0. Doesn't fit.\nThird row: has one 1 \u2192 output is 3.\nFourth row: has two 1s \u2192 output is 3.\n\nOnly the first and third rows fit, but the second doesn't. So, not the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is based on the diagonal of the input grid. Let me see.\n\nFirst row: [1,1,0,0] \u2192 output [3,3,3,3]\nSecond row: [0,1,0,1] \u2192 output [0,3,3,3]\nThird row: [0,1,0,0] \u2192 output [3,3,0,0]\nFourth row: [1,0,1,0] \u2192 output [3,0,3,3]\n\nLooking at the diagonals:\n\nFirst row's diagonal is [1,1,0,0] \u2192 output is [3,3,3,3]\nSecond row's diagonal is [0,1,0,1] \u2192 output is [0,3,3,3]\nThird row's diagonal is [0,1,0,0] \u2192 output is [3,3,0,0]\nFourth row's diagonal is [1,0,1,0] \u2192 output is [3,0,3,3]\n\nThis doesn't seem to be a direct pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is determined by the minimum value in the row. First row has 1s, output is 3. Second row has 1s, but output is 0. Third row has 0s, output is 3. Fourth row has 0s, output is 3. So, no, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the maximum value. First row has 1s, output is 3. Second row has 1s, output is 0. Third row has 0s, output is 3. Fourth row has 0s, output is 3. So, the maximum doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on whether the row has at least one 1. First row has 1s \u2192 output is 3. Second row has 1s \u2192 output is 0. Third row has 1s \u2192 output is 3. Fourth row has 1s \u2192 output is 3. So, only the first and third rows have 1s, leading to output 3, but the second row has 1s as well, leading to 0. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum modulo 3. First row sum is 2 \u2192 2 mod 3 is 2, output is 3. Second row sum is 2 \u2192 2 mod 3 is 2, output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum multiplied by some factor. First row sum 2 \u2192 2*1.5=3. Second row sum 2 \u2192 2*1.5=3, but output is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the input elements multiplied by the number of 1s in each row. Let me check:\n\nFirst row: sum 2, 1s 2 \u2192 2*2=4 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\nSecond row: sum 2, 1s 2 \u2192 2*2=4 \u2192 output is 0. Doesn't fit.\nThird row: sum 1, 1s 1 \u2192 1*1=1 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\nFourth row: sum 2, 1s 2 \u2192 2*2=4 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nNo, that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe each output element is determined by the presence of a 1 in a specific column. For example, if the first column has a 1, output is 3; else, 0. Let me check:\n\nFirst row: [1,1,0,0] \u2192 first column is 1 \u2192 output 3, others as 3. Fits.\nSecond row: [0,1,0,1] \u2192 first column is 0 \u2192 output 0, others as 3. Fits.\nThird row: [0,1,0,0] \u2192 first column is 0 \u2192 output 0, others as 3. But the output is [3,3,0,0], so it's 3,3,0,0. So, first two are 3, others 0. Doesn't fit.\nFourth row: [1,0,1,0] \u2192 first column is 1 \u2192 output 3, others as 3. But output is [3,0,3,3], so first is 3, others 0,3,3. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo, first and fourth rows fit, but third and second don't. Not the rule.\n\nWait, maybe each output element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the row. Let's see:\n\nFirst row: [1,1,0,0] \u2192 sum is 2 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\nSecond row: [0,1,0,1] \u2192 sum is 2 \u2192 output is 0. Doesn't fit.\nThird row: [0,1,0,0] \u2192 sum is 1 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\nFourth row: [1,0,1,0] \u2192 sum is 2 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nNo, that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is determined by the parity of the number of 1s in each row. Let's check:\n\nFirst row: 2 ones \u2192 even \u2192 output is 3.\nSecond row: 2 ones \u2192 even \u2192 output is 0.\nThird row: 1 one \u2192 odd \u2192 output is 3.\nFourth row: 2 ones \u2192 even \u2192 output is 3.\n\nThis fits the first and third rows, but not the second and fourth. So, it's not the rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the row multiplied by the number of 1s. Let me see:\n\nFirst row: sum 2, 1s 2 \u2192 2*2=4 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\nSecond row: sum 2, 1s 2 \u2192 2*2=4 \u2192 output is 0. Doesn't fit.\nThird row: sum 1, 1s 1 \u2192 1*1=1 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\nFourth row: sum 2, 1s 2 \u2192 2*2=4 \u2192 output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nNo, that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe each output element is determined by a specific pattern of the input elements. For example, if any two 1s are present, output is 3; else, 0. Let's check:\n\nFirst row: two 1s \u2192 output 3. Fits.\nSecond row: two 1s \u2192 output 0. Doesn't fit.\nThird row: one 1 \u2192 output 3. Fits.\nFourth row: two 1s \u2192 output 3. Fits.\n\nSo, only the second row doesn't fit. Maybe it's a special case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the sum modulo 3. First row sum 2 \u2192 2 mod 3 is 2 \u2192 output 3. Second row sum 2 \u2192 2 mod 3 is 2 \u2192 output 0. Doesn't fit. So, that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is based on the presence of a certain number of 0s or 1s in specific positions. For example, if a 1 is in the first column, output is 3; else, 0. Let's check:\n\nFirst row: [1,1,0,0] \u2192 first column is 1 \u2192 output 3. Fits.\nSecond row: [0,1,0,1] \u2192 first column is 0 \u2192 output 0. Fits.\nThird row: [0,1,0,0] \u2192 first column is 0 \u2192 output 0. Fits.\nFourth row: [1,0,1,0] \u2192 first column is 1 \u2192 output 3. Fits.\n\nWait, that fits all rows. Let me check:\n\nFirst row: [1,1,0,0] \u2192 first column is 1 \u2192 output 3, others as 3. Fits.\nSecond row: [0,1,0,1] \u2192 first column 0 \u2192 output 0, others as 3. Fits.\nThird row: [0,1,0,0] \u2192 first column 0 \u2192 output 0, others as 3. Fits.\nFourth row: [1,0,1,0] \u2192 first column 1 \u2192 output 3, others as 3. Fits.\n\nSo, this pattern works for all rows. Now, let me see if this applies to the other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, let's see:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n\nAccording to the pattern, the output is determined by the first column. If the first column is 1, output 3; else, 0. Then, for the remaining elements, perhaps they are all 3.\n\nSo, let's apply this:\n\nFirst row: [1,1,1,0] \u2192 first column 1 \u2192 output 3, others 3 \u2192 [3,3,3,0]. But according to the example, output is [3,3,3,3]. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the second row:\n\nSecond row: [0,1,0,1] \u2192 first column 0 \u2192 output 0, others 3 \u2192 [0,3,3,3]. That fits the example's second row.\n\nThird row", 0.0], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or rules that consistently apply. Each example has an input grid and an output grid, and I need to figure out what operation takes the input to the output.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nLooking at each row of the input and its corresponding output:\n\n1. The first row in input is [1,1,0,0]. The output is [3,3,3,3].\n2. The second row is [0,1,0,1], output is [0,3,3,3].\n3. Third row: [0,1,0,0], output [3,3,0,0].\n4. Fourth row: [1,0,1,0], output [3,0,3,3].\n\nHmm, so each output row seems to have three 3s and one 0, but the position varies. It's not immediately obvious what's happening row by row.\n\nLet me check Example 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nAgain, each row has a mix of 3s and 0s. Maybe the rule involves some kind of parity or counting.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nThis one has varying 3s and 0s, again following a specific pattern.\n\nFinally, Example 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 2 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\nAgain, the output rows have 4 elements, mostly 3s except for different positions.\n\nNow, I'm thinking that the rule might involve counting the number of 1s or 0s in a row and then applying a function. For example, if a row has an even number of 1s, maybe it maps to 3, and if odd, it maps to 0. But looking at Example 1, the first row has two 1s, which is even, and the output is all 3s. That fits. The second row has one 1, which is odd, and the output has a 0 in the first position. Wait, but in the output, the second row is [0,3,3,3]. So maybe it's not just about the count.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first output row is all 3s, which corresponds to the input row [1,1,0,0]. The second output row [0,3,3,3] has a 0 in the first position. Let me see: maybe the rule is that for each element in the output row, it's 3 if the corresponding input row has at least one 1, and 0 otherwise. Let's test this.\n\nTake the first output row: [3,3,3,3]. Each input row in Example 1 has at least one 1, so this fits. The second row output is [0,3,3,3], which means that the first input row has a 0, so it's 0. The third row output is [3,3,0,0], so the first input row has a 1, so it's 3. This seems to fit.\n\nAnother example: in Example 2, the first output row is [3,3,3,3], which corresponds to the first input row [1,1,1,0], which has 3s. The second output row is [0,3,0,3], which means the first input row [0,1,0,1] has a 0, so 0, and the fourth element is 3, which is because the fourth element in the input is 1, so 3. This fits.\n\nAnother test: in Example 3, the first output row is [3,3,0,3], which corresponds to the first input row [1,1,0,0], which has at least one 1, so 3. The second output row is [3,0,3,0], which corresponds to the second input row [1,0,1,0], which has at least one 1, so 3, but the fourth element is 0, which is because the fourth element in the input is 0. Wait, but in the input, the fourth element is 0, so maybe the rule is that for each output position, it's 3 if the corresponding input row has at least one 1, and 0 otherwise.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the first output row is all 3s because the input row has 1s. The second output row has 0 in the first position because the first input row has a 0.\n\nThis seems consistent across all examples. So the rule is: for each output element, if the corresponding input row has at least one 1, output 3; otherwise, output 0.\n\nLet me test this with Example 4:\n\nInput rows:\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n\nCorresponding output rows:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\nNow, applying the rule:\n\nFirst input row [1,0,1,0] has 1s, so output is 3,3,3,0. That matches.\n\nSecond input row [1,0,1,0] same as first, so output is 3,3,3,3.\n\nThird input row [0,1,0,0] has 1, so output is 3,3,3,3.\n\nFourth input row [1,0,1,0] same as first, so output is 3,3,3,0.\n\nThis fits Example 4 perfectly.\n\nAnother test with Example 3:\n\nFirst input row [1,1,0,0] has 1s, so output is 3,3,0,3.\n\nSecond row [1,0,1,0] has 1s, so output is 3,0,3,0.\n\nThird row [1,1,0,1] has 1s, so output is 3,3,0,3.\n\nFourth row [1,1,1,1] has 1s, so output is 3,3,3,3.\n\nThis matches the output given in Example 3.\n\nSo the rule seems to be that for each output row, the corresponding position is 3 if the input row has at least one 1, and 0 otherwise.\n\nTherefore, to apply this rule to any input grid, I need to go through each input row and check if there's at least one 1. If yes, set the corresponding output row to all 3s. If no, set it to all 0s.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the provided input grid:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 2\n2 0 2 0\n\nThe output grid should be determined by checking each input row:\n\n1. [1,0,1,0]: has 1s \u2192 [3,3,3,3]\n2. [1,0,1,0]: same \u2192 [3,3,3,3]\n3. [0,1,0,0]: has 1s \u2192 [3,3,3,3]\n4. [1,0,1,0]: same \u2192 [3,3,3,3]\n5. [4,4,4,4]: no 1s \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n6. [2,2,0,0]: no 1s \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n7. [0,0,2,0]: has 1s (from third element) \u2192 [3,3,3,3]\n8. [0,2,0,2]: no 1s \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n9. [2,0,2,0]: no 1s \u2192 [0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, no, in Example 3, the fourth row input is [0,2,0,2], which has no 1s, so output is [0,0,0,0].

Let's start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a mix of 0s and 1s, and the output grid has mostly 3s and 0s. The input grid is 8x4, and the output is also 8x4. For instance, the first row of the input is all 1s, and the corresponding output row has all 3s. Similarly, when the input has 1s and 0s in certain positions, the output uses 3s and 0s as well.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that the output grid's values are related to the number of 1s in each row of the input. For example, in the first output row, all four entries are 3, which might correspond to the number of 1s in each input row. Let me check that.\n\nIn the input of Example 1, the first row is [1,1,0,0], which has two 1s. The output row is [3,3,3,3]. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Maybe it's the sum of the adjacent cells or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps each output cell is determined by the number of 1s in some specific pattern in the input. Let me think differently. Maybe each output cell is 3 if the corresponding input cell is 1, and 0 otherwise. But that doesn't fit because in the first row, all input cells are 1, so all output cells would be 3, which matches the first output row. However, in the second input row, which has 1s and 0s, the output row has some 0s and 3s, so it's not just a direct mapping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on some transformation of the input rows. For example, the sum of the input cells modulo 4 or something like that. Let's see: in the first input row, the sum is 2, and the output is 3. 2 modulo 4 is 2, which doesn't match. Maybe the sum multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe each output cell is determined by the sum of the input cells in a specific column or row. For instance, in the first output row, all four cells are 3, which might be because each input row has a certain number of 1s, and their sum is 2 (since each row in the input has two 1s). But 2 might not directly relate to 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is 3 if the input cell is 1, and 0 otherwise, but that doesn't fit because in Example 1, the second input row has 1s and 0s, and the output row has 0s in some places, which would correspond to the input 1s. So maybe that's the case.\n\nWait, let's check the first example again. The input has 1s and 0s, and the output has 3s and 0s. If I map 1 to 3 and 0 to 0, then the output grid would match. Let me verify with another row. For example, the second input row in Example 1 is [0,1,0,1], which has two 1s. The output row is [0,3,3,3]. So the first 0 maps to 0, and the two 1s map to 3, which matches the output. So it seems like the rule is: in the output grid, replace 1 with 3 and 0 with 0.\n\nWait, but in the first example, all the 1s in the input become 3 in the output, and 0s become 0. That seems to be consistent across all the rows. Let me check Example 2 to see if this holds.\n\nIn Example 2, the first output row is [3,3,3,3], which corresponds to the input row [1,1,1,0]. The other output rows have 0s and 3s based on the input rows. If I apply the same rule, replacing 1s with 3s and 0s with 0s, it matches the output. So it seems like the rule is consistent across all examples.\n\nAnother example, Example 3, the first output row is [3,3,0,3], which corresponds to the input row [1,1,0,0]. So the 1s become 3s, and the 0s become 0s, except the third cell, which is 0 in the output, but in the input it was 0, so it maps to 0. That matches the rule.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 4, the first output row is [3,3,3,0], which corresponds to the input row [1,0,1,0]. The 1s become 3s, and the 0s become 0s, so it matches.\n\nSo, after considering these examples, the rule seems to be: in the output grid, each cell is 3 if the corresponding input cell is 1, and 0 if it's 0. So the transformation is a direct mapping from 0 and 1 in the input to 0 and 3 in the output.\n</think>", -0.25], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I see that the input and output grids are both 4x4, so each cell in the input corresponds to one in the output. \n\nLooking at the first example, let's compare the input and output rows. For instance, the first row of input is 1,1,0,0 and the first row of output is 3,3,3,3. Hmm, that's interesting. So, it's not just a simple multiplication or addition because 1 times 3 isn't 3 in a straightforward way. Maybe it's a bitwise operation? Let's think about binary.\n\nWait, 1 in binary is four bits: 0001. If I do a bitwise OR with itself, it remains 0001, which is 1. But the output row is 3,3,3,3, which in binary is 0011. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's a multiplication by 3, but that seems too high.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe each bit in the input is contributing to the output based on some rule. For example, if a bit is 1, it might set the corresponding output bit to 3. But looking at the first row, input 1,1,0,0 becomes output 3,3,3,3. That suggests that each 1 in the input turns into 3 in the output. But wait, the second row of input is 0,1,0,1, which would become 0,3,0,3 as per the output. That fits. Similarly, the third row of input is 0,1,0,0, which becomes 0,3,0,3. The fourth row is 1,0,1,0, which becomes 3,0,3,3. That seems consistent. \n\nSo, the rule is that any 1 in the input becomes 3, and 0s remain 0. But wait, looking at the second example, the first row input is 1,1,1,0. Output is 3,3,3,3. That fits. The second input row is 0,1,0,1, output 0,3,3,3. That also fits. So, yes, the rule is to replace every 1 with 3 and 0 with 0 in each cell.\n\nLet me double-check with another example. In example 3, the first input row is 1,1,0,0, output is 3,3,0,3. That matches. The second input row is 1,0,1,0, output is 3,0,3,0. Wait, no, the output is 3,0,3,0, but according to the rule, the second input row should be 1,0,1,0, so output should be 3,0,3,0. But in the example given, the output is 3,0,3,0? Wait, no, let me check the example again.\n\nWait, in example 3, the output for the first row is 3,3,0,3. So, the third cell is 0, but according to the rule, it should be 0. Wait, no, the input is 1,0,1,0, which according to the rule should be 3,0,3,0. But in the example, the second row input is 1,0,1,0, and the output is 3,0,3,0. That matches. The third input row is 1,1,0,1, which becomes 3,3,0,3. That matches the example output. The fourth input row is 1,1,1,1, which becomes 3,3,3,3. That's correct. The fifth input row is 4,4,4,4, which becomes 0,0,0,0. That's correct. The sixth input row is 2,2,0,2, which becomes 0,0,0,0. Correct. The seventh input row is 0,0,2,0, which becomes 0,0,0,0. Correct. The eighth input row is 0,2,0,0, which becomes 0,0,0,0. Correct. The ninth input row is 2,0,2,0, which becomes 0,0,0,0. Correct. The tenth input row is 0,2,0,2, which becomes 0,0,0,0. Wait, the output given is 0,0,0,0. Wait, no, the output in example 3 is 3 3 0 3, then 0 3 0 3, 3 3 3 3, 3 3 0 3. Hmm, so the second row input is 1,0,1,0, which gives 3,0,3,0. The third row input is 1,1,0,1, which gives 3,3,0,3. The fourth row input is 1,1,1,1, which gives 3,3,3,3. The fifth row input is 4,4,4,4, which gives 0,0,0,0. The sixth row input is 2,2,0,2, which gives 0,0,0,0. The seventh row input is 0,0,2,0, which gives 0,0,0,0. The eighth row input is 0,2,0,0, which gives 0,0,0,0. The ninth row input is 2,0,2,0, which gives 0,0,0,0. The tenth row input is 0,2,0,2, which gives 0,0,0,0.

Let me look at each row of the input and see how they translate to the output.\n\nLooking at the first row of the input: 1 1 0 0. The output row is 3 3 3 3. So all the 1s become 3s, and 0s are somehow turned into 3s as well. Wait, but the output is all 3s. So maybe the rule is to count something and assign it to 3.\n\nLooking at the second row of input: 0 1 0 1. Output: 0 3 3 3. So the 0 becomes 0, and the 1s become 3s. That makes sense. So perhaps it's about counting the number of 1s in a row and assigning a certain value based on that.\n\nLet me check another row. Third row of input: 0 1 0 0. Output: 3 3 0 0. So here, there's one 1, and the output row has two 3s followed by two 0s. That doesn't fit the previous pattern. Hmm, maybe it's not just the number of 1s.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe it's the sum of the digits? Let's see.\n\nIn the first row: 1+1+0+0 = 2, which doesn't match the output of 3. Maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the count of 1s, and each 1 becomes 3, but then some 0s are converted as well. Wait, in the first row, all 1s become 3s, so maybe 1s become 3s, and 0s become something else, maybe 0 or a 3. But in the second row, 0 becomes 0, which is the same as the input.\n\nWait, in the second row, the output has 0, 3, 3, 3, so maybe when the input has a 0, it's converted to 0 in the output, and 1s become 3s. Let me test this with other rows.\n\nThird row: Input is 0 1 0 0. Output is 3 3 0 0. So the 0s become 0, 1 becomes 3, so that fits. Fourth row of input: 1 0 1 0. Output: 3 3 3 3. So 1s become 3, and 0 becomes 3? Wait, no, in the second row, 0 becomes 0. So perhaps only 1s become 3, and 0s become 0. But in the third row, the 0s are still 0, and 1s are 3. In the fourth row, all are 1s, so they become 3s. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the second example to see if this holds.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nHmm, let's see. First row: input 1 1 1 0 becomes output 3 3 3 3. So 1s become 3s, 0 remains 3? Wait, no, because in the second row, 0 becomes 0, and 1s become 3. Third row, 0s become 0, 1s become 3. Fourth row, input 1 1 0 1 becomes output 3 3 3 3. So it's consistent.\n\nWait, but in the fourth row of input, input is 1 1 0 1, which has two 1s and one 0. Output is all 3s. So perhaps whenever there's a 1, it becomes 3, and 0 remains 0. But in the second example, the second row is 0 1 0 1, output is 0 3 0 3. So 0s become 0, 1s become 3. That fits.\n\nBut wait, in the first row of example 2, input is 1 1 1 0, output is 3 3 3 3. So 0 becomes 3? But in the second example, second row is 0 1 0 1, output is 0 3 0 3, so 0 becomes 0. Hmm, this inconsistency suggests my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the second example:\n\nSecond Input row: 0 1 0 1. Output: 0 3 0 3. So 0s become 0, and 1s become 3. But in the first row of example 2, input is 1 1 1 0, output is 3 3 3 3. So 1s become 3, 0s remain 3. So in this case, 0s become 3. That contradicts the second row.\n\nHmm, maybe the 0s become 0, and 1s become 3. But in the first row of example 2, input is 1 1 1 0, output is 3 3 3 3. So 1s become 3, 0s become 3? But in the second row, 0 becomes 0.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLooking at the third example:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nHmm, the output seems to have mostly 3s, but some 0s. Let's see.\n\nFirst row of output: 3 3 0 3. So 1s to 3, 0s to 3, but one 0 becomes 0. That suggests that 1s become 3, 0s become 0.\n\nSecond row: 3 0 3 0. Again, 1s to 3, 0s to 0.\n\nThird row: 3 3 0 3. Same as first.\n\nFourth row: 3 3 3 3. So all 3s.\n\nSimilarly, in the other rows, mostly 3s, but some zeros.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output had mostly 3s and one 0. So perhaps the rule is to count the number of 1s in a row, and if it's odd, assign 3; if even, assign 0. Let's check.\n\nFirst row of input in Example 1: 1 1 0 0. Number of 1s is 2, which is even. Output is 3 3 3 3. Wait, no, output is 3s, which doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the digits multiplied by 1.5, but that might not be integer. Let me see.\n\nIn the first row of Example 1, sum is 2. 2 * 1.5 = 3. So 3. That fits.\n\nSecond row of input: 0 1 0 1. Sum is 2, so 3.\n\nThird row: 0 1 0 0. Sum is 1, 1 * 1.5 = 1.5, but output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the count of non-zero digits. Let's see.\n\nFirst row: 1 1 0 0. Two 1s, output is 3 3 3 3. So each 1 becomes 3, others 0s also become 3s. That fits.\n\nSecond row: 0 1 0 1. Two 1s, output is 0 3 0 3. So 1s become 3, 0s remain 0. That fits.\n\nThird row: 0 1 0 0. One 1, output is 3 3 0 0. So 1 becomes 3, 0s remain 0. That fits.\n\nFourth row: 1 0 1 0. Two 1s, output is 3 3 3 3. So 1s become 3, 0s remain 0. That fits.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the first row's output is all 3s. So that fits. The second row's output is 0 3 0 3. So 1s become 3, 0s remain 0. The third row's output is 3 3 0 0. So 1 becomes 3, 0 remains 0. The fourth row's output is 3 0 3 3. So one 1 becomes 3, two 0s become 0, and one 1 becomes 3. Wait, that contradicts the previous pattern.\n\nWait, in the fourth row of input: 1 0 1 0. The output is 3 0 3 3. So two 1s become 3, one 0 becomes 0, one 1 becomes 3. So that doesn't fit the previous pattern where 0s remain 0.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different. Let me try to see.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the fourth row has three 3s and one 0. So maybe it's considering something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the digits with some transformation. Let me check.\n\nFirst row: sum is 2, output is 3. So maybe 2 becomes 3, which is 2+1.\n\nSecond row: sum is 2, output is 3. So same as before.\n\nThird row: sum is 1, output is 3. So 1+2=3.\n\nFourth row: sum is 2, output is 3. So again 2+1=3.\n\nWait, so maybe the rule is to sum the digits and add 1. That would explain:\n\nFirst row: 2+1=3.\n\nSecond row: 2+1=3.\n\nThird row: 1+2=3.\n\nFourth row: 2+1=3.\n\nBut in the fourth row, the output is 3 0 3 3, which has three 3s and one 0. So perhaps the 1 becomes 3, the 0 remains 0, but the other 1 becomes 3. So maybe the rule is that each 1 becomes 3, and 0 remains 0.\n\nBut then in the fourth row of Example 1, the sum is 2, so 3. But the output has three 3s and one 0, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each 1 becomes 3, and 0 becomes 0. So regardless of the sum, 1s become 3, 0s remain 0.\n\nBut in the fourth row, the sum is 2, so 3, but the output has three 3s and one 0. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps in Example 1, the output is not always the maximum possible. Maybe it's a fixed rule, like if there's at least one 1, output is 3, else 0. But in the second row, the input has two 1s, so output is 3, but the second input row is 0 1 0 1, which has two 1s, so output is 3, but wait, the output is 0 3 0 3. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Maybe the rule is based on the presence of 1s. If there are any 1s, output is 3, else 0. That would fit the first row, second row, third row, and fourth row of Example 1.\n\nWait, but in the fourth row of Example 1, the input has two 1s, so according to this rule, the output should be all 3s, but the actual output is 3 0 3 3, which has a 0. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that if the sum of the digits is even, output is 0; if odd, output is 3. Let's test:\n\nFirst row: sum is 2 (even), output is 3. So no, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum multiplied by 1.5. First row sum 2, 2*1.5=3. Second row sum 2: 2*1.5=3. Third row sum 1: 1*1.5=1.5, but output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's based on the number of 1s modulo 2. So if the number of 1s is odd, output is 3; else 0.\n\nFirst row: 2 1s (even), output 0. But first row output is 3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of 1s is odd, output is 3; else 0. But first row has 2 1s, which is even, output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to count the number of 1s and assign 3 if there are at least two 1s, else 0. Let's see.\n\nFirst row: 2 1s, output 3.\n\nSecond row: 2 1s, output 3.\n\nThird row: 1 1, output 3.\n\nFourth row: 2 1s, output 3.\n\nBut in the fourth row, the output is 3 0 3 3, which has four 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is different. Let me think about the output grids. The outputs in Example 1 have mostly 3s and one 0. So perhaps the rule is that if there's at least one 1, output is 3, else 0. That would fit the first three rows, but not the fourth row of Example 1, which has two 1s, so output should be all 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that if there's at least one non-zero, output is 3, else 0. Let's test:\n\nFirst row: 1s, output 3.\n\nSecond row: 1s, output 3.\n\nThird row: 1s, output 3.\n\nFourth row: 1s, output 3.\n\nBut in the fourth row of Example 1, the output is 3 0 3 3, which has two 0s and two 1s. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that if there's at least one 1, all 1s become 3 and 0s become 3. That doesn't fit the second row, which has two 1s and two 0s, output is 0 3 0 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 1 in the input row is considered a \"1\" and becomes 3, 0s become 0, and the number of 1s is counted. If the count is odd, output is 3; even, 0. Let's test:\n\nFirst row: 2 1s, even, output 0. But first row output is 3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, if the count is 1 or more, output is 3, else 0. But first row has 2 1s, output is 3.\n\nSecond row: 2 1s, output is 3.\n\nThird row: 1 1, output is 3.\n\nFourth row: 2 1s, output is 3.\n\nBut in the fourth row, the output is 3 0 3 3, which has two 1s and two 0s, but the output isn't all 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that any 1 in the input row becomes 3, and 0s become 0. So for the fourth row, two 1s become 3, and two 0s become 0, but the output is 3 0 3 3, which has three 3s and one 0. So that contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a different rule altogether. Let me check the second example.\n\nIn Example 2, let's look at the second row of input: 0 1 0 1. Output is 0 3 0 3. So two 1s, output is 0 and 3 in the second and fourth positions. So perhaps when a row has 1s, the output is 3s and 0s where the input is 0. That fits the first row of Example 2, where input is 1 1 1 0, output is 3 3 3 3, which has three 3s and one 0. Wait, that contradicts the second row.\n\nWait, in the second row of Example 2, input is 0 1 ", -0.25], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I've got to figure out the common rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or rules that apply consistently. Let's start with Example 1:\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput Grid:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\n\nOutput Grid:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nHmm, looking at the input and output, it seems like the output values can be determined by some combination of the input values. Let's see if there's a bitwise operation involved, like XOR or AND.\n\nWait, the output values are mostly 3s, except for some positions. I notice that in the first row of the output, all four values are 3. That might mean that in some cases, the rule leads to a high value, perhaps indicating a logical OR or some similar operation.\n\nLet me try applying a bitwise OR operation to the input values. For example, if I take two adjacent cells, say 1 and 1, their OR would be 1. Similarly, 1 and 0 would give 1, and 0 and 0 would give 0. But looking at the output, it's not always 1; it's mostly 3s, which I assume represent a logical OR result.\n\nWait, but in the first row of the output, all four values are 3. That suggests that in that particular row of the input, the rule might be applying a logical OR regardless of the input values. Or perhaps it's a different operation altogether.\n\nLet's consider another approach: maybe the sum of the input values. For example, if I sum two adjacent cells in the input, what would that be? Let's take the first row of the input: 1, 1, 0, 0. The sum is 2. But the output value is 3, which is higher. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the maximum value of each pair. For the first row, the maximum is 1, but the output is 3. That doesn't match. Maybe it's not that either.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's based on the number of 1s in a certain pattern. For instance, if there are two 1s in a row, the output might be 3. But in the first example, the first row of the input has 1,1,0,0, which has two 1s. The output for that position is 3, which fits that idea.\n\nLooking at the output grid, the first row is all 3s, which might mean that in the first row, the rule applies regardless of the input. So perhaps the rule is: for each cell, if it's part of a 2x2 block where there are two 1s, then the output is 3; otherwise, it's 0. But wait, the output isn't always 3; some cells are 3 and others are 0.\n\nWait, the output in the first row is all 3s, so maybe the rule is that when two adjacent cells in a row are 1s, the output is 3. Let me check another row. \n\nLooking at the output grid, the second row is 0,3,3,3. So perhaps the rule is that in the second row, any cell that is adjacent to a 1 in the first row would result in a 3. But I'm not sure if that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is based on the sum of adjacent cells. For example, if two adjacent cells sum to 2, then the output is 3. Let's see: in the first row, 1+1=2, so output is 3; 0+1=1, so output is 0; 1+0=1, output is 0; 0+0=0, output is 0. But the output is 3,0,0,0, which doesn't match the second row. So that might not be the rule.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the presence of a certain pattern, like a diagonal. For example, in the first row, the first cell is adjacent to a diagonal of 1s, which might result in a 3. But this is speculative.\n\nLet me try to look for a different approach. Perhaps the output is the sum of the two input cells in a certain position, modulo 4. For example, 1+1=2, but output is 3. 1+0=1, output is 0. 0+1=1, output is 0. 0+0=0, output is 0. That doesn't fit. So that's probably not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the result of a bitwise operation, like XOR. Let's try that: 1 XOR 1 = 0, which doesn't match the output of 3. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the bitwise OR, as I thought earlier. Let's check: 1 OR 1 = 1, which would correspond to 3. 1 OR 0 = 1, 0 OR 1 = 1, 0 OR 0 = 0. But in the output, the first row is all 3s, so maybe in that case, the rule applies regardless of the input. Or perhaps the rule is applied per 2x2 block, where two 1s are present, and the output cell is 3.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the output is determined by the number of 1s in a 2x2 block. For example, a 2x2 block with two 1s would result in 3, while a block with three or four 1s would result in 3 or 3, respectively. But in the first row, the block has two 1s, so output is 3. In the second row, the block has one 1, so output is 0. That might fit the output grid.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with another example. Take the third row of the output: 3,3,3,3. That suggests that in the third row, the rule always applies, meaning that in that row of input, the 2x2 blocks have two 1s, so the output is 3. In the fourth row, two 1s are present, so the output is also 3. So the rule is that for each 2x2 block, if there are exactly two 1s, the output is 3; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nWait, but in the second row of the output, the first cell is 0, which corresponds to a 2x2 block with only one 1, so that fits. So maybe that's the rule.\n\nWait, but let's check another example to confirm. Take Example 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nWait, in the first row of the output, all four cells are 3, which suggests that in the first row of the input, the 2x2 blocks have two 1s, so the output is 3. In the second row, the first cell has only one 1 in the 2x2 block, so output is 0. In the third row, four 1s, so output is 3. In the fourth row, three 1s, so output is 3. That fits the rule I thought of earlier.\n\nBut wait, in the third row of the output, the second cell is 3 and the others are 3 as well, which fits the rule.\n\nSo, based on these observations, the rule seems to be: for each 2x2 block in the input, if there are exactly two 1s, the corresponding output cell is 3; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nLet me apply this rule to another example to confirm. Take Example 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nWait, the first row of the output is 3,3,0,3. That doesn't fit my previous rule. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine Example 1's output. The first row is 3,3,3,3, which suggests that in the first row of the input, the 2x2 blocks have two 1s, so the output is 3. In the second row of the input, the first cell has only one 1, so output is 0, which matches the output's first column. In the second row of the output, the first cell is 0, which corresponds to a 2x2 block with one 1. The second cell is 3, which might correspond to a 2x2 block with two 1s. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the 2x2 blocks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for each cell, if the cell itself is 1, then it's the sum of its adjacent cells (top, bottom, left, right) modulo 4. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's try another approach. Maybe the output is the sum of all 1s in the 2x2 block, plus one. For example, if a 2x2 block has two 1s, the sum is 2, plus one is 3. If it has one 1, sum is 1, plus one is 2; but in the output, it's 0 for that case. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of 1s modulo 4, but that doesn't match the outputs either.\n\nLet me try looking for a different pattern. Maybe the output is determined by the sum of the two input diagonally adjacent cells. Wait, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the output is the result of applying a certain function to the sum of the input cells. For example, if two adjacent cells sum to 2, the output is 3; otherwise, it's 0. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of the input has two 1s adjacent, so output is 3. The second cell has 1 and 0, sum is 1, so output is 0. The third cell has 0 and 1, sum is 1, output is 0. The fourth cell has 0 and 0, sum is 0, output is 0. That matches the first row of the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row of the input has 1,1,1,0. The adjacent pairs are 1+1=2 (output 3), 1+1=2 (output 3), and 1+0=1 (output 0). But the output first row is 3,3,3,3, which doesn't fit because the last cell should be 0. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum of two adjacent cells. For example, if two adjacent cells are 1 and 0, the output is 1. If both are 1, output is 1. If both are 0, output is 0. But in Example 1, the first row has two 1s, output is 3, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm not getting anywhere with this line of thinking. Maybe I need to look for another approach. Let's consider that the output grid might be derived from some transformation of the input grid, such as taking the bitwise OR of each 2x2 block with a certain pattern.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the output is determined by the number of 1s in a certain pattern. For example, every other cell is 3, but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, looking at Example 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\nIn the first row of the output, the first three cells are 3, and the last is 0. That suggests that in the first row of the input, the 2x2 blocks have three 1s, so the output is 3; but in some cases, maybe it's different. Wait, in the first row of the input, the cells are 1,0,1,0. So each 2x2 block in the first row would have one 1, so output should be 0. But in the output, they are 3. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that if the sum of the two cells in a diagonal is 2, then the output is 3. For example, in a 2x2 block, if the top-left and bottom-right cells sum to 2, output is 3; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's first row: 1,1,0,0. The 2x2 blocks are:\n1 1\n0 0\n\nTop-left and bottom-right sum to 1+0=1, so output is 0, but in the output, it's 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is the sum of all four cells in the 2x2 block modulo 4. For a block with two 1s, sum is 2, output is 3. For a block with one 1, sum is 1, output is 0. For a block with three 1s, sum is 3, output is 3. For four 1s, sum is 4, output is 0.\n\nWait, let's test this with Example 1:\n\nFirst row input: 1,1,0,0\nSum of the 2x2 block is 1+1+0+0=2, output is 3.\n\nSecond row input: 0,1,0,1\nSum is 0+1+0+1=2, output is 3.\n\nThird row input: 0,1,0,0\nSum is 0+1+0+0=1, output is 0.\n\nFourth row input: 1,0,1,0\nSum is 1+0+1+0=2, output is 3.\n\nSo the first row of the output matches the rule: 2 mod 4 is 2, output is 3.\n\nSecond row of output is 0, which would correspond to a sum of 1, output is 0.\n\nThird row of output is 3, sum is 2, output is 3.\n\nFourth row of output is 3, sum is 2, output is 3.\n\nThat fits. Let's check another example, like Example 2.\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n\nFirst 2x2 block:\n1+1+0+0=2, output 3.\n\nSecond block:\n1+1+1+0=3, output 3.\n\nThird block:\n0+0+0+1=1, output 0.\n\nFourth block:\n1+0+1+1=3, output 3.\n\nBut the output is 0,3,3,3. Wait, that doesn't match my previous conclusion. Hmm, maybe the rule is not consistent across all examples.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rule. Maybe the output is determined by the sum of the cells in a certain pattern, but not necessarily each 2x2 block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the sum of the four cells in a 2x2 block, but taking the maximum of that sum and 1, but that doesn't fit the first example.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the first row of the output is 0,3,3,3. That suggests that the first cell's output is 0, which would correspond to a sum of 1. But the first 2x2 block's sum is 1+1+0+0=2, which would output 3, not 0. So that contradicts my previous idea.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for another pattern. Let me consider that the output is derived from the sum of the two cells in a certain way, perhaps in a diagonal.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output for the first row is 3,3,3,3. That suggests that each cell in that row is 3, which might mean that each cell is the sum of its two adjacent cells in some pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the two cells in a diagonal, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the output grid is the result of applying a certain transformation to the input grid, such as taking the bitwise OR of each 2x2 block with a specific pattern.\n\nWait, let's try that. For each 2x2 block, if the top-left and bottom-right cells are both 1, then the output is 3. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nTesting this with Example 1's first row: 1,1,0,0. The 2x2 block has 1 and 0, which are not both 1, so output should be 0. But in the output, it's 3, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is determined by the number of 1s in the 2x2 block. For example, two 1s result in ", -0.25], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let's calculate the sum of each row in the input:\n\nRow 1: 1+1+0+0 = 2\nRow 2: 0+1+0+1 = 2\nRow 3: 0+1+0+0 = 1\nRow 4: 1+0+1+0 = 2\nRow 5: 4+4+4+4 = 16\nRow 6: 2+2+2+2 = 8\nRow 7: 0+0+2+2 = 4\nRow 8: 2+2+0+0 = 4\nRow 9: 0+0+2+2 = 4\n\nThe output rows are as follows:\n3,3,3,3 \u2192 sum 12\n0,3,3,3 \u2192 sum 9\n3,3,0,0 \u2192 sum 6\n3,0,3,3 \u2192 sum 9\n\nLooking at the sums, the output sums don't directly correspond to the input sums. For example, an input sum of 16 (row 5) produces an output sum of 12. Similarly, the row with sum 8 (row 6) produces 9. It's unclear if there's a direct relationship here.\n\nNext, I'll look at the second example:\n\nInput Grid:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\n\nOutput Grid:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nAgain, the output is mostly 3s, with some 0s and 2s. Let's calculate the sums:\n\nRow 1: 1+1+1+0 = 3\nRow 2: 0+1+0+1 = 2\nRow 3: 0+0+1+1 = 2\nRow 4: 1+1+0+1 = 3\nRow 5: 4+4+4+4 = 16\nRow 6: 0+0+0+2 = 2\nRow 7: 0+0+0+2 = 2\nRow 8: 2+2+2+2 = 8\nRow 9: 2+2+0+2 = 6\n\nOutput sums:\n3,0,3,3 \u2192 sum 9\n2,3,3,3 \u2192 sum 11\n3,3,3,3 \u2192 sum 12\n3,3,0,3 \u2192 sum 9\n\nAgain, the sums don't directly relate to the input sums. The output seems more influenced by the presence of 2s in the input, as they produce higher numbers like 3 or 0, whereas 1s are higher but perhaps not.\n\nLooking at the third example to see if the rule is consistent:\n\nInput Grid:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 2 2 0\n\nOutput Grid:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nCalculating the sums:\n\nInput rows:\n1+1+0+0=2\n1+0+1+0=2\n1+1+0+1=3\n1+1+1+1=4\n4+4+4+4=16\n2+2+0+2=6\n0+0+2+0=2\n0+2+0+0=2\n2+2+2+0=6\n\nOutput sums:\n3+3+0+3=9\n3+0+3+0=6\n3+3+0+3=9\n3+3+3+3=12\n\nAgain, the output sums are 9,6,9,12 for the respective input sums of 2,2,3,4,16,6,2,2,6.\n\nThis suggests that the output sum depends on the input sum, but it's not a direct one-to-one relationship. Perhaps the rule involves more than just the sum of the cells.\n\nLooking at the individual cells in the output grid, I can see that they are either 0, 3, or 3, except for the second row which has a 0. This might indicate that certain cells are being set to 3 based on some condition, while others are 0, which could happen if the condition is not met.\n\nFor example, in the first output row, all cells are 3, which might mean that all cells in that row satisfy some condition. In the second output row, one cell is 0, so not all cells in that row satisfy the condition.\n\nLooking at the input grid, I can see that each row has two 1s and two 0s, except for the row with all 4s and the rows with 2s and 0s. The output grid seems to be influenced by the presence of 1s and 0s in the input, as well as the sum of certain cells.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a pattern in how the output is generated. Maybe each cell in the output grid is determined by some function of the corresponding cells in the input grid. For example, the output cell could be the sum modulo 4, or some other operation.\n\nLooking at the cells in the output grid, I notice that 3 is the highest value, which could indicate that the output is dependent on some majority or threshold condition. For example, if the input cell is 1, it contributes to the output as 3, while if it's 0, it doesn't. However, looking at the examples, this might not hold because in some cases, 2s are present and output as 0 or 3.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be influenced by the presence of 2s in the input. For example, if a cell in the input is 2, it might convert to 3 in the output, while 1s stay as 1s or 3s based on other conditions.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output grid is a transformation of the input grid based on some rule, such as a bitwise operation or a linear transformation. For example, each output cell might be the sum of certain input cells modulo a number.\n\nLooking at the second example again, the output grid has 3s and 0s. The cells with 3s seem to be in the majority of the rows, indicating that perhaps the rule involves checking if the majority of cells in a row are 1 or 0, and setting the output accordingly. However, the presence of 2s complicates this because 2s are neither 0 nor 1, so they might affect the majority.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could involve the sum of certain cells. For example, if the sum of a row's cells is even, it might produce a certain output, but this doesn't seem to fit the examples.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a pattern in how the output grid is derived from the input grid. For instance, each output cell could be determined by the maximum or minimum value in a certain subset of the input grid. However, this is speculative without more data.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the rule is that the output grid is derived by applying a transformation where each cell is set to 3 if the corresponding input cell is 1 or 2, and to 0 if it's 0, with some exceptions based on the sum or the presence of 2s. However, without a clear pattern, it's challenging to define the exact rule.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output grid is generated by counting the number of 1s and 2s in each row and column and applying a rule that sets certain cells to 3 based on their position, with 0s and 2s serving as exceptions. However, this is a rough guess and may not be accurate.\n</think>", -0.25], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples given to see if I can spot a pattern or a common rule.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 6x4 grid, and the output is another 6x4 grid. Each cell in the output seems to depend on some combination of the cells in the corresponding row and column of the input. Let me take a closer look at a specific cell in the input and output.\n\nFor instance, let's look at the first cell of the output, which is 3. The input grid's first row is 1, 1, 0, 0, and the first column is 1, 0, 0, 1. Hmm, how does 3 come from these numbers? Maybe it's a count or some operation.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the row or column. Let me check another cell. The output cell is 3, and the input cell is 4 in one of the rows. That doesn't seem to align. Maybe it's more about the individual cells.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each output cell is determined by the XOR of some values, but I'm not sure yet. Let me try to think differently. Maybe each output cell is calculated by checking certain positions in the input grid.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input is also 6x4, and the output is similar. The output cell values are 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3. It seems like in some rows, the output cell is 0, and in others, it's 3. Let me see if that's consistent with the input.\n\nFor example, in the input of Example 2, the first row is 1,1,1,0. The output row is 3,3,3,3. So all 3s in the output. The second row of the input is 0,1,0,1, which results in 0,3,3,3. So the first and third output cells are 3, and the second is 0. Maybe some pattern based on the input row.\n\nWait, perhaps each output cell is the minimum of the corresponding input row or column. Let me test that. In Example 1, the first cell of the output is 3. The input row is 1,1,0,0, and the input column is 1,0,0,1. The minimum of 1 and 1 is 1, which isn't 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe it's the count of 1s in the row or column. Let me check. For the first row in Example 1, there are 2 ones, but the output is 3. That doesn't match. The first cell in the output is 3, but the input has 1,1,0,0. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the number of overlapping 1s between the row and column. Let me see. For the first row, the input has two 1s. Looking at the first column, the input has two 1s as well. So maybe the output is 2? But the first output cell is 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe it's the sum of the input row and column. Let's try that. For example, the first cell in the output: 3 = 1 (row) + 0 (column) = 1, which isn't 3. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the row and column's 1s multiplied by something. Let me think differently. Maybe each output cell is determined by the number of 1s in the overlapping area of the row and column.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the number of 1s in the row OR the number of 1s in the column. Let me test that. For the first row, two 1s. For the first column, two 1s. OR gives 2, but the output is 3. So that's not it.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe each output cell is the sum of the input row and column, modulo 3 or something. Let me try that. For example, the first row sum is 2, the first column sum is 2. 2 + 2 = 4, which mod something could be 1, but the output is 3. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe it's related to the number of 1s in the row and column, but considering their positions. Let me think about the positions where the input is 1. For example, in the first row of Example 1, there are 1s in the first and second columns. In the first column, there's a 1 in the first row and a 0 in the second row, etc. Maybe the output cell is the count of overlapping 1s with the input row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cell is the count of 1s in the row or column, but adjusted by some value. Let me think about Example 3. The first output cell is 3, which is the sum of 1s in that row (maybe 4?), but that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the input row and column, but then divided by something. Let me think: For the first row in Example 1, 1+1+0+0 = 2. The first column is 1+0+0+1 = 2. Sum is 4, divided by something gives 3. Maybe 4 divided by (something) is 3, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output grid and see if there's a transformation that can be applied to the entire grid. The input grid is 6x4, and the output is also 6x4. Each cell in the output depends on some combination of the input's row and column.\n\nWait, maybe each output cell is the sum of the input row and column, modulo 3. Let me test that. For the first cell in Example 1, input row sum is 2, input column sum is 1 (from 1,0,0,1). So 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the output. Let's check another cell. For example, the first output row is 3,3,3,3. The first input row is 1,1,0,0 (sum 2), and the corresponding column sums are 1 (first column), 0 (second column), 0 (third column), 1 (fourth column). So 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 4, modulo 3 is 1, but the output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the minimum of the row and column sums. For the first cell, row sum is 2, column sum is 1. Min is 1, but output is 3. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the row and column, multiplied by some factor. Let's see. In Example 1, first cell: row sum 2, column sum 1. 2+1=3, and the output is 3. That fits. Let's check another cell. In the same example, the second output cell is 3. Input row sum is 2, column sum is 3 (from 0,1,0,1). 2+3=5, which mod 3 is 2, but the output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output cell is the sum of the row and column's 1s, but then divided by 2. Let's test. For first cell: 2+1=3, divided by 2 is 1.5, but output is 3. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the row and column's 1s, but then adding 1. Let's see. 2+1+1=4, which isn't 3. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output cell is determined by the number of overlapping 1s between the row and column, plus 1. Let's try. For the first cell, row has 1s in positions 1 and 2, column has 1s in positions 1 and 4. So overlapping is position 1. So 1 +1=2, which isn't 3. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of 1s in the row plus the number of 1s in the column, minus the number of 1s in the intersection. Let's calculate. For the first cell, row has 2 ones, column has 2 ones. The intersection is 1 one. So 2+2-1=3, which matches the output. Let's test another cell. For example, the first output row is 3,3,3,3. Let's take the first cell again. Row has 2 ones, column has 2 ones. Intersection is 1 one. So 2+2-1=3, which matches. Let's check another cell. Take the second cell in the output row. It's 3. The input row is 1,0,1,0 (sum 2), and the input column is 0,1,0,1 (sum 2). Intersection: row has 1 in position 1, column has 1 in position 2. So overlapping is 1, so 2+2-1=3. That fits. Let's check another cell. The third output cell is 3. Input row is 0,1,0,0 (sum 1), input column is 0,0,1,1 (sum 2). Intersection: row has 1 in position 2, column has 2 in positions 3 and 4. So overlapping is 1 (position 2). So 1+2-1=2, but the output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, so this theory works for some cells but not all. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the count of 1s in the row or column, depending on the position. Let me think differently. Maybe each output cell is the sum of the row's 1s and the column's 1s, minus the minimum of the row and column's 1s. Let's test that. For the first cell: row has 2, column has 2, min is 1. So 2+2-1=3, which fits. For the second cell in the output row: row has 1, column has 2, min is 1. So 1+2-1=2, but the output is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe it's the sum of the row and column's 1s, but then adding 1. For the first cell: 2+2+1=5, which mod 3 is 2, but output is 3. So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the row and column's 1s, then subtract the maximum of the two. Let's try. For the first cell: 2+2-2=2, which isn't 3. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the row and column's 1s, minus the minimum of the two. Let's test. 2+2-1=3, which fits. For the second cell in the output row: row has 1, column has 2, min is 1. So 1+2-1=2, but the output is 3. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the output. Each output cell seems to be either 0 or 3 in some rows. Let me check how that happens. For example, in Example 1, the second row of the output is 0,3,3,3. So the first cell is 0, and the rest are 3s. Why is that? Maybe when the corresponding input row has a 0 in the first column, the output cell becomes 0. Let me check that. In the input, the first column has 1,0,0,1. So the first, third, and sixth cells are 1 in the first column. The second cell in the output row is 0, which corresponds to the first column having 1. Wait, maybe when the input row has a 0 in the first column, the output cell is 0. Let me check other cells. For example, in the first input row, first column is 1, and the first output cell is 3. So that contradicts. Maybe it's not just the first column.\n\nWait, perhaps it's based on the entire row and column. Let me think about the first column. It has two 1s and two 0s. In the output, the first cell is 3, and the fifth cell is 3. Let me see if there's a pattern in the first column. Maybe when the input column has a 1, the output cell is 3, and when it's 0, it's 0. Let me check. The first column has 1,0,0,1. So the first input cell is 1, which in the output is 3. The second input cell is 0, which in the output is 0. Third input cell is 0, output is 0. Fourth input cell is 1, output is 3. So maybe the output cell is 3 if the input cell is 1, and 0 if it's 0. That seems to fit. So perhaps the output cell is determined by the input cell.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the second row input has 0,1,0,1. The output is 0,3,3,3. So the first cell is 0, which matches the input being 0. The other cells are 3. So maybe when the input row has a 0 in the first column, the output cell is 0, and for the other cells, it's 3 if the input cell is 1 and 0 if it's 0. That makes sense.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 3. The first input row is 1,1,0,0. The output row is 3,3,3,3. So all output cells are 3, which matches the input where all cells are 1 and 0. The first column has 1,0,0,2. So the first input cell is 1, which would make the output cell 3. The second input cell is 1, output is 3. Third input cell is 0, output is 3. Fourth input cell is 0, output is 3. So it fits.\n\nAnother test: The second row of Example 3 input is 0,0,1,1. The output row is 3,3,3,3. The first two cells are 0, and the last two are 3. So matches the pattern.\n\nIn Example 2, the second row input is 0,1,0,1. The output row is 0,3,3,3. First cell is 0 (input is 0), others are 3 (input is 1 or 1). So it fits.\n\nIn Example 4, the second row input is 0,1,0,1. Output row is 3,3,3,3. So it fits.\n\nSo based on this, it seems that the output cell is determined by the input cell. If the input cell is 1, the output cell is 3; if it's 0, the output cell is 0.\n\nWait, but let me check another cell in Example 3. The third row input is 1,0,1,0. The output row is 3,3,3,3. The first, third, and sixth cells are 1, so output is 3. The second and fourth cells are 0, so output is 0. So it fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the third row input is 0,1,0,1. Output row is 3,3,3,3. So first cell is 0, others are 3.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the second row input is 0,1,0,1, output is 0,3,3,3. So first cell is 0, others are 3.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: each output cell is 3 if the corresponding input cell is 1, and 0 if it's 0.\n\nBut let me check another cell in Example 4. The second row input is 0,1,0,1. Output row is 3,3,3,3. So matches the rule.\n\nSo the output grid is constructed by replacing 1s with 3s and 0s with 0s in the input grid.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any exceptions. For example, in Example 3, the third row input is 1,1,0,1. The output row is 3,3,3,3. So all 1s become 3s, which fits the rule.\n\nAnother example: The fourth row input is 0,0,2,0. The output row is 3,3,3,3. So 2 becomes 3, which seems to fit if 2 is treated as 3. So maybe in the output grid, any number greater than 0 is replaced by 3, and 0 remains 0.\n\nSo the rule is: each output cell is 3 if the corresponding input cell is 1 or 2, and 0 if it's 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the third row input is 1,0,1,0. The output is 3,3,3,3. So 1 becomes 3, which matches the rule.\n\nAnother example: The fourth row input is 0,0,2,0. The output is 3,3,3,3. So 2 becomes 3, which fits.\n\nBut in Example 4, the second row input is 0,1,0,1. The output is 3,3,3,3. So 1 becomes 3, which fits.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the second row input is 1,0,1,0. The output is 3,3,3,3. So 1 becomes 3, which fits.\n\nSo, the rule is: each output cell is 3 if the corresponding input cell is 1 or 2, and 0 if it's 0.\n\nWait, but in Example 3, the third row input is 1,0,1,0.

I'm not exactly a puzzle expert, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the examples provided. Each example has an input grid and an output grid. I need to find a pattern that links each corresponding cell in the input to the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nHmm, the output grid has a lot of 3s and 0s, while the input grid has 1s, 0s, and 4s. So, it's likely that the rule involves some operations on the input values to produce the output.\n\nLet me look at the first row of the input and output. Input row: 1 1 0 0. Output row: 3 3 3 3. All cells are 3. Maybe the rule is to output 3 when certain conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the first cell of the input, which is 1. The output is 3. Maybe it's related to the value of the input. If I add 1 to 1, I get 2, but output is 3. Maybe it's 1 + 2 = 3, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet's check another cell. Suppose the input is 0. Output is 0, so maybe 0 for some condition. Input 1 becomes 3; perhaps it's 1 multiplied by 3? But I don't have enough information yet.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nAgain, output has 3s and 0s. The input has 1s, 0s, 4s, and 2s. Maybe the rule involves some operations on the input values.\n\nLet me think about possible operations. Subtraction, addition, multiplication, modulo, etc. Let's take the first row of input and see what happens.\n\nInput row 1: 1 1 1 0\nOutput row 1: 3 3 3 3\n\nIf I subtract 1 from 4, I get 3. So maybe the rule is to subtract the input value from 4 when the input is 1, 2, or 0. But wait, the output is 3 in this case.\n\nLet me check another cell. Suppose the input is 1, the output is 3. If I take 4 minus 1, that's 3. If the input is 0, then 4 minus 0 is 4, but the output is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input plus 2, but 1+2=3, 0+2=2, but output is 0. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, maybe the output is based on the sum of the input values. Let's calculate the sum of the first row of input in Example 1:\n\n1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2. But the output is 3. Maybe 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nIn Example 2, first row input sum: 1+1+1+0 = 3, output is 3. That fits. Let's check another row.\n\nInput row in Example 1: 0 1 0 1. Sum is 0+1+0+1=2. Output is 0. Hmm, no. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum value in the row. For example 1, the first row has 1,1,0,0. The maximum is 1, but output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the smallest value in the row. Input row 1 has 0, which is the smallest, but output is 3. No.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of the input plus 1. For example 1, first row sum is 2, plus 1 is 3. That fits.\n\nIn Example 2, first row sum is 3, plus 1 is 4, but output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the maximum value multiplied by 2. For example 1, sum is 2, multiplied by 2 is 4, but output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum minus 1. For example 1, sum is 2, minus 1 is 1, but output is 3. No.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the input value plus 2 if the input is 1. Let's see:\n\nInput cell is 1, output 3. So 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nIf input is 0, output is 0, which fits.\n\nInput is 2, output is 0? Wait, in Example 1, the second row of input is 0 1 0 1, output is 0 3 3 3. So for input 0, output 0. For input 1, output 3.\n\nIf input is 2, output is 0? Let's check another row.\n\nInput row in Example 1: 0 1 0 0, sum is 1, output is 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the input values, and then subtract 1, then take modulo 4.\n\nIn example 1:\n\nFirst row sum is 2. 2 -1 =1. 1 mod 4 is 1. Output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum plus 1, modulo 4.\n\nSum +1 =3, 3 mod4=3. That fits.\n\nLet's check another row.\n\nInput row: 0 1 0 1. Sum is 2. 2+1=3. 3 mod4=3. Output is 3. Fits.\n\nAnother row: 0 1 0 0. Sum is 1. 1+1=2, mod4=2. Output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, no.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum multiplied by 2, modulo 4.\n\nSum +1 for each cell:\n\nSum is 2. 2*2=4 mod4=0, but output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum plus 1, then modulo 4.\n\nSum +1 =3, mod4=3. Fits.\n\nSum=1: 1+1=2, mod4=2. Output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the output is the sum of the input values, plus the number of 1s. Let's see.\n\nIn example1, first row sum is 2, number of 1s is 2. 2+2=4, mod4=0. Output is 3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum of input multiplied by 3. 2*3=6 mod4=2. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the input plus the number of 1s. For example1, sum 2, 1s 2. 2+2=4 mod4=0. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the maximum value in each row multiplied by 3. For example1, first row max 1, 1*3=3. Fits. Second row max 1, 3. Fits. Third row max 1, 3. Fits. Fourth row max 1, 3. Fits. Fifth row max4, 4*3=12 mod4=0, output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the input values multiplied by 2. For example1, sum 2, 2*2=4 mod4=0, output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm not getting it right. Maybe I need to look at another example.\n\nLooking at Example3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 2 2 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nLooking at the first row of input:1 1 0 0. Output is3 3 0 3.\n\nSum of input:2. 2*3=6 mod4=2. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, sum+1:3. 3 mod4=3. Fits.\n\nSecond row input:1 0 1 0. Sum=2. 2+1=3. 3 mod4=3. Output is3. Fits.\n\nThird row input:1 1 0 1. Sum=3. 3+1=4 mod4=0. Output is0. Fits.\n\nFourth row input:1 1 1 1. Sum=4. 4+1=5 mod4=1. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, so the rule might be sum+1 mod4, but it fails for the fourth row.\n\nWait, maybe it's (sum +1) mod4.\n\nFirst row:2+1=3 mod4=3. Fits.\n\nSecond row:2+1=3 mod4=3. Fits.\n\nThird row:3+1=4 mod4=0. Fits.\n\nFourth row:4+1=5 mod4=1. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nFirst row:1 1 1 0.

Let me look at another example.\n\nLooking at Example4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\nFirst row:1 0 1 0. Sum=2. 2+1=3. Output is3. Fits.\n\nSecond row:1 1 0 1. Sum=3. 3+1=4 mod4=0. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum multiplied by 2, then subtract 1, then mod4.\n\nSum is 2: 4-1=3 mod4=3. Fits.\n\nSum is3:6-1=5 mod4=1. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, output is the sum multiplied by 3, mod4.\n\n2*3=6 mod4=2. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum value in the row multiplied by 3.\n\nFirst row max is1:3. Fits.\n\nSecond row max is1:3. Fits.\n\nThird row max is1:3. Fits.\n\nFourth row max is1:3. Fits.\n\nFifth row max is4:12 mod4=0. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the output is the sum multiplied by 3, then mod4, but for the fifth row, 4*3=12 mod4=0, but output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's see the fifth row in example4: the output is3. So 4*3=12 mod4=0, but output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example2 again:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nLooking at the second row of output:0 3 0 3.\n\nInput row:0 1 0 1. Sum is2. Output is0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the input row's sum multiplied by 3, then mod4.\n\nSum of first row:3. 3*3=9 mod4=1. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the input values plus the count of 1s, mod4.\n\nSum=2, count of 1s=3. 2+3=5 mod4=1. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find another approach. Let's consider that each cell in the output is determined by some function of the input's values in the same row.\n\nLooking at the first row of example1:\n\nInput:1 1 0 0. Output:3 3 3 3.\n\nIf I add 2 to each input cell and mod4, let's see:\n\n1+2=3. 1+2=3. 0+2=2. But output is3 for all. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum multiplied by 2, mod4.\n\nSum=2*2=4 mod4=0. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's sum plus 1, mod4.\n\nSum+1=3 mod4=3. Fits.\n\nSecond row:1 1 0 0. Sum=2. 2+1=3. All cells are3. Fits.\n\nThird row:0 1 0 0. Sum=1. 1+1=2. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the maximum value in the row multiplied by 3.\n\nFirst row max=1. 3. Fits.\n\nSecond row max=1. 3. Fits.\n\nThird row max=1. 3. Fits.\n\nFourth row max=1. 3. Fits.\n\nFifth row max=4. 12 mod4=0, output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum multiplied by 3, then mod4.\n\nFirst row sum=2. 2*3=6 mod4=2. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let's look at example3's output. The first row is3 3 0 3.\n\nInput row:1 1 0 0.\n\nIf I subtract 1 from each input cell:\n\n1-1=0, 1-1=0, 0-1=-1, 0-1=-1.\n\nBut output is3 for all. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum plus 1, mod4.\n\nSum=2. 2+1=3 mod4=3. Fits.\n\nSecond row input:1 0 1 0. Sum=2. 2+1=3. Fits.\n\nThird row input:1 1 0 1. Sum=3. 3+1=4 mod4=0. Output is0. Fits.\n\nFourth row input:1 1 1 1. Sum=4. 4+1=5 mod4=1. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum multiplied by 3, then mod4.\n\nFirst row sum=2:6 mod4=2. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum multiplied by 3, then mod4, but if sum is 4, output is 1 instead of 0.\n\nBut in example3, the fourth row is sum=4, output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nI'm not making progress with this approach. Maybe I should think differently. Let's consider that each cell in the output is determined by some operation on the input values. Perhaps it's based on the bitwise operations.\n\nLooking at example1:\n\nInput row:1 1 0 0.\n\nSuppose I add 2 to each cell: 3 3 2 2. But output is3 3 3 3. Close, but not exactly.\n\nWait, maybe it's the bitwise OR of the input values. For example1, all cells are 1, so OR is1. Output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's the bitwise XOR. For example1, all 1s XORed is1, but output is3. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the input values multiplied by 3, then mod4.\n\nFirst row sum=2:", -0.25], ["0", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 0 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 2\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0\n2 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3\n3 0 3 0\n3 3 0 3\n3 3 3 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\nOutput:\n3 3 3 0\n3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 2\n2 2 2 0\nOutput:<|user|><|assistant|><think>\n", "Alright, let's try to figure out the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. I'll start by carefully analyzing the given examples to spot any patterns or relationships between the input and output cells.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n4 4 4 4\n2 2 2 2\n0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2\n\nOutput:\n3 3 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n3 3 0 0\n3 0 3 3\n\nI notice that the output grid has a consistent number of 3s and 0s. Each row in the output seems to have a similar pattern, with mostly 3s and a few 0s or 3s. This suggests that the rule might involve some comparison between the input cells and their neighbors.\n\nNext, I'll look at a specific cell in the input and see what it maps to in the output. Let's take the cell with value 1 in the first row, first column. In the output, this cell has a 3. So, perhaps the rule involves counting certain features of the surrounding cells.\n\nI'll try to see if the output cell's value depends on the sum of its neighboring cells or some other function. For instance, if a cell's value is 1 in the input, does it map to 3 in the output? Or perhaps it depends on the number of 1s or 0s in its vicinity.\n\nLooking at another cell with 0 in the input, say 0 0 1 0 in the input, it maps to a 0 in the output. So, maybe the rule is that if the input cell is 0, the output cell is 0. That would explain the 0 0 2 2 mapping to 0 0 0 3. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell is determined by the number of 1s in the input row or column. For example, if there are three 1s in a row, the output cell might be 3. But I need to verify this with the given examples.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a transformation function that could take the input vector and produce the output vector. Since the output seems to be a consistent number of 3s and 0s, maybe it's based on the sum of the input values, but adjusted to a specific range.\n\nWait, perhaps the output cell's value is determined by the count of 1s in the corresponding 2x2 neighborhood of the input. For example, in the first cell, with a 1 in the input, if there are two 1s in the 2x2 neighborhood, it might map to 3. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1's Input, the top-left cell is 1. Looking at its 2x2 neighborhood:\n\n1 1\n0 0\n\nThere are two 1s. Maybe each 2x2 neighborhood contributes to some rule, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves XOR operations or some other logical combination. For example, if the sum of certain cells is greater than a threshold, it maps to 3.\n\nWait, looking at the output, the first row is all 3s. Maybe the first row's output is determined by some function applied to the first row of the input. Let me check:\n\nInput's first row: 1 1 0 0\n\nOutput's first row: 3 3 3 3\n\nMaybe the rule is that if any cell in the input is 1, the corresponding output cell is 3. But then, in the first row, all are 1s, so why all 3s? That fits. Let's check another row.\n\nIn the second row of the output, it's 0 3 3 3. The second row in the input has 0 1 0 1. Maybe the presence of 1s in the input affects the output. So, if the number of 1s in the input row is even or odd, it might influence the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell's value is determined by the number of 1s in the corresponding 2x2 block, but limited to a certain maximum, like 3.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll try to hypothesize a possible rule. For instance, if any of the cells in the input are 1, the output cell might be 3. But let's see if that holds across the examples.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput's first row: 1 1 1 0 \u2192 Output's first row: 3 3 3 3\n\nThat fits. The second row in input: 0 1 0 1 \u2192 Output: 0 3 0 3\n\nWait, in the second row, the first and fourth cells are 0, but the second and third are 1. So, maybe the presence of 1s affects the output. If there are two 1s, it might map to 3, but in this case, the output has 3s in the second and fourth positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell is determined by the sum of its neighboring cells divided by some value. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the rule that the output cell is 3 if any of the input cells in its row or column is 1, and 0 otherwise. Let me test this with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's first row is all 3s, which matches because all input cells are 1. The second row of output has 0 3 3 3, so the only 0 is in the first position, which matches if the first input cell is 1, but in this case, the first input cell is 1, so why is it 0?\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that if any cell in the input row or column is 1, the corresponding output cell is 3, but if all are 0, it's 0. But in the second row of Example 1, the output is 0 3 3 3. The first input cell is 1, so according to this rule, the output should be 3, but it's 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell is 3 only if there is at least one 1 in the input row or column, but if all are 0, it's 0. But again, in Example 1, the second row's output is 0 3 3 3, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output cell is 3 if any of the input cells in the same row or column is 1, and 0 otherwise. But in the second row of Example 1, the first input cell is 1, but the output is 0. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output cell is 3 if the sum of the input cells in its row is greater than a certain threshold. For instance, if the sum is greater than 2, it's 3; otherwise, it's 0. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1's first input row: 1 1 0 0 \u2192 sum is 2 \u2192 output is 3 \u2192 fits.\n\nSecond input row: 0 1 0 1 \u2192 sum is 2 \u2192 output is 3. But the second output row is 0 3 3 3. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell is 3 if the number of 1s in the input row is even, and 0 otherwise. Let's see:\n\nFirst row: 2 ones \u2192 3\n\nSecond row: 2 ones \u2192 3\n\nThird row: 2 ones \u2192 3\n\nFourth row: 2 ones \u2192 3\n\nFifth row: 4 ones \u2192 3\n\nSixth row: 2 ones \u2192 3\n\nSeventh row: 4 ones \u2192 3\n\nEighth row: 2 ones \u2192 3\n\nNinth row: 4 ones \u2192 3\n\nThis fits the first row of the output. The second row of the output is 0 3 3 3. So, the first input cell is 0, but the output is 0. So, this rule doesn't fit the second row.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output cell is 3 if any of the input cells in the same row or column is 1, and 0 otherwise. Let's test this:\n\nIn Example 1, the second row input: 0 1 0 1. The output is 0 3 3 3. The first input cell is 0, so according to the rule, the output should be 0, which matches. The second input cell is 1, so output should be 3, which matches. The third input cell is 0, which would map to 0, but the output is 3. So, this contradicts the rule.\n\nTherefore, the rule isn't simply based on any 1s in the input row or column.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the presence of 1s in the 2x2 neighborhood of each output cell. For example, if any of the four cells in the 2x2 neighborhood is 1, the output cell is 3; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nThe first input row is 1 1 0 0. The 2x2 neighborhoods around each output cell are:\n\nFor the first output cell (1,1):\n1 1\n0 0 \u2192 contains 1s \u2192 output 3\n\nFor the second output cell (1,2):\n1 0\n0 0 \u2192 contains 1s \u2192 output 3\n\nFor the third output cell (1,3):\n1 0\n0 0 \u2192 output 3\n\nFor the fourth output cell (1,4):\n1 0\n0 0 \u2192 output 3\n\nThis fits the first row of the output.\n\nFor the second row input: 0 1 0 1\n\nFor each output cell:\n\n(2,1): 0 1 \u2192 contains 1 \u2192 output 3\n\n(2,2): 1 0 \u2192 contains 1 \u2192 output 3\n\n(2,3): 0 1 \u2192 contains 1 \u2192 output 3\n\n(2,4): 1 0 \u2192 contains 1 \u2192 output 3\n\nBut the second row of the output is 0 3 3 3, which contradicts this. So, this rule isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is based on the sum of the 2x2 neighborhood. For example, if the sum is greater than a certain value, it's 3; otherwise, it's 0.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the sum of each 2x2 neighborhood around the output cells is:\n\n(1,1): 1+1+0+0 = 2 \u2192 output is 3\n\n(1,2): 1+0+0+0 = 1 \u2192 output is 3\n\n(1,3): 1+0+0+0 = 1 \u2192 output is 3\n\n(1,4): 1+0+0+0 = 1 \u2192 output is 3\n\nSo, this fits.\n\nIn the second row of Example 1, the input is 0 1 0 1. The sum of the 2x2 neighborhoods would be:\n\n(2,1): 0+1+0+0 = 1 \u2192 output is 3\n\n(2,2): 1+0+0+0 = 1 \u2192 output is 3\n\n(2,3): 0+1+0+0 = 1 \u2192 output is 3\n\n(2,4): 1+0+0+0 = 1 \u2192 output is 3\n\nBut the second output row is 0 3 3 3, which doesn't fit because the first output cell is 0 instead of 3.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the rule isn't simply based on the sum of the 2x2 neighborhood.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output cell is determined by the number of 1s in its row and column. For example, if any cell in the row or column is 1, the output is 3; otherwise, it's 0. But this doesn't fit the previous example.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output cell is 3 if any of the input cells in its row or column is 1, and 0 otherwise. I'll test this with the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row input: 1 1 0 0 \u2192 all 1s except two 0s. So, output is 3 3 3 3 \u2192 fits.\n\nSecond row input: 0 1 0 1 \u2192 has 1s \u2192 output is 3 3 3 3 \u2192 fits.\n\nThird row input: 0 1 0 0 \u2192 has 1 \u2192 output is 3 3 0 0 \u2192 wait, this doesn't fit because the third cell should be 3, but it's 0.\n\nWait, in Example 1's third output line, it's 3 3 0 0. The third input row is 0 1 0 0. So, in this case, the output is 3 3 0 0, which contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo, this rule is incorrect.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll proceed with the first example's rule and see if it can be adjusted for other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row input is 1 0 1 0. The output is 3 0 3 3.\n\nAccording to the previous rule, since the input row has 1s, the output should be 3. But in the output, the second cell is 0. So, this contradicts the rule.\n\nTherefore, I need to find a different rule that fits all examples.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the parity of the number of 1s in the input. For example, if the number of 1s is odd, the output is 3; if even, it's 0. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nFirst row input: 1+1+0+0=2 \u2192 even \u2192 output is 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSecond row input: 0+1+0+1=2 \u2192 even \u2192 output is 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nThird row input: 0+1+0+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 output is 3 \u2192 but in the output, it's 0 \u2192 incorrect.\n\nSo, this rule doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the majority value in the 2x2 neighborhood. If the majority is 1, output is 3; else, 0.\n\nTesting this:\n\nFirst row input: 1 1 0 0 \u2192 majority 1 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSecond row input: 0 1 0 1 \u2192 majority 1 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nThird row input: 0 1 0 0 \u2192 majority 1 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 but output is 0 \u2192 incorrect.\n\nThus, this rule is also incorrect.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the rule that the output cell is 3 if any of the input cells in the same row or column is 1, and 0 otherwise. I'll test this with the examples provided and see if it fits.\n\nExample 1's first row output is 3 3 3 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nExample 1's second row input is 0 1 0 1 \u2192 output is 3 3 3 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nThird row input is 0 1 0 0 \u2192 output is 3 3 0 0 \u2192 incorrect because the third output cell is 0 instead of 3.\n\nFourth row input is 1 0 1 0 \u2192 output is 3 0 3 3 \u2192 incorrect because the second output cell is 0 instead of 3.\n\nThus, the rule is partially correct but doesn't fit all examples. I'll need to re-examine the examples to find a consistent rule.\n\nAnother idea is that the output cell is 3 if the sum of the input cells in its row or column is greater than a certain value, say 2. For example, if the sum is 2 or more, output is 3; else, 0.\n\nTesting this:\n\nFirst row input sum is 2 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSecond row input sum is 2 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nThird row input sum is 1 \u2192 output 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nFourth row input sum is 2 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 but output is 0 \u2192 incorrect.\n\nSo, this rule is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the number of 1s in the 2x2 neighborhood. If there are two or more 1s, output is 3; else, 0.\n\nTesting this:\n\nFirst row input: 1 1 0 0 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 2 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSecond row input: 0 1 0 1 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 2 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nThird row input: 0 1 0 0 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 1 \u2192 output 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nFourth row input: 1 0 1 0 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 1 \u2192 output 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nThis fits all examples so far.\n\nLet's test this rule with the remaining examples.\n\nExample 2:\n\nFirst input row: 1 1 1 0 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 3 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSecond input row: 0 1 0 1 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 2 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nThird input row: 0 0 1 1 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 2 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nFourth input row: 1 1 0 1 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 3 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nFifth input row: 4 4 4 4 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 0 \u2192 output 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nSixth input row: 0 0 0 2 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 0 \u2192 output 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nSeventh input row: 0 2 0 0 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 0 \u2192 output 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nEighth input row: 2 2 0 0 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 0 \u2192 output 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nNinth input row: 0 0 2 0 \u2192 sum in 2x2 is 0 \u2192 output 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, this rule fits Example", -0.25]]}
