Let me look at the examples provided and see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput Grid:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput Grid:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nHmm, looking at the input and output, I notice that in the first row of the output, the last two elements are 7 and the middle is 6 and 6, which correspond to the last two elements of the second and third rows in the input. The first output element is 6, which seems to be the value from the second row's fourth element. The second output element is 6 again, which matches the fourth row's sixth element. The third output element is 7, which comes from the sixth row's third element.\n\nWait, maybe it's about taking the maximum value in each row. Let me check:\n\nIn the first row of the output, 6 is the maximum of the input's first row. The second row's output is 6, which is the maximum of the second input row. The third output is 7, which is the maximum of the third input row. That seems to fit.\n\nLooking at the second row of the output: 0 5 7. The second input row has a 0, a 0, a 6, and a 6. The maximum is 6, but the output is 5 and 7. Hmm, maybe it's the maximum of the non-zero elements or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the maximum of the elements in the corresponding column. Let me check:\n\nFor columns 1, 2, 3, etc., the output seems to take the maximum from the input.\n\nIn Example 1, the first output is 6, which comes from the input's first row's 6 and 6. The second output is 5, but the input's second row has 0, 0, 5, 0, etc. The maximum in the second column is 6, but the output is 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the maximum of the non-zero elements in each column. Let me count the non-zero elements in each column of the input:\n\nIn the first column, all are zero. Second column: first row is 0, second is 0, third is 0, fourth is 0, fifth is 0, sixth is 6, seventh is 0, eighth is 0, ninth is 0, tenth is 0, eleventh is 0. So non-zero is 6.\n\nSimilarly, second column's maximum is 6.\n\nThird column: first row 0, second row 0, third row 0, fourth row 0, fifth row 0, sixth row 0, seventh row 0, eighth row 0, ninth row 0, tenth row 0, eleventh row 0. All zeros, so maximum is 0.\n\nFourth column: first row 0, second row 0, third row 5, fourth row 4, fifth row 0, sixth row 0, seventh row 0, eighth row 0, ninth row 0, tenth row 0, eleventh row 0. So maximum is 5.\n\nFifth column: similar to fourth, maximum is 5.\n\nSixth column: first row 0, second row 6, third row 0, fourth row 0, fifth row 0, sixth row 0, seventh row 0, eighth row 0, ninth row 0, tenth row 0, eleventh row 0. Maximum is 6.\n\nSeventh column: all zeros.\n\nEighth column: first row 0, second row 6, third row 5, fourth row 0, fifth row 0, sixth row 0, seventh row 0, eighth row 0, ninth row 0, tenth row 0, eleventh row 0. Maximum is 6.\n\nNinth column: all zeros.\n\nTenth column: first row 0, second row 6, third row 5, fourth row 0, fifth row 0, sixth row 0, seventh row 0, eighth row 0, ninth row 0, tenth row 0, eleventh row 0. Maximum is 6.\n\nEleventh column: all zeros.\n\nWait, the output grid's first row is 6 (max from second column), 6 (max from sixth column), and 7 (max from... Wait, perhaps the third output is 7, which would correspond to the third column's maximum, which is 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look at Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nOutput is 3 rows. Let's see:\n\nFirst output row: 6, 2, 2.\n\nLooking at the input, the third row in output is 6, 0, 0, which comes from the second row of the input. The second output row is 7, 5, 7, which corresponds to the fifth row of the input.\n\nThird output row is 3, 3, 3, which comes from the ninth row of the input.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's the maximum of each column. Let's check the input columns:\n\nFirst column: all zeros, max 0.\n\nSecond column: first row 0, second row 0, third row 6, others 0. Max is 6.\n\nThird column: first row 0, second row 0, third row 0, fourth row 0, etc. Max 0.\n\nFourth column: first row 0, second row 0, third row 5, others 0. Max 5.\n\nFifth column: first row 0, second row 0, third row 0, fourth row 7, others 0. Max 7.\n\nSixth column: first row 0, second row 0, third row 0, fourth row 7, fifth row 5, sixth row 7, others 0. Max 7.\n\nSeventh column: all zeros.\n\nEighth column: first row 0, second row 0, third row 0, fourth row 0, fifth row 0, sixth row 0, seventh row 0, eighth row 0, ninth row 0, etc. All zeros. Max 0.\n\nNinth column: all zeros.\n\nTenth column: first row 0, second row 0, third row 0, fourth row 0, fifth row 0, sixth row 0, seventh row 0, eighth row 0, ninth row 0, tenth row 0, eleventh row 0. All zeros. Max 0.\n\nEleventh column: all zeros.\n\nSo if we take the maximum of each column, the output would be:\n\n0 6 0 5 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut the output is 6 2 2; 7 5 7; 3 3 3. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the maximum of the non-zero elements in each column.\n\nIn the input, for each column:\n\nColumn 1: max 0\n\nColumn 2: max 6\n\nColumn 3: max 0\n\nColumn 4: max 5\n\nColumn 5: max 7\n\nColumn 6: max 7\n\nColumn 7: max 0\n\nColumn 8: max 0\n\nColumn 9: max 0\n\nColumn 10: max 0\n\nColumn 11: max 0\n\nSo the output would be 0 6 0 5 7 7 0 0 0 0 0. But the output is 6 2 2; 7 5 7; 3 3 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe it's the maximum of the elements in the row for each column. Let's see:\n\nLooking at each row in the output:\n\nFirst row of output: 6, 2, 2\n\nLooking at the input's third row, which is 0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The maximum is 6, but the output is 6, 2, 2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the maximum of the elements in the row that are non-zero. Let's check:\n\nIn the input, the non-zero elements in the third row are 6 and 6 in columns 2 and 6. So the maximum is 6. But the output is 6, 2, 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum in each column across all rows. Let's check:\n\nColumns:\n\n1: 0\n\n2: 6\n\n3: 0\n\n4: 5\n\n5: 7\n\n6:7\n\n7:0\n\n8:0\n\n9:0\n\n10:0\n\n11:0\n\nSo the max per column is 0,6,0,5,7,7,0,0,0,0,0. But the output is 6 2 2; 7 5 7; 3 3 3. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look at Example 3.\n\nExample 3 Input:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\nSo the output is 3 rows, each with 3 elements.\n\nLooking at the input, the first row of output is 0,1,1. It corresponds to the third row of the input, which is 0,1,1,0,0,... So maybe the output is the third row of the input.\n\nThe second row of output is 1,5,2. Looking at the input, the fourth row is 1,5,0,0,... So maybe it's the fourth row.\n\nThird row of output is 9,9,2. Wait, in the input, the ninth row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. That doesn't match. However, the ninth column's maximum is 9, which might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's taking the maximum of each column across all rows.\n\nInput columns:\n\n1: 0\n\n2:0\n\n3:0\n\n4:0\n\n5:0\n\n6:0\n\n7:0\n\n8:0\n\n9:0\n\n10:0\n\n11:0\n\nColumns 4: the third row has 1, the fourth row has 5, the fourth row of output is 1,5,2. Hmm, maybe it's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of each column. Let's see:\n\nIn the input, each column has 0 except for column 2 and 3, which have 1 each. So the output would be 0,1,1, which matches the first output row.\n\nThe second output row is 1,5,2, which could correspond to the fourth row of the input, which has 1,5,0, etc. So perhaps the output is constructed by taking the non-zero elements in each column and summing them. But in the output, 1,5,2 are the sums of column 2, 4, and 5. But the output is 1,5,2, which matches the fourth row's non-zero elements.\n\nWait, the first output row is 0,1,1. That corresponds to columns 2 and 3. The second output row is 1,5,2. That corresponds to columns 2,4,5. The third output row is 9,9,2. Hmm, 9 is the maximum of column 9 and 10, which have 0s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the maximum of each column, but in the output, the third row has 9,9,2. Maybe it's taking the maximum of each column and then arranging them. Let's see:\n\nColumns:\n\n1:0\n\n2:6 (from example 1, second row)\n\n3:0\n\n4:5 (from example 1, fourth row)\n\n5:7 (from example 1, sixth row)\n\n6:7 (from example 1, sixth row)\n\n7:0\n\n8:0\n\n9:0\n\n10:0\n\n11:0\n\nSo the max per column is 0,6,0,5,7,7,0,0,0,0,0. But the output is 6 2 2; 7 5 7; 3 3 3. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output for the second row is 5 and 7, which are the values from the second row of input. Wait, the second row of input is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0. The output is 6,5,7. So 6 is the maximum of column 1, 5 is the maximum of column 4, 7 is the maximum of column 6. But 6 is from column 1, which is zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's taking the maximum of each row, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the maximum value in each group of rows with the same column. Let me think.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of output is 6, which is the maximum of column 1. The second row is 5, which is the maximum of column 4. The third row is 7, which is the maximum of column 6. That matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the first output row is 6, which is the maximum of column 2. The second output row is 7, which is the maximum of column 6. The third output row is 3, which is the maximum of column 9. That matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the first output row is 0, which is the maximum of column 1. The second output row is 1, which is the maximum of column 2. The third output row is 9, which is the maximum of column 9. That matches.\n\nWait, that seems to fit all examples. Let me test it.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- First column: max is 0 \u2192 output 0, but in the output it's 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no, in Example 1, the first row of output is 6, which is the maximum of column 1. But column 1 in the input is all zeros. So this contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not the maximum of each column, but the maximum of the non-zero elements in each column.\n\nIn Example 1, column 1: 0 \u2192 max is 0, but output is 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's taking the maximum of each row. Let me see.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of output is 6, which is the maximum of the first row's elements. The second row is 5, which is the maximum of the fourth row. The third row is 7, which is the maximum of the sixth row.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's taking the maximum of each column across all rows.\n\nIn Example 1, for column 1: 0 \u2192 max 0.\n\nBut the output is 6, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLet me check Example 3", -0.25], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by carefully examining the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output are quite different. Let's break it down row by row to see if there's a consistent pattern.\n\nFirst, I notice that in the input, there are several rows filled with zeros except for some specific cells. For instance, in the second row of the input, there are six zeros and six non-zero cells. The output row shows six zeros, a 6, and a 7. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nAnother observation is that in the output, some rows have a 7 in the third position, while others don't. This suggests that the number 7 might be significant in the rule.\n\nI also notice that the number of non-zero cells in the rows varies. For example, the first output row has three non-zero cells, while the second has three as well. This might indicate that certain cells are being replaced or modified based on their position in the grid.\n\nLet me look at another example to see if a pattern emerges. In Example 2, the input and output again have varying non-zero cells, but the rule seems to involve replacing zeros with specific numbers based on their position.\n\nWait, I think I'm seeing a pattern here. It seems that the output grid is derived by replacing zeros in each row with a specific number, which might be related to the highest non-zero value in the corresponding column of the input grid. \n\nFor example, in the first output row of Example 1, the non-zero cells are 6 and 7. The highest non-zero value in the corresponding columns must be 7, which is why it appears there. Similarly, in the second output row, the non-zero are 5 and 7, with 7 being the highest in that column.\n\nApplying this to the test input grid provided, I can predict each output row. I just need to identify the highest non-zero value in each column of the input grid and replace zeros with that value if it's present in the corresponding row.\n\nAfter doing this, the predicted output grid should match the expected result based on the observed patterns.\n</think>", -0.25], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns or connections between the input and output cells.\n\nFirst, I'll compare the first example. The input grid has a lot of zeros, except for some specific cells that have numbers like 6, 7, 5, 4, etc. The output grid shows non-zero values in similar positions. It seems like the output isn't entirely dependent on the input cells but rather on some transformation or rule that's consistent across the grid.\n\nLooking at the first example's output:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nI notice that the output grid has the same number of non-zero cells as the input grid. Each row in the output corresponds to a row in the input, but the values within each row seem to be derived from some operation applied to the input cells. \n\nMaybe the rule involves taking values from specific positions in the input grid to form the output. For instance, perhaps each output cell is the sum of certain input cells or some function of them. Let's see:\n\nTake the output row 1: 6, 6, 7. If we look at the input rows, the first row has a lot of zeros, the second row has a 6, 6, and 0, the third row has a 0, 5, 7, the fourth row has 4, 4, 0, and so on. It's a bit hard to see a pattern yet.\n\nAnother approach is to look at how the output values change as we move through the input rows. For example, moving from the second row to the third row in the first example, the output changes from 0,5,7 to 4,4,0. It seems like the values are decreasing, but I'm not sure if that's the rule.\n\nLet's consider the second example to see if the same rule applies. The input grid has some 9s and 6s, and the output has values like 7, 5, and 3. It looks like the rule might relate to the maximum or minimum values in certain rows or columns.\n\nIn the third example, the output values are entirely zeros except for specific cells, which suggests that the rule might involve checking certain positions to determine if a cell should be non-zero or zero.\n\nPutting this together, I think the rule involves taking the maximum or minimum value from certain rows or columns of the input grid to determine the corresponding output cell. For example, in the first example, the output cell (0,0) is 6, which might be the maximum value in some subgrid of the input. Similarly, the output cell (1,1) is 5, which could be the minimum value in another subgrid.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I'll consider how the rule would apply to the second example. If the rule is to take the maximum value in the row, for instance, in the first row of the input, there are zeros except for the last two cells, which are 0 and 9. The maximum would be 9, but the output is 7, which doesn't match. So maybe it's not the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is to take the sum of certain specific cells in the row, like the first and last cells, in the first example, the output row 1 has 6,6,7. The sum of the first and last cells in the input (9, 0, 0) is 9, but the output is 6. So that doesn't add up.\n\nPerhaps it's a combination of factors, like the sum of certain cells divided by the number of non-zero cells. Let's see: in the input row 2, the cells are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0. The sum of the first two cells (0+0) is 0, divided by 2 gives 0, but the output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the position of certain values in the input. For example, in the first example, the cells with 6 are in specific rows and columns, and the output is formed by following some path through the grid.\n\nLooking at the output grid, each row has three cells, and the output grid has three rows. It seems like each output row corresponds to a specific row in the input grid, but with some transformation applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each row of the input grid and place it in the corresponding position in the output grid. Let's check:\n\nIn the first example, the input rows are:\nRow 0: all zeros except possibly the middle.\nRow 1: has 6,6,0.\nRow 2: has 0,5,7.\nRow 3: has 4,4,0.\nRow 4: all zeros.\nRow 5: all zeros.\nRow 6: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (except last two).\nRow 7: has 6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 8: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 9: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 10: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 11: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 12: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 13: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 14: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 15: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 16: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 17: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 18: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 19: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 20: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 21: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 22: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow 23: has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nSo the non-zero rows in the input are rows 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. That's a lot of rows, but the output has only 3 rows. This suggests that the rule might be more about columns than rows.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check the second example's input and output:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nLooking at the output, it has three rows, each with three non-zero cells. Similarly, the input has multiple rows with non-zero cells. So perhaps the rule is that each output cell corresponds to a specific cell in the input, determined by some rule.\n\nIn the second output row, the values are 7,5,7. The input has a 7 in the sixth row, sixth column (row 6, column 6, assuming zero-based indexing). So maybe each output cell is the value of a specific input cell determined by a position rule.\n\nLooking at the output row 1: 6,2,2. The input has a 6 in the third row, second column (row 3, column 1), and 2s in other places. Similarly, output row 2: 7,5,7. Input has 7 in row 6, column 2, and 5 in row 5, column 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each output cell (i,j) is the value of the input cell (i,j) if it meets certain conditions, otherwise zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output cells are determined by taking the maximum value in a certain subgrid of the input.\n\nFor example, in the second example, the output row 1 has 7,5,7. If the rule is to take the maximum value in a 3x3 subgrid centered at (0,0), but that doesn't fit because the input has 6s in row 3, column 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the output row is determined by the maximum value in a 3x3 subgrid that starts at (0,0). Let's check:\n\nThe input from (0,0) to (2,2) is:\n0 0 0\n0 6 0\n0 0 0\n\nThe maximum here is 6, but the output is 7. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value in a 2x2 subgrid. Let's see:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,1):\n0 0\n0 6\n\nMaximum is 6. Output is 7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output could be the sum of certain cells in the input. For example, in output row 1: 6+2+2=10. In input row 3, column 2 is 7, which is higher. Maybe it's the sum of the top-left 3x3 subgrid, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of all non-zero cells in a specific column or row.\n\nLooking at the first output row: 6,2,2. If it's the sum of a column, say column 2, then perhaps each output cell is the sum of a specific column in the input. For example, column 2 in the input has 6 at row 3, and 5 at row 6. Maybe the output is 6+5=11, but the output is 7. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of the maximum values in certain rows or columns.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is derived from the input by looking at the maximum value in each row, but adjusted in a certain way. For example, in the first input row, the maximum is 9, but the output is 6. 9 - 3 = 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the first, second, and third maximum values in a certain subgrid.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's consider that the rule might involve the position of non-zero cells. For example, in the first example, the non-zero cells are at positions (0,4), (0,5), (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5), (7,0), (7,1), (8,2), (9,2), (10,1), (10,2), (11,1), (11,2), (12,1), (12,2), (13,1), (13,2), (14,1), (14,2), (15,1), (15,2), (16,1), (16,2), (17,1), (17,2), (18,1), (18,2), (19,1), (19,2), (20,1), (20,2), (21,1), (21,2), (22,1), (22,2), (23,1), (23,2).\n\nLooking at the output, the first row has 6,6,7. These correspond to cells where the input has 6s. So maybe the rule is to take the values from cells that have 6 and form a certain pattern.\n\nBut this is too time-consuming. I think the best approach is to look for a consistent pattern across all examples.\n\nIn the first example, the output rows are:\n\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nLooking at the output row 1, 6,6,7. The input rows with 6s are rows 1, 2, 7. The output cells correspond to the positions of these 6s.\n\nSimilarly, in the second example, the output row 1 has 7,5,7. The input has 7s in rows 6, 5, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the rule is to take the values from certain rows and columns in the input to form the output row.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the rule is that each output cell (i,j) is the value of the input cell (i,j) if it is the maximum or minimum in a certain subgrid, or perhaps it's determined by the position of the cell.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be that each output row is formed by the maximum values from certain columns.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to say. I think the best approach is to consider that the output row is formed by taking the maximum values from certain columns in the input.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's output row 1: 6,6,7. The input has 6s in row 1, column 2 and row 2, column 1 and column 2. Maybe the rule is that for each output column, take the maximum value from that column across the rows.\n\nBut in the first output column, the maximum is 9 from row 4. But the output is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of certain cells.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I think the best way is to look at the third example and see if the pattern holds.\n\nIn the third example, output row 1 is 0,1,1. The input has 1 in row 2, column 2 and row 5, column 1. So maybe for output cell (i,j), it's the value from input cell (i,j) if it's non-zero, else derived from others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output row is formed by taking the values from certain cells in a specific order.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn the first example, the output seems to have values that are the sum of the first and last non-zero cells in the input row. For example, row 1 has 0,6,6,0. Sum is 12. Output is 6,6,0. Doesn't fit.\n\nIn the second example, the output row 1 has 7,5,7. The input has 7 in row 6 and 5 in row 5. Maybe it's taking the values at certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by the maximum value in each column of the input.\n\nLet me check:\n\nIn the first example, the input has maximum values:\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 9\nRow 2: 9\nRow 3: 9\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 6\nRow 8: 0\nRow 9: 0\nRow 10: 0\nRow 11: 0\nRow 12: 0\nRow 13: 0\nRow 14: 0\nRow 15: 0\nRow 16: 0\nRow 17: 0\nRow 18: 0\nRow 19: 0\nRow 20: 0\nRow 21: 0\nRow 22: 0\nRow 23: 0", -0.25], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So the two 6s in the input are becoming 5 and 7 in the output. But why?\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the values in each column? Let's check.\n\nFor example, the first column in the input has 0 in the first row, and then 0s until the 8th row, which is 0. So the sum is 0, but the output's first element is 6, which doesn't fit. So that can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the maximum value in each column?

So the 4s in the input are becoming 4s in the output, which doesn't change. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's something else. Let me look at the fourth row of the input, which is all zeros except for 7 in the 8th position. The output's fourth row is 0 in the first, 5,7. So 7 in the input becomes 7 in the output. But why is it 5 instead of 6 or something else? Maybe it's the count of how many non-zero numbers are in the row?\n\nLooking at the first row of the input, all zeros. The output's first row has 6,6,7. So maybe it's the position of the non-zero numbers. But the output's first row has three numbers, so maybe each non-zero number in the input contributes to one in the output.

The input's third row is 0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0. So 5s are in the 4th and 8th positions. The output's third row has 4,4,0. So the 5s are becoming 4s, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product of the non-zero elements. In the second row, the two 6s multiply to 36, but the output's second row is 0,5,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the difference between the maximum and minimum in each row. Let's see.\n\nFirst row: all zeros, max and min are 0, so output is 6,6,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nSecond row: two 6s. Max is 6, min is 0. 6-0=6, but output is 5 and 7. Doesn't fit.\n\nThird row: 0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0. Max is 5, min is 0. 5-0=5, but output is 4,4,0. Doesn't fit.\n\nFourth row: all zeros except 7. Max and min are 7, so difference is 0, but output is 0,5,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the digits in each number. For example, in the second row, the two 6s sum to 12, but the output is 5 and 7, which sum to 12. So that might fit. Let me check other rows.\n\nThird row: two 5s sum to 10, output is 4 and 4, which sum to 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nFourth row: 7 is single digit, sum is 7, output is 7, which matches.\n\nFifth row: all zeros, output is 0,0,0.\n\nSixth row: all zeros.\n\nSeventh row: 7 is single digit, output is 7.\n\nEighth row: 5 is single digit, output is 5.\n\nNinth row: 9 is single digit, output is 9.\n\nEleventh row: 0,5,0, etc., which fit the output.\n\nWait, this seems to fit. Let me test this idea.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each cell in the output grid, take the sum of the digits of the corresponding input cell. If the input cell is a single digit, just use it. If it's more than one digit, sum them.\n\nLet me see if this works for all rows.\n\nFirst row of input: all zeros. Output is 6,6,7. Wait, 6+6+7=19, but sum of digits is 0+0+0+... which is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not the sum of digits but the sum of the digits in the non-zero positions. Let me check.\n\nFor the first row, all zeros, so 0+0+0+...+0=0. But the output is 6,6,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the digits in each non-zero cell. Let's see.\n\nFirst row: 6+6+7=19. Output is 6,6,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nSecond row: two 6s, sum is 12. Output is 5 and 7, sum is 12. Fits.\n\nThird row: two 5s, sum is 10. Output is 4 and 4, sum is 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nFourth row: 7, sum is 7. Output is 7. Fits.\n\nFifth row: all zeros, output is 0,0,0.\n\nSixth row: all zeros.\n\nSeventh row: 7, sum is 7. Output is 7. Fits.\n\nEighth row: 5, sum is 5. Output is 5. Fits.\n\nNinth row: 9, sum is 9. Output is 9. Fits.\n\nEleventh row: 0,5,0, etc. 5 is single digit, output is 5. Fits.\n\nNinth row of input is 9, output is 9. That fits.\n\nWait, but in the first row, the sum of digits in the output is 6+6+7=19, but the input has all zeros. So this doesn't fit. Maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to sum the digits of each input cell, but only if the cell is non-zero. So in the first row, all cells are zero, so 0+0+0=0. But the output is 6,6,7, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's something else. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking at the output rows:\n\nFirst output row: 6,6,7.\n\nLooking at the input rows, the 6s are in the second and sixth rows of the input. Wait, but the first output row corresponds to the first three rows of the input.\n\nLet me see the pattern.\n\nInput row 1: All zeros. Output row 1: 6,6,7. So maybe each non-zero cell in the output is the sum of the corresponding input's digits.\n\nBut in row 1, all input cells are zero, so 6+6+7=19, but the output is 6,6,7.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the count of non-zero cells in the output for each row. Let me check.\n\nOutput row 1: 3 numbers, which is the count of non-zero cells in the input for each column.\n\nWait, but in the first input row, all are zeros, so count is 0, but output has 3 numbers. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of non-zero cells in the output for each row. Let me see.\n\nOutput row 1: three numbers, which could correspond to three columns. So maybe each output number is the sum of the digits of the corresponding input cell.\n\nBut for the first row, the output is 6,6,7, which are non-zero, but input is all zeros.\n\nSo I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at another example.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput has 6, 5, 7, etc.\n\nOutput is 6,2,2; 7,5,7; 3,3,3.\n\nSo in the first output row, 6,2,2. The input rows that contribute to these are row 1 (6), row 6 (5), row 7 (7).\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the digits in each column.\n\nLet me check.\n\nFirst column of input: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Output first column:6,0,0. Sum is 6, so maybe each digit in the output is the sum of the digits in the corresponding column.\n\nBut that would mean first output number is sum of column 1, which is 0, but output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the digits in the input multiplied by some factor.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output's first row is 6,2,2. The input's first row has a 6 in the first column. 6 is a single digit, so sum is 6. So output is 6.\n\nSecond output row has 2,2,2. The input's rows with non-zero digits are row 6 (5) and row 7 (7).\n\nSum of digits for 5 is 5, for 7 is 7. So 5 +7 =12. But output is 2,2,2. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's the sum of the non-zero digits divided by something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the digits of the output for each row is the sum of the digits of the input for that row.\n\nWait, in Example 1:\n\nFirst output row: 6,6,7. Sum is 19.\n\nFirst input row: sum is 0. So 19 \u22600.\n\nDoesn't fit.\n\nSecond output row:5,7. Sum is 12.\n\nSecond input row: sum is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThird output row:4,4,0. Sum is 8.\n\nThird input row: sum is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not the sum.\n\nWait, in Example 2:\n\nFirst output row:6,2,2. Sum is 10.\n\nFirst input row:6 in first column, sum is 6. 10\u22606.\n\nSecond output row:7,5,7. Sum is 19.\n\nSecond input row:5 in sixth column, sum is5. 19\u22605.\n\nThird output row:3,3,3. Sum is9.\n\nThird input row:7 in seventh column, sum is7. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the digits of the output is equal to the sum of the digits of the input multiplied by some factor.\n\nIn Example 1, first output row sum 19, input sum 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nSecond output row sum 12, input sum 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThird output row sum 8, input sum 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: maybe it's the sum of the digits of the output is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the input multiplied by some factor.\n\nFirst output row:3 elements, sum 19. Input has 3 non-zero elements (6,6,7). 3*6=18. 19\u226018.\n\nSecond output row:3 elements, sum19. Input has 2 non-zero elements (5,7). 2*9.5=19. But 9.5 isn't an integer. Doesn't fit.\n\nThird output row:3 elements, sum8. Input has 1 non-zero element (9). 9*0.9=8. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's the product of the count of non-zero digits.\n\nFirst output row:3 digits, count 3, product is 3*3*3=27. No relation.\n\nSecond output row:2,2,2. Product is 8.\n\nThird output row:3,3,3. Product is27.\n\nNot related.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the digits in the output is equal to the sum of the digits in the input multiplied by some number.\n\nBut in Example 1:\n\nFirst input row sum:0. Output sum:19. Doesn't fit.\n\nSecond input row sum:0. Output sum:12. Doesn't fit.\n\nThird input row sum:0. Output sum:8. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of the input's digits for each column. Let's test.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nFirst output row:6,6,7. Sum is19.\n\nFirst input row:0. 19\u22600.\n\nSecond output row:5,7. Sum is12.\n\nSecond input row:0. 12\u22600.\n\nThird output row:4,4,0. Sum is8.\n\nThird input row:0. 8\u22600.\n\nDoesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the input's digits for each column multiplied by some factor.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nFirst input row sum:0.\n\nOutput sum:19.\n\nSecond input row sum:0.\n\nOutput sum:12.\n\nThird input row sum:0.\n\nOutput sum:8.\n\nSo 19,12,8. How are these related? Maybe 19,12,8 are multiples of 3, but 19 isn't a multiple of3.\n\nAlternatively, 19-12=7, 12-8=4. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the digits in the output is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the input multiplied by some number.\n\nFirst output row:3 elements. Input has3 non-zero elements. 3*something=19. Doesn't fit.\n\nSecond output row:3 elements. Input has2 non-zero elements. 2*something=12. 12/2=6. Maybe each non-zero element is 6. Let's check.\n\nInput row 6:5. Output row6:2. 5 in input, 2 in output. 5\u21922. Maybe sum of digits is6, but 5 is single digit.\n\nAlternatively, 5-3=2. 3 is the number of non-zero elements in input row2.\n\nWait, let's see: input row2 has two non-zero elements (6,6). So 6-3=3, but output is 2.\n\nWait, 6 in input row2 is single digit, so 6-4=2. 4 is the number of non-zero elements.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of non-zero elements in the input multiplied by something.\n\nIn row2: 2 non-zero elements. Output row2:2,2,2. Sum is6.\n\n6 divided by2 is3. So each output element is3.\n\nWait, but 3 is the number of non-zero elements in row2.\n\nWait, row2 has two non-zero elements (6,6), output has three elements (2,2,2). So each element is3.\n\nBut 6 is in input, 3 is output. So maybe it's adding 3 or something.\n\nBut 6+3=9, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of non-zero elements multiplied by the digit sum.\n\nIn row2: 2 elements, digit sum 12 (6+6). 2*12=24. Output sum is6.\n\nNo relation.\n\nWait, maybe it's the digit sum of the output is equal to the digit sum of the input multiplied by some factor.\n\nIn row1: input digit sum is0, output digit sum is19. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow2: input digit sum is12, output digit sum is6. 6=12*(0.5).\n\nRow3: input digit sum is9, output digit sum is3. 3=9*(1/3).\n\nHmm, so factors are 0.5 and 1/3. Not consistent.\n\nWait, maybe it's the digit sum multiplied by the number of", -0.25], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are three examples provided, and I need to figure out what rule applies to all of them. Let me start by carefully analyzing each example step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at Example 1. The input grid is a 12x12 matrix filled mostly with zeros, except for some rows and columns where there are numbers. The output grid seems to be a 3x12 matrix with the numbers arranged differently. \n\nLooking at the input:\n- The first row is all zeros.\n- The second row has a 6 in the 6th and 7th positions.\n- The third row has a 5 in the 5th and 8th positions.\n- The fourth row has a 4 in the 4th and 6th positions.\n- The fifth row is all zeros.\n- The sixth row is all zeros.\n- The seventh row has a 7 in the 7th position.\n- The eighth row has a 9 in the 10th, 11th, and 12th positions.\n- The ninth row has a 5 in the 8th position.\n- The tenth row is all zeros.\n- The eleventh row has a 7 in the 6th, 7th, and 8th positions.\n- The twelfth row is all zeros.\n\nThe output grid is:\n- First row: 6, 6, 7\n- Second row: 0, 5, 7\n- Third row: 4, 4, 0\n\nHmm, so in the output, the numbers that were originally non-zero in the input are now appearing in different positions. For example, the 6 in the second row of input becomes the first element of the first row in output, and so on. It seems like the rule involves taking the maximum value in certain regions of the input grid.\n\nLooking deeper, in the output, the first row has two 6s and a 7. These might correspond to the maximum values in specific columns of the input. Similarly, the second row has a 5, and the third row has a 4. It might be that we're taking the maximum value from columns 2, 3, and 6, respectively.\n\nWait, let me check. In the first row of input, all are zeros except columns 6 and 7, which have 6. In the output, the first element is 6. That makes sense as the maximum. In the fourth row of input, in columns 4 and 6, we have 4, so in the output, the second element is 4. That fits.\n\nFor columns 5, the input has 5 in the second and ninth rows. In the output, the third element of the second row is 5. So it's taking the value from column 5 of those rows.\n\nWhat about the 7s? In the second and ninth rows, column 7 has a 7, which becomes the third element in the output. That fits too.\n\nThe 9 in the input's last row becomes the third element in the last row of the output, which is 9. So it's the maximum of that column.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: for each output row, take the maximum value from the corresponding columns in the input row, but only considering certain columns. Wait, but in the output, the rows have different numbers of elements, so it's not straightforward.\n\nWait, let me look at Example 2. The input grid has some zeros and a 9 in the last row. The output has 9, 7, and 3 in the first three rows.\n\nLooking at the input, the 9 in the last row becomes the first element of the first row of output. The 7 in the same row becomes the second element of the second row. The 3 becomes the third element of the third row. So it's taking the value from the last row of the input.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in Example 1, the 9 in the last row of the input was used in all output rows, but the 7 and 9 in the input were used in different rows. Hmm, that suggests that the rule varies between examples.\n\nWait, let me check Example 3. The input has a 9 in the last row, but the output seems to have 9, 7, and 2 in the first three rows. The 9 in the input's last row is used in all output rows, but the 7 and 9 are used differently.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the rule might not be based on a fixed example. Perhaps the rule depends on the specific input to each example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in certain columns, but the selection of columns varies.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to find the maximum value in each column of the input and place it in the corresponding position in the output. Let me test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the maximum values in each column would be:\n- Column 1: 0\n- Column 2: 0\n- Column 3: 0\n- Column 4: 0\n- Column 5: 0\n- Column 6: 6\n- Column 7: 9\n- Column 8: 9\n- Column 9: 0\n- Column 10: 7\n- Column 11: 0\n- Column 12: 0\n\nBut the output grid doesn't match this. For instance, the first output row has 6, 6, 7, which doesn't correspond to the maximum of any column. So that can't be the rule.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in the columns 2, 3, 6, 7, etc., but that needs to be determined based on the examples.\n\nLooking back at Example 1, the non-zero entries in the input are:\n- (2,6) and (2,7) with 6.\n- (3,5) and (3,8) with 5.\n- (4,4) and (4,6) with 4.\n- (8,10), (8,11), (8,12) with 9.\n- (11,6), (11,7), (11,8) with 7.\n- (12,0) with 2.\n\nIn the output, the first row is 6,6,7. So 6 comes from column 6 and 7 of the first input row, but the output row is 6 in the first and second columns, and 7 in the third.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in the columns 6 and 7 for the first row, maximum in columns 5 and 8 for the second row, and maximum in columns 4,6 for the third row.\n\nWait, but in the input, column 4 has 4 in the fourth row, but in the output, the second row has 4 in the fourth position. Similarly, column 6 has 6,5,4, etc., but in the output, it's 6,5,7.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in each column across all rows, but that doesn't fit because in the output, the rows have varying numbers of elements, and the maximums would be spread across multiple columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's taking the maximum value in each diagonal of the input grid. For example, in the first row, the maximum along the main diagonal would be the value at (1,1), which is 0. But in the output, the first element is 6, so that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in each column of the input grid, but then map those maximum values to the output grid in a specific way. In Example 1, the maximum values are in columns 6,7,5,4,10,11,12,8,9,6,7,8. The output has the first row as 6,6,7, which seems like taking the maximum values from columns 6,7,8.\n\nWait, but in the input, column 8 has 9 in the last row, which is also the maximum. So perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each column, and then for each output row, take the maximum from the corresponding set of columns.\n\nBut how do the output rows correspond to the input rows? For example, the first output row has 6,6,7, which are the maximums from columns 6,7,8. The second output row has 0,5,7, which are the maximums from columns 5,8, and 8. Hmm, that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in each column, but only for certain rows. In Example 1, the first output row has 6,6,7, which could be the maximum from columns 6,7, and 8. The second row has 0,5,7, which are from columns 5,8, and 8 again. The third row has 4,4,0, which might be from columns 4,6, and 8.\n\nBut how does this correspond to the input rows? For example, the first output row has 6,6,7, which would correspond to the maximum values from columns 6,7, and 8. But in the input, column 6 has 6 in row 2,5,7, and column 7 has 6 in rows 2,11. So the maximum in column 6 is 6, and in column 7 is 9, but in the output, it's 6,6,7. Hmm, this doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's taking the maximum value in certain rows for each column. For example, in each column, the maximum value across all rows is taken, but then these maximums are placed in the output grid in a specific way.\n\nIn Example 1, the maximum values per column would be:\n- Column 1: 0\n- Column 2: 0\n- Column 3: 0\n- Column 4: 0\n- Column 5: 0\n- Column 6: 6\n- Column 7: 9\n- Column 8: 9\n- Column 9: 0\n- Column 10: 7\n- Column 11: 0\n- Column 12: 0\n\nThen, the output grid is constructed by taking these maximums in a specific order. For example, the first row of output is 6,6,7, which could be the maximums from column 6,7, and 8. But in the input, column 8 has 9, which is the overall maximum, so why is it placed in the third position of the first output row?\n\nThis suggests that the rule isn't simply taking the maximum of each column, because the 9 in column 8 would be in all output rows, but in Example 1, the output third row has 9 in the third position, which is from column 7, not column 8.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in each column, but then arrange them in a specific order that follows the output rows. For example, in the first output row, the maximums from column 6,7, and 8 are 6,6,7. In the second output row, perhaps from column 5,8, and 8 again, but that doesn't align with the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each diagonal. For example, the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) would have maximums in each position, but that might not fit the examples.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to find the maximum value in each column, but only for certain rows. For instance, in Example 1, the first row of output is 6,6,7, which could be the maximums from columns 2,3, and 4 across all rows. But that doesn't make sense because column 2 has 0s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's taking the maximum value in each column and then placing it in the output grid's rows in a specific order. For example, in the first output row, the maximum value in column 6 is 6, in column 7 is 9, and in column 8 is 9. So 6,9,9, but the output row is 6,6,7. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in each column, but then map them to the output grid's rows in a way that follows the order of the output rows. For example, the first output row takes the maximums from column 1, column 2, and column 3, but that's all zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each column, but then arrange them in the output grid's rows in a way that follows the order of the input rows. For example, the first output row takes the maximums from column 2, 3, and 4, but again, this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at Example 2 to see if the rule is consistent across examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 9 in the last row, which is the maximum of that column. The output has 9 in the first row, but the rule isn't clear yet.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the first output row is 6,2,2. The maximum in each column would be 6,7,9. But the output isn't matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in each column, but then place those maximums in the output grid's rows in a way that follows the order of the output rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the maximum values are in columns 6,7,8, with 6,9,9. The output rows are 6,6,7; 0,5,7; 4,4,0.\n\nWait, if I take the maximum values from columns 6,7,8 for each row:\n\n- First row: 6,9,9 \u2192 but output is 6,6,7. So that doesn't match.\n- Second row: 6,9,9 \u2192 output is 0,5,7. So again, no match.\n- Third row: 6,9,9 \u2192 output is 4,4,0. No match.\n\nSo that can't be the rule.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximum value in each column, but then place them in the output grid's rows in a way that follows the order of the input rows. For example, the first output row takes the maximums from column 2, 3, and 4, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each column, but then arrange them in the output grid's rows in a way that follows the order of the input rows, but only taking the maximums from certain columns.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps the rule involves looking at the sum of certain values in each row or column and then applying a transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to find the maximum value in each column and then place them in the output grid's rows in a specific order, perhaps in the order of the input rows.\n\nWait, let's consider that. In Example 1, the maximum values in each column are:\n\n- Column 1: 0\n- Column 2: 0\n- Column 3: 0\n- Column 4: 0\n- Column 5: 0\n- Column 6: 6\n- Column 7: 9\n- Column 8: 9\n- Column 9: 0\n- Column 10: 7\n- Column 11: 0\n- Column 12: 0\n\nNow, if we arrange these maximums in the order of the input rows, we'd have:\n\nRow 1: 6,9\nRow 2: 6,9\nRow 3: 0,0\nRow 4: 0,0\nRow 5: 0,0\nRow 6: 0,0\nRow 7:6,9\nRow 8:9,9\nRow9:0,0\nRow10:0,0\nRow11:0,0\nRow12:0,0\n\nBut the output grid doesn't match this. For example, the first output row is 6,6,7. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum value in each column, but then assign them to the output grid's rows in a specific way, perhaps by columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to find the maximum value in each row of the input grid and place them in the output grid's columns.\n\nIn Example 1, the maximum values in each row are:\n\n- Row 1: 0\n- Row 2: 6\n- Row 3:9\n- Row 4:9\n- Row 5:0\n- Row 6:0\n- Row7:7\n- Row8:9\n- Row9:9\n- Row10:7\n- Row11:0\n- Row12:0\n\nThen, the output grid would have these maximum values spread across the columns. But the output grid in Example 1 is 6,6,7 in the first row, which doesn't match this.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look at Example 3 to see if the rule is consistent.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 9 in the last row, which is the maximum. The output has 9,7,2 in the first three rows. The rule seems similar to the previous examples, but with different numbers.\n\nIf I try to find the maximums in each column of the input:\n\n- Column 1: 0\n- Column 2: 0\n- Column 3: 0\n- Column4: 0\n- Column5: 0\n- Column6:0\n- Column7:0\n- Column8:0\n- Column9:0\n- Column10:9\n- Column11:9\n- Column12:0\n\nSo the maximums are in column10 and 11. Then, the output grid is:\n\n- First row:0,1,1\n- Second row:1,5,2\n- Third row:9,9,2\n\nHmm, that doesn't directly match the maximums. So perhaps the rule is not to take the maximums of the entire grid.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the maximums along certain diagonals. For example, the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) has maximums in each position, but again, that doesn't fit the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

Let me start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and a few 6s and 5s. The output grid has 6s, 5s, and a 7. It looks like certain numbers are being replaced or modified based on their positions or some operation. \n\nLooking at the positions, I notice that the first number in the output is 6, which appears in the second row of the second column, but in the input, that position is 0. Maybe it's not directly related to the position.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the numbers are being replaced by the largest number in their neighborhood. Let me check that. For instance, in the input, the number 6 is in the second row, second column. The largest number around it seems to be 6 in the input. Wait, no, the input has 6s in the second and fourth columns, but the output is 6, 5, and 7. Maybe it's not the largest, but something else.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a 6 in the second row, fourth column, and another 6 in the second row, sixth column. The output has 6, 5, and 7. Hmm, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 5s and 7. But that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nLet's look at another example. In Example 2, the input has a 0 in the first row, second column, but the output has 6, 2, and 2. Maybe the 0s are being replaced by specific numbers based on their surroundings.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the numbers are being transformed by subtracting the minimum value in the row or column. Or maybe they're being replaced by the sum or product of their neighbors.\n\nLooking at the first output row: 6, 5, 7. The input row has zeros except for a few numbers. Maybe it's based on some operation involving the non-zero numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the positions of 9s. In Example 1, the fourth row (0-based?) has a 9, which in the output is replaced by 7. The fifth row has a 9 as well. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output row starts with 6, 5, 7. Maybe it's the sum of certain elements. Let's see: 6 + 5 + 7 equals 18, but I don't know the sum of any row in the input.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the numbers are being replaced by their values if they meet certain conditions, like being a multiple of a certain number.\n\nLooking at the output, the first output row is 6, 5, 7. The second row is 4, 4, 0, which are all multiples of 4. The third row is 4, 4, 0. Wait, that doesn't align with the input.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output row after 6,2,2 is 7,5,7. So perhaps each row in the output is determined by some function of the corresponding row in the input.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace each non-zero number with the maximum number in its row or column, but that doesn't fit the first example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the positions of 9s. In Example 1, the input has a 9 in the fourth row, which in the output is 7. Similarly, in the fifth row of Example 1, the output is 7, but the input is 9 as well. Wait, the output has 7, 7, 3 for the third row. Hmm, not obvious.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input has 9s in the fourth row and elsewhere, and the output has 9s as well. Maybe the rule is that any 9 in the input is replaced by 9 in the output. But in Example 1, the input has 6s and 5s, and the output has 6, 5, 7. So maybe it's not just replacing 9s.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the numbers are being replaced by their values if they are in certain positions relative to 9s. For example, if a number is greater than 9, it's replaced by 9. But in Example 1, the output has 6, 5, 7, so maybe it's not that.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the digits of the numbers. For example, in Example 1, the input has 6 and 5, which sum to 11, but the output is 6, 5, 7. Doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the position of the 0s. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 10 zeros, the second row has 5 zeros, etc. But the output has 6,5,7, which don't directly relate to the number of zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps it's based on the position of the non-zero numbers. For example, in the output, the first row has 6, which appears in the second row of the input. Maybe it's the value of the non-zero number divided by the row index or something. But this is getting speculative.\n\nI think I need to approach this systematically. Let's take a specific input and see what the output is. For example, take the first row of Example 1:\n\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 6 6 7\n\nWait, that's not possible because the input row is all zeros. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the mapping. Perhaps the output grid is determined by some function of the input grid, such as matrix transformations or element-wise operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each element in the output is the maximum value in its row or column. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the first output row is 6,6,7. Maybe these are the max values in each row. Let's see: the first row of input is all zeros, so the max would be 0, but the output starts with 6. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the minimum value in each row. But the first row's output is 6, which is higher than the min of the input (which is 0). Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps it's the number of non-zero elements in the row. In Example 1, the first row has 10 zeros, so maybe 10 non-zero? But the output is 6,5,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the number of non-zero elements in the column. For example, in the first output row, 6 is in the second column. Maybe it's the count of non-zero elements in that position, but that's confusing.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output rows. For Example 1:\n\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nThe first row has 6,6,7. The second row has 0,5,7. The third row has 4,4,0. \n\nLooking at the input rows, the first row is all zeros. The second row has 0s except for some numbers, and the output row has 6s, 5, and 7. Maybe it's based on the position of 9s in the input. For example, if a 9 is found, it's replaced by 9 in the output.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the fourth row has a 9. In the output, this 9 becomes 7. Similarly, the fifth row has a 9, which becomes 7. The sixth row has a 9 in the seventh column, which becomes 3? Wait, no, the output for the sixth row is 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, so no 9s there. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output rows are 6,2,2; 7,5,7; 3,3,3. Maybe it's based on some kind of position-based transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each row in the output is determined by the sum of certain elements in the corresponding row of the input, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's about the number of digits. For example, 6 has one digit, 5 has one digit, 7 has one digit. But that doesn't explain the transformation.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the position of the 9s. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the output has 6,5,7. Maybe the 9s are replaced by their row index or something. But the output rows don't directly relate to the input rows.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for another approach. Let's consider that the rule could involve a transformation function applied to each element based on their position or some other property.\n\nFor example, perhaps each element is replaced by 9 if it's greater than 9, otherwise by the element itself. But in Example 1, the output has 6,5,7, which are all less than 9, but the input has 6s, 5s, and 9s.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output rows have 6,5,7. Maybe it's the sum of the digits of the input. For example, 6 is 6, 5 is 5, 7 is 7. But in that case, how does that translate to the output grid?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the maximum value in each row of the input, except for 9s which are replaced by 9.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first row of input is all zeros, so the maximum is 0, but the output is 6,6,7. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is based on the number of times a certain digit appears in the input row. For example, the digit 9 appears once in the second row, so it's replaced by 9. But the output is 6,5,7, which don't directly relate to the counts.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output row is 6,2,2. Maybe it's based on the counts of 6s and 2s in the input row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a combination of rows and columns. For example, the element at (i,j) is replaced by the maximum of input[i][j] and input[j][i]. But without seeing the exact mapping, it's hard to confirm.\n\nI think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's assume that each element in the output is the maximum value between itself and the element in its row or column. For example, if an element is greater than the maximum in its row or column, it remains the same; otherwise, it becomes the maximum of the row or column.\n\nIn Example 1, the output rows are 6,6,7; 0,5,7; 4,4,0. If I consider the first element of the output as 6, which is higher than the maximum in its row (which is 0), perhaps it's taking the maximum between itself and the maximum of the row. But the second row's output is 0,5,7, which doesn't fit this logic.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the rule is that each element is replaced by the value in its row if it's greater than the current value; otherwise, it's replaced by the current value. But this seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a transformation where each element is replaced by the sum of the digits of its position. For example, the position (i,j) is converted to i+j, and the sum is taken as the replacement value. But in Example 1, the output rows don't match this.\n\nI'm going in circles. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the rule is that each element in the output is the minimum value between itself and the element in the same row or column that has the maximum value in that row or column. \n\nFor example, in the first row of Example 1, all elements are zeros, so the output would stay zeros. But the output is 6,6,7, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the maximum value in the entire grid. But the output rows don't show that.\n\nAnother thought: maybe it's based on the number of non-zero elements in the row or column. For example, if a row has more non-zero elements, it's replaced by higher numbers.\n\nBut again, the output rows don't directly relate to that.\n\nI think I need to make a logical guess based on the examples. Let's consider that the rule is to replace each non-zero element in the output that is in the same position as a non-zero element in the input with the value of that non-zero element, but only if the value is greater than a certain threshold, say 5.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output row is 6,6,7. Maybe the non-zero elements are replaced if they are greater than 5. So, 6 and 7 are replaced by themselves, but 5 is less than 5? Wait, 5 is exactly 5, not greater than, so maybe it's replaced.\n\nBut in the output, 6,5,7, the 5 is replaced by 5, but perhaps the rule is to replace with 5 if it's in a certain position.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. I think I need to give up and look for a pattern based on the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first output row is 6,6,7. The input has 6s in the second and fourth columns, and a 9 in the fourth row. The output has 6,6,7, which suggests that non-zero elements are being replaced by their value if they meet certain conditions.\n\nMaybe the rule is that each non-zero element is replaced by itself if it's greater than 5, otherwise replaced by 5. Let's test this:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 6 and 9. 6 is greater than 5, so it remains 6. 9 is greater than 5, so it remains 9. But the output has 7, which isn't 9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe non-zero elements are replaced by their position-based values. For example, the first non-zero element in the row gets replaced by 1, the second by 2, etc. But that doesn't align with the examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rule involves the sum of the digits of the row and column indices. For example, the element at (i,j) is replaced by (i+j). But in Example 1, the output rows don't match.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look at the examples again and try to find a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nLooking at the first row of output, 6,6,7. Maybe these are the sum of certain elements in the input. But I don't see an obvious pattern.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each row in the output is derived from the corresponding row in the input by replacing each non-zero element with the sum of the elements in its row. But in Example 1, the row sums are varying, and the output rows don't match.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output's first row has 6,6,7. Maybe these are the number of non-zero elements in each column of the input. Let's see: the input has 6s in columns 6 and 7, and a 9 in the fourth row of column 6. Wait, no, the input in the second row has 6s in columns 6 and 7, and a 9 in the fourth row of column 6. So, in column 6, there are two 6s and one 9, totaling three non-zero elements. Similarly, in column 7, there are two 6s. So the output row would be 3,2,0. But the output is 6,6,7, which doesn't fit.\n\nI'm not making progress. Let me try to think of another pattern. Maybe the rule is that each element is replaced by the value of the element in its row if it's greater than a certain value, otherwise by the value in its column.\n\nFor example, if an element is greater than 5, it remains; otherwise, it's replaced by the value in its column. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the second row has two 6s and a 9. The 6s are greater than 5, so they stay as 6. The 9 is greater than 5, so it stays as 9.

Let me look at the examples one by one and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nHmm, so the output seems to take groups of three elements and transform them. Let me focus on the first row of the input and see what happens in the output.\n\nIn the first row of the input, all are zeros except the 7th and 8th elements which are 6 and 6. The corresponding output row is 6,6,7. So it looks like each element in the output row is the value from the input row, but maybe there's a transformation.\n\nWait, in the third row of the output, the first element is 4, the second is 4, and the third is 0. Looking back, the third input row has a 4 in the first position and 5 in the second, followed by zeros. The output has another 4 and 4, which might suggest that the non-zero elements are preserved, but zeros are replaced with something.\n\nSimilarly, in the second output row, the first element is 0, the second is 5, and the third is 7. The input has a 0, 0, 0, then 0,0,0, 0,0,0, then 0,0,0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0,5,7,0,0,0,0. So it seems that some elements are replaced with others based on their position or value.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the positions of the non-zero elements. For example, in the output, the positions where the input has non-zero values remain, and zeros are replaced with zeros. But in the third row, the output has 4,4,0. So perhaps the middle element is being replaced with the value from the position above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each element in the output is the value from the input, but if it's zero, it's replaced with the value from the position above. But that seems a bit too simplistic.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nHere, the output seems to have 6,2,2 in the first row. The input's fourth row has a 6 in the second position. Maybe the rule is that each non-zero element in the input is carried over to the output, but zeros are replaced with zeros. Wait, but the output has 6,2,2. So perhaps the rule is that each zero in the input is replaced with the value from the input's previous position. For example, in the second output row, the first element is 6 from the third input row, but the third row's input is 0,6,0,0... So maybe it's about the diagonal elements or some other alignment.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\nIn the first output row, the input has 1,1; the output is 0,1,1. Wait, maybe the rule is that for every three elements, the first is zero, the second and third are the non-zero values. But looking at the output, it's 0,1,1. So perhaps the middle element is being carried over, but zeros are replaced with zeros.\n\nWait, in the first output row, the first element is 0, the second and third are 1,1. The input has 0,1,1, then 1,5,0,0,0,0, etc. So maybe the rule is that for each group of three, the first element is set to zero, and the next two are taken from the input. But in the output, the first element is 0, the second and third are 1,1. So that fits.\n\nIn the second output row, the input is 0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0. The output is 1,5,2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that in each group of three, the first element is zero, the second and third are the same as in the input's corresponding position. But in Example 3, the input has, for the third row, 0,1,1,0,0,0,... and the output is 0,1,1. That fits.\n\nWait, let me try to see if the rule is that for each group of three, the first is zero, and the second and third are either taken from the input or zero based on something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each zero in the input is turned into the value from the input's previous position. For example, in Output 1, the first element is 6, which comes from the third input row's second element, which is 6. Then the second element is 6, which comes from the third input row's third element. The third element is 7, which comes from the third input row's eighth or ninth element.\n\nWait, in the first output row, the input has 0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0. So the output is 6,6,7. So the first 6 comes from the third input row's second element, which is 6; the second 6 comes from the third input row's third element, which is 6; the third element is 7, which comes from the third input row's eighth element, which is 7.\n\nSimilarly, in the second output row, the output is 0,5,7. The input has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0. So the first 0 comes from the third input row's fourth element, which is 0; the second 5 comes from the third input row's fifth element, which is 5; the third 7 comes from the third input row's ninth element, which is 7.\n\nWait, that seems to fit. So the rule is that for each group of three elements, the first element is set to zero, and the second and third are taken from the corresponding positions in the input's third row. But that seems too simplistic because the output's second element is always 7, which is in the first input's third row.\n\nWait, no, in the first output row, the third element is 7, which is from the input's third row's eighth element, which is 7. But in the second output row, the third element is 7 as well, which is from the input's third row's ninth element.\n\nWait, but the third input row's ninth element is 0, so why is it 7? That doesn't fit. So perhaps the rule isn't that.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each group of three, the first element is zero, and the second and third are taken from the input's third row, but only if they exist. If not, perhaps they are zero.\n\nBut in Example 3, the third input row is 0,1,1,0,0,0,... and the output is 0,1,1, which matches. Similarly, in Example 1, the third input row's third and fourth elements are 5 and 0, but the output shows 4 and 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each group of three, the first element is zero, and the second and third are taken from the input's third row, but only if they are non-zero. Wait, in the first output row of Example 1, the second element is 6, which is from the input's third row's second element, which is 6. The third element is 7, which is from the input's third row's third element, which is 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the first element is zero, and the second and third are taken from the input's third row, but only if the corresponding positions in the input's third row are non-zero. If they are zero, perhaps they are zero in the output.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the third input row has 0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0. The output is 6,6,7. So the first 6 comes from the third input row's second element, which is 6; the second 6 comes from the third input row's third element, which is 6; the third element is 7, which comes from the third input row's eighth element, which is 6. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a pattern based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nFirst row: 6,6,7\nSecond row: 0,5,7\nThird row: 4,4,0\n\nIn the first row input, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth elements are 0,0,0,0,6,6. The output is 6,6,7. So perhaps the rule is that for every group of three elements, the first is zero, and the second and third are the values from the input's third row's corresponding position. But in the first row of the output, the first element is 6, which comes from the input's third row's second element (6), the second element is 6 from the third row's third element (6), and the third element is 7, which seems to come from the third row's eighth element (6), but that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the first element of the output is zero, and the other two are taken from the input's third row's corresponding positions. So in Example 1, the first output row's second element (6) comes from the input's third row's second element (6), the second element (6) comes from the third row's third element (6), and the third element (7) comes from the third row's eighth element (6) plus 1? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the first element is zero, and the other two are either taken from the input's third row's corresponding position or zero if it's zero in the input. So in Example 1, the input's third row's second and third elements are 6 and 6, so the output's first two elements are 6,6. The third element is 6 plus 1, which is 7. That doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2, the input's third row is all zeros except for the third element, which is 0. The output's first element is 6, which comes from the input's third row's second element (6) and the input's third row's sixth element (0). So the output's third element is 7, which comes from the input's third row's seventh element (7) and the input's third row's ninth element (0). So perhaps the rule is that for each group of three, the first element is zero, and the second and third are taken from the input's third row's corresponding positions.\n\nIn Example 3, the input's third row is 0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The output is 0,1,1. So the first element is zero, the second is 1 from the input's third row's second element (1), and the third is 1 from the input's third row's third element (1). That fits.\n\nWait, so maybe the rule is:\n\nFor each group of three elements in the input, the first element of the output is zero, the second is the value from the input's third row's corresponding second position, and the third is the value from the input's third row's corresponding third position.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1.\n\nInput's third row: 0,0,0,0,6,6.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nFirst group: 0,0,0 \u2192 0,0,0\nSecond group: 0,0,0 \u2192 0,0,0\nThird group: 6,6,0 \u2192 0,6,6\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 6 6\n\nBut the Example 1's output is:\n\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nHmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps my assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each group of three, the first element is zero, and the other two are the non-zero values from the input's third row's corresponding positions. So in Example 1, the third row's second and third elements are 6 and 6, so the output's second and third elements are 6 and 6. But in the output, the first element is 6, which comes from the input's third row's second element (6) and the input's third row's third element (6), but the first element of the output is 0, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each group of three is transformed by taking the non-zero values from the input's third row and placing them in the output, but zeros are replaced with zeros. But in Example 1, the output's first element is 6, which comes from the input's third row's second element (6), but the output's first group has 6,6,7, which doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each group of three is transformed by taking the non-zero values from the input's third row and setting the first element to zero, the second to the value from the second element, and the third to the value from the third element. But in Example 1, that would give 0,6,6 for the first group, but the output is 6,6,7, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me look again.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's third row is 0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0. The output for the first group is 6,6,7. So the first 6 comes from the input's third row's second element (6), the second 6 comes from the third element (6), and the third element is 7, which must come from the input's third row's eighth element (6) plus 1. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that for each group of three, the first element is zero, and the other two are the non-zero values from the input's third row's corresponding positions, but if the value is zero in the input, it remains zero in the output.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input's third row's third element is 6, so the output's third element should be 6, but in the output, it's 7. That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each group of three is transformed by taking the non-zero values from the input's third row and shifting them. For example, in the first output row, the first 6 comes from the input's third row's second element, the second 6 from the third element, and the third 7 from the input's third row's third element plus 1.

Maybe each element in the output is related to the number of occurrences of a specific value in the input row or column.\n\nLooking at the second row of input:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n```\nIt has 2 non-zero elements (6 and 6), so perhaps the output row is 6 6 7, which could mean each 6 in the input contributes to a 6 in the output, and the 7 comes from some other consideration.\n\nFor the third row of input:\n```\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n```\nThis has two 5s, so the output row is 4 4 0, which might mean each 5 contributes to a 4 in the output, and the 0 comes from another value.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 5 would contribute more than 4. Maybe it's the opposite\u2014each 5 in the input corresponds to 4 in the output. Let me check the first row of output: 6 6 7. So, the non-zero elements are 6, 6, and 7. That doesn't fit a simple ratio.\n\nMaybe it's based on the maximum value in each group. For example, in the second row, there are two 6s, so 6 is the maximum, and each 6 contributes to the output. The third row has two 5s, so 5 is the maximum, and each 5 contributes to the output. The first row has 6 and 7, so 7 is the maximum, contributing to the output.\n\nBut looking back at the first row of the output: 6 6 7. If the maximum is 7, then 6 and 7 would be the contributions. The second row's maximum is 6, so 6 contributes. The third row's maximum is 5, so 4 and 0, but 5 would contribute 4, so maybe each 5 is replaced by 4, and the 7 remains as 7.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the first output row. Maybe it's not about the maximum but something else.\n\nLet me look at the second example to see if a pattern holds.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput Grid:\n```\n```\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n```\nLooking at the second row of the input:\n```\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\nIt has one 6, so the output is 6 2 2. Maybe each 6 contributes to 6, and the 2s could be from another value. The third row of the input has 5 and 7, so the output for that row is 3 3 3, which is 7 and 5 contributing to 3. Maybe it's the sum or some operation.\n\nWait, the output rows have 3 elements, while the input rows have varying lengths. Maybe it's based on the maximum value in each row, column, or subgrid.\n\nLooking at the third example:\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput Grid:\n```\n```\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n```\nRows of the output grid have 3 elements. The first row of output is 0 1 1, the second is 1 5 2, and the third is 9 9 2.\n\nLooking at the input rows, the third row has a 1 and two 1s, so maybe the output row is 1 1 1, but in the output, it's 0 1 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, in the third row of output, the first element is 0, which corresponds to the input row having 0s. Maybe it's the minimum of the non-zero elements.\n\nIn the first output row: 0 1 1. The non-zero elements are 1 and 1, so maybe 1 is the output. But the second output row is 1 5 2, which has non-zero elements 5 and 2. So maybe the output is the sum of the non-zero elements divided by something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the number of times a certain value appears. For example, in the first output row, 1 appears twice, so 1 is the output. In the second output row, 5 appears once, and 2 appears twice, summing to 7, but it's represented as 5 2. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the non-zero elements in the output rows and see if they correspond to certain positions in the input.\n\nFor the first output row in Example 1: 6 6 7.\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n- The first input row has all zeros.\n- The second input row has two 6s.\n- The third input row has two 5s.\n\nSo maybe 6 and 5 contribute to the 6 and 7 in the output. 6 is from two 6s, 5 is from two 5s, and 7 is a standalone value.\n\nFor the second output row: 0 5 7.\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n- The first input row is all zeros.\n- The second input row has one 6, which contributes to 5.\n- The third input row has two 5s, contributing to 7.\n\nSo 6 becomes 5, 5s become 7.\n\nThird output row: 4 4 0.\n\nInput rows:\n- First: all zeros.\n- Second: two 6s, contributing to 4 each.\n- Third: two 5s, contributing to 4 each.\n\nSo 6 becomes 4, 5 becomes 4.\n\nNow, looking at the second example:\n\nInput:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n\n```\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n```\n\nLooking at the second output row, 7 5 7. The input row with 7 has only one 7, so maybe it's contributing to 7. The 5 in the input row has one 5, contributing to 5. The 6 in another input row contributes to 2, but 6 is higher than 2, so maybe it's a division.\n\nIn the first output row: 6 2 2. The 6 is from a row with two 6s, which may be divided by 3 (since 6/3=2). The 5 in the input row contributes to 5, but in the output, it's 5, so maybe it's the maximum.\n\nWait, for the second output row, 7 5 7. The 7s could come from the 5s in the input. Maybe 5 becomes 5, and 7s come from something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a certain value appears in the input row.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider how the output is derived from the input rows.\n\nLooking back at the third example:\n\nInput rows have various 0s and single or multiple 1s, 5s, 7s.\n\nOutput rows are:\n\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\nHmm, the first output row is 0 1 1. It has a 1 which could be from a 1 in the input, and another 1 from a 5 becoming 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the input elements in each row.\n\nBut in the first example, the input rows have:\n\nFirst input row: sum is 0 (all zeros).\nSecond input row: 6 + 6 = 12.\nThird input row: 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nOutput rows:\n\nFirst output row: 6 + 6 + 7 = 19?\nWait, no, the output rows are 6,6,7; 0,5,7; 4,4,0. So sum is 6+6+7=19, 0+5+7=12, 4+4+0=8. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, in the first output row, it's 6,6,7, which are the values, not the sum.\n\nSo that approach is out.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is based on the positions of 1s, 5s, and 7s in the input.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput row 3 has 1,1,0. Output row starts with 0,1,1.\n\nSo the 1s in the input become the 1s in the output.\n\nIn Input row 4, there's 1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Output has 1,5,2.\n\nSo 1,5 become 1,5, and the 0 becomes 2.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of times a certain pattern appears in the input.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps each output element corresponds to a specific value in the input, based on some rule. For example, the first output element is the maximum value in the first column of the input row.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput columns:\nFirst column: all zeros.\nSecond column: 0,0,6,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.\nThird column: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0.\n\nOutput first row: 6,6,7. So 6 is the maximum in the second column, 6 is the maximum in the third column, and 7 is... wait, the third column of the input is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The maximum is 5, but in the output, it's 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is the sum of the non-zero elements in a specific row or column.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nFirst output row: 6,6,7. Let's see:\n\nThe first input row has two 6s, so maybe 6+6=12, but output is 6.\n\nThe second input row has two 6s, 6+6=12, but output is 6.\n\nThe third input row has two 5s, 5+5=10, but output is 7.\n\nNot matching.\n\nWait, maybe each output element is the count of non-zero elements in a specific subgrid or something.\n\nLooking at the third example:\n\nInput row 1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\nOutput row 1: 0,1,1\n\nSo the first output element is 0, which is the maximum of the first column (all zeros), and the other two are 1s.\n\nIn the second output row, 7,5,7:\n\n7 is the maximum of the first column, 5 is the maximum of the second column, and 7 is the maximum of the third column.\n\nThird output row, 9,9,2:\n\n9 is the maximum of the first column, 9 is the maximum of the second column, and 2 is... the maximum of the third column? But third column has 7,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So maximum is 7, not 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no: third output row is 9,9,2. So 9,9, and 2. The first two are maximums of the columns, and the third is 2, which is the maximum of the third column. But the third column's maximum is 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the minimum of the non-zero elements in each subgrid. Or maybe it's the maximum of some specific set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the digits in the input row, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is generated by looking at the input and replacing certain values with others based on some rule.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input row with 6 and 6 becomes 6 and 6 in the output. The input row with 6 and 5 becomes 0 and 5 in the output. The input row with 5 and 5 becomes 4 and 4 in the output.\n\nWait, that's not consistent.\n\nWait, no: the first output row is 6,6,7. The first input row has two 6s, so they become 6,6. The second input row has two 6s, so they become 6,6. The third input row has two 5s, so they become 4,4. But the output is 6,6,7, not 4,4,7.\n\nSo that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the number of times a certain value appears in a specific subgrid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the digits in each input row.\n\nIn Example 1, the first input row has 0s, so sum is 0. Second input row has 6+6=12, third input row has 5+5=10. Output rows have 6,6,7; 0,5,7; 4,4,0. So 6,6,7: 6+6=12, but output is 6. 0+5+7=12, but output is 0. 4+4+0=8, but output is 4.", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

So, looking at the examples provided, I need to find a common rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let's go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nHmm, looking at the first row of the input, all zeros except the last three are 6 and 6. The output has 6, 6, 7. It seems like the last element in the input becomes the output. For the second row, the last two are 6 and 6, and the output is 0, 5, 7. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's not just the last element.\n\nLooking at the third row, the last two are 5 and 5, and the output is 4, 4, 0. Again, not matching the last elements. Maybe it's about some kind of averaging or transformation.\n\nLet's look at a different example. Example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nHere, the first row of the input is all zeros except the second element is 6, and the output is 6, 2, 2. The second row has a 6 in the second position, output is 7,5,7. The third row has a 6 in the third position, output is 3,3,3.\n\nThis suggests that the output is based on some transformation of the input elements, maybe involving division or multiplication. Let's try to find a relationship.\n\nLooking at the first output row: 6,6,7. The input row had 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6. Maybe each element in the output is related to the corresponding elements in the input.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first output row is 6,6,7. The input has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Maybe the rule is to add 6 and 6 and 7. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the input by some kind of average or multiplication. Let's consider that.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the non-zero elements and see if they follow a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the non-zero elements in the input are 6,6,5,5,4,4,7,7,0,0, etc. The output seems to have higher numbers, especially the first row has 6,6,7. Maybe the rule is to replace the non-zero elements with their neighbor's values.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the surrounding elements. For example, in the input, the 6s are in the middle, and the 7 is at the end. Maybe the output is formed by taking the surrounding elements' values.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Example 2. The input has 6 in the second row, and the output is 6,2,2. Maybe 2 is the average of 0 and 4? Not sure.\n\nLet's try to see if there's a pattern in the output rows. For example, in Example 1, the output is 6,6,7; 0,5,7; 4,4,0.\n\nIn Example 2, the output is 6,2,2; 7,5,7; 3,3,3.\n\nIn Example 3, the output is 0,1,1; 1,5,2; 9,9,2.\n\nHmm, maybe the output is based on some kind of transformation where each element is the sum of the surrounding elements divided by a certain number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each output element is the maximum of the two adjacent elements in the input. But in Example 1, the 7 in the output seems to be higher than the surrounding 6s, which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's about the position of the non-zero elements. For example, in Example 1, the non-zero elements are at positions 6,6,7. Maybe the output is formed by taking these positions and using their values in some way.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output first row is 6,6,7. The input has 6s at positions 6,6,7. Maybe the rule is that the output is formed by taking the value of the last element in the input.\n\nBut in the second output row, the 0s are in positions 6,6,7, and the output is 0,5,7. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the difference between elements. For example, in the first output row, 6-0=6, 6-0=6, 7-0=7. That might be a possibility, but it's not consistent with the other rows.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 2. The first output row is 6,2,2. The input row has 6 in the second position. Maybe the output is the maximum of the two surrounding elements. For example, in the second output row, the 0,5,7: 5 is the maximum of 0 and 5. Similarly, 7 is the maximum of 5 and 7.\n\nBut in the first output row, 6,2,2: 2 is the maximum of 0 and 2, and 7 is the maximum of 6 and 7. So perhaps the rule is to take the maximum of each group of three elements, where each group consists of the element and its two neighbors.\n\nFor example, in the first output row, the first three elements (6,6,7) are taken as is, since they are the end of the row. The second group is 0,5,7; maximum is 7, but in the output it's 5,7. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the maximum of each pair of adjacent elements. For example, in the first output row, 6 and 6, 6 and 7. The maximums would be 6,6,7. That matches the output. Similarly, in the second output row, 0 and 5 gives 5, 5 and 7 gives 7, so the output is 0,5,7.\n\nWait, that seems to fit. Let's test it with other rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the third output row is 4,4,0. The input has 4s at positions 3,4,5. Taking each pair: (4,4) gives 4, (4,0) gives 4, (0,0) gives 0. So the output would be 4,4,0. That matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the third output row is 9,9,2. The input has 9s at positions 6,7,8. Taking pairs: (9,9) gives 9, (9,0) gives 9, (0,0) gives 0. Wait, but the output is 9,9,2. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's not about pairs. Maybe it's about the element itself. For example, in the third output row, 9,9,2. The input has 9s in positions 6,7,8. Maybe the rule is that the output is 9,9,2 only if the next element is 0. But in the input, the next element after 9 is 0. So perhaps the output is the 9s followed by 2 if the next element is 0.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the third output row is 4,4,0. The input has 4s in positions 3,4,5. The next element after 5 is 0. So perhaps the output is 4,4,0.\n\nIn Example 2, the third output row is 9,9,2. The input has 9s in positions 6,7,8. The next element after 8 is 0. So perhaps the output is 9,9,2.\n\nIn Example 3, the third output row is 9,9,2. The input has 9s in positions 6,7,8. The next element after 8 is 0. So again, the output would be 9,9,2.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the rule is: for each group of three consecutive elements, the output is formed by taking the value of the middle element in the group as the first element, the rightmost element as the second, and the leftmost element as the third. But wait, that doesn't fit. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the value of the middle element in the group as the first element, the next element as the second, and the previous element as the third. Wait, that might not make sense.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the position of non-zero elements. For example, in the first output row of Example 1, the non-zero elements are at the end. Maybe the rule is that the output is formed by taking the value of the last element in the input as the first element in the output, the next last element as the second, and the previous element as the third.\n\nLet me test this:\n\nIn Example 1, the last element is 7. The second last is 6, and the previous is 0. So the output would be 7,6,0. But the output is 6,6,7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the element itself. For example, in the first output row, the 6 in the second position is taken as the second element, the 7 in the third position is taken as the third element, and the 0 is taken as the first element. So the output would be 0,6,7. But the output is 6,6,7. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to take the value of the middle element in the group of three. For example, in the first output row, the middle element is 6, so the output is 6,6,7. But the input has 0,0,0 in the first three elements, and 6,6,7 in the last three.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the position of the non-zero elements. For example, in the first output row, the non-zero elements are at the end, so their positions determine the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to take the value of the element itself as the output. But that wouldn't explain the second output row.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the maximum of the three elements in each group. For example, in the first output row, the maximum of 6,6,7 is 7, but the output is 6,6,7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the value of the element and the next element. For example, in the first output row, 6 and 6 give 6, 6 and 7 give 7, but the output is 6,6,7. That fits.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the first output row has 6,6,7. The input has 0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0. So the non-zero elements are at positions 6,6,7. The rule might be that the output is formed by taking the value of the middle element as the first element, the next element as the second, and the previous as the third. So for the group 0,6,6, the output would be 6,6,7. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the value of the element and the next element as the first two elements and the last element as the third. For example, in the first output row, 6 and 6 give 6, 6 and 7 give 7, but the output is 6,6,7. That fits.\n\nIn Example 1, the third output row is 4,4,0. The input has 4,4,0. So, the output is 4,4,0. That fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the third output row is 9,9,2. The input has 9,9,0. So, the output would be 9,9,2. That fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the third output row is 9,9,2. The input has 9,9,0. So again, the output would be 9,9,2. That fits.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: for each group of three consecutive elements, the output is formed by taking the middle element as the first element, the next element as the second, and the previous element as the third.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the second element is 6, and the third is 7. So the output is 6,6,7.\n\nWait, no, the output is 6,6,7, but according to this rule, the middle element is 6, the next is 7, and the previous is 6. So the output would be 6,7,6. But in the output, it's 6,6,7.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe the rule is that each output element is the value of the corresponding element in the input. But that would mean that the output is the same as the input, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to take the value of the element and the next element, and for the third element, take the value of the previous element. So for each group of three, the output is the first element of the group, the second element, and the third element.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the position of the non-zero elements. For example, in Example 1, the non-zero elements are at positions 6,6,7. So the output is formed by taking the value of the last element (7) as the first element, the previous element (6) as the second, and the one before that (0) as the third. But the output is 6,6,7, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output is formed by taking the value of the element itself, and the next element, and the previous element. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each group of three consecutive elements, the output is formed by taking the value of the middle element as the first element, the next element as the second, and the previous element as the third. Let's test this:\n\nIn Example 1, the first output row is 6,6,7. The input has 0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0. So the first group is 0,6,6. The middle element is 6, next is 0, previous is 6. So the output would be 6,0,6, but the output is 6,6,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output is formed by taking the value of the element and the next element, and the third element is zero. So for the first output row, it's 6,6,0. But the output is 6,6,7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output is formed by taking the value of the last element, and the previous two elements. For example, in Example 1, the last three elements are 0,0,7. The output is 6,6,7. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each group of three, the output is formed by taking the value of the element and the next element, divided by some number. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the output is formed by taking the middle element as the first element, the next element as the second, and the previous element as the third. But let's test it with Example 1's first output row:\n\nInput middle element is 6, next is 6, previous is 0. Output would be 6,6,0, but output is 6,6,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output is formed by taking the value of the element and the next element, and the third element is the previous element. So for the first output row, 6,6,0.

I'll start by looking at the examples provided to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput grid has a lot of zeros except for some numbers in the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th rows. The output grid has non-zero values in the same position where the input had numbers greater than zero.\n\nIn the first line of the output, I see 6, 6, 7. The input in that row had zeros except for the 6th and 7th columns which were 6, and then a 7 in the last column. So it looks like the output values are based on the maximum value in the corresponding row and column in the input.\n\nWait, let me check that. For the first output row: 6, 6, 7. In the input, the 6th column had 6, the 7th column had 6, and the last column had 6. But in the output, the last value is 7. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Maybe it's not the maximum of each cell.\n\nLooking at the second output row: 0, 5, 7. The input had 0, 5, and 5 in the first three positions. So perhaps the output is the sum of the row and column indices or something like that.\n\nWait, let's see. In the first output row, 6 6 7. The first two positions are 6, which might correspond to some calculation based on the input values. Maybe it's the sum of the two adjacent cells or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output cell is the maximum value between the corresponding input cell and another cell from the same row or column.\n\nLooking at the third output row: 4 4 0. The input had 0, 4, and 4. So maybe the output is the minimum of the input cell and another cell.\n\nWait, let's consider the first output row again: 6 6 7. The first two input cells are 0, 0, and the third is 6. So maybe the output is the third cell, which is 6. That would suggest that the output is often the value in the cell that's not zero in the input.\n\nLooking at the second output row: 0, 5, 7. The first input cell is 0, and the last two are 5 and 7. So again, the last non-zero cell is 7.\n\nIn the third output row: 4 4 0. The first two cells are 4, which might be the value from the same position in the input where a non-zero value exists.\n\nWait, let's try to see if there's a consistent rule across all examples. Let's take the second example to check.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 9 in the 9th row, which becomes 9 in the output. Another 9 in the 7th row becomes 9 in the output. A 2 in the 8th row becomes 2 in the output. Similarly, a 7 in the 4th row becomes 7 in the output. So the rule seems to be that each output cell is the maximum of the corresponding input cell and another cell from the same row or column.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the first output row has 6, 6, 7. The input had 6, 6, and 7. So perhaps the output is the maximum of the input cell and the cell to its right or below.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the value of the cell in the input grid that is the highest in its row or column.\n\nWait, let's take the first output row of Example 1: 6, 6, 7. The input in that row had 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the maximum in that row is 6, which appears in the 6th and 7th columns. The output has 6 in both positions, which suggests that the output is the maximum value in that row, but only in the first two columns, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the value in the same cell as the maximum in the row or column.\n\nWait, let's consider that the output is the value of the cell in the input that is the maximum in the same row or column.\n\nLet's see. In the first example, the output first row is 6,6,7. The maximum in the first row is 6, and the maximum in the third column is 6. So perhaps the output is the maximum of each cell, but only in the same row or column.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output first row has 6,6,7. The maximum in the first row is 6, which is in column 6. The maximum in the third column is 6, which is in row 7. So perhaps the output is the maximum of each cell in the corresponding row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the maximum value in the corresponding row or column for each cell.\n\nWait, let's consider the third example, where the input has a 9 in the 9th row, which becomes 9 in the output. Similarly, the 7th row in the input has a 7, which becomes 7 in the output.\n\nSo it seems that the output is the maximum of the input cell and the cell in the same row or column.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the maximum value between the current cell and the cell to the right or below it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the maximum value in the row or column, whichever is larger.\n\nWait, let's take the second example:\n\nInput has a 9 in the 9th row, which becomes 9 in the output. Similarly, the 7th row in the input has a 7, which becomes 7 in the output.\n\nIn the third example, the 7th row in the output is 3,3,3. The input in the 7th row has 5 in the 4th column, 0 in the 5th, and 8 in the 8th column. So perhaps the maximum is 8, but the output is 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the minimum of the input cell and another cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the row and column indices.\n\nWait, let's take the first example. The input has a 6 in the 6th column, which is in row 6. The output is 6. The 7th column in row 7 is 6, output is 6. The last cell in row 10 is 7, output is 7.\n\nSo perhaps the output is the value in the cell where the row and column indices are the same as the maximum in the input grid.\n\nWait, but that might not be consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the value of the cell in the input grid that is the maximum in its row or column, whichever is larger.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output first row is 6,6,7. The maximum in the first row is 6, which is in columns 6 and 7. The maximum in the third column is 6, which is in row 7. So the output would be 6,6,6. But in the output, it's 6,6,7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the maximum of the cell and the cell in the same row or column.\n\nFor example, in the first cell of the first output row, 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, the first non-zero is 6 in the 6th column. So perhaps the output is determined by the highest value in the same row or column.\n\nWait, let's try to find a rule that applies across all examples.\n\nLooking at the first example:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nSo the first output row has 6,6,7. The input in that row had 0s except for 6 in columns 6 and 7, and a 7 in the 8th column in row 8.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the value of the cell in the input that is the maximum in its row or column.\n\nIn the first row of the output, the first two cells are 6, which were the maximum in their respective rows or columns. The third cell is 7, which was the maximum in the 8th column.\n\nIn the second output row, 0,5,7. The first cell is 0, which is the maximum in its row. The second cell is 5, which was the maximum in its row or column. The third cell is 7, which was the maximum in the 8th column.\n\nIn the third output row, 4,4,0. The first two cells are 4, which were the maximum in their respective rows.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the input had a 9 in the 9th row, which became 9 in the output. Similarly, a 7 in the 4th row became 7 in the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input had a 9 in the 7th row, which became 9 in the output.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that each output cell is the maximum value between the current cell and the cell in the same row or column.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nFor the first output row: 6,6,7. The first cell is 0, which is the maximum in its row, so 6 is the maximum in its row or column. The second cell is 0, which is the maximum in its row, so 6 is the maximum in its row or column. The third cell is 0, which is the maximum in its row, so 7 is the maximum between 0 and 7.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit because the output is 6,6,7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the value of the cell that is the maximum in its row or column.\n\nIn the first row of the output, the first two cells are 6, which are the maximum in their respective rows, and the third cell is 7, which is the maximum in the 8th column.\n\nIn the second row, 0 is the maximum in its row, 5 is the maximum in its column, and 7 is the maximum in the 8th column.\n\nIn the third row, 4,4 are the maximum in their rows, and 0 in the last column.\n\nThat seems to fit the examples.\n\nSo the rule is that each output cell is the maximum value between the current input cell and the cell in the same row or column.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which cell to compare? Maybe it's the cell in the same row, same column, or another cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the maximum of the cell in the same row and the cell in the same column.\n\nWait, for example, in the first output row, 6 is the maximum between 0 and 6 in the same column, and 7 is the maximum between 0 and 7 in the same column.\n\nWait, but the output third cell is 7, which is the maximum of 0 and 7. The output first two cells are 6, which is the maximum of 0 and 6.\n\nSo perhaps, for each cell, the output is the maximum of the current cell and the cell in the same row or column.\n\nWait, but in the first output row, the cell in the same column as 0 is 6, so the output is 6. For the same column as 7, the output is 7.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, to find the output grid, for each cell (i,j), we look at the maximum value between the input[i][j] and the input[j][i], where j is the column index.\n\nWait, no, because in the first example, the third cell in the first row is 7, which was in the same column as the 6 in the same row, or the same column as the 7 in the 8th row.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that for each cell (i,j), the output is the maximum of the current cell and the cell in the same column i and row j, or the same row i and column j.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more about comparing the current cell with the cell in the same row or same column.\n\nWait, let's take the first output row:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nSo the first output row is 6,6,7. The first column is 0s, the second column is 0s, and the third column is 6,6,7.\n\nWait, but that doesn't fit the rule I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the maximum value in the entire grid.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the maximum is 7, which is in the third cell of the eighth row.\n\nBut in the output, the third cell is 7, which matches that.\n\nIn Example 2, the maximum is 9, which is in the ninth row, and the output third cell is 9.\n\nIn Example 3, the maximum is 9, which is in the seventh row, and the output third cell is 9.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that each output cell (i,j) is the value of the cell (i,j) if it's larger than the cell (j,i), else the cell (j,i). Or perhaps it's the maximum of the current cell and the cell in the same position.\n\nWait, let's test that.\n\nFor the first output row, each cell is 6,6,7. The cell (1,1) is 0, which is less than cell (1,1) of the input, which is 0. The cell (1,2) is 0, which is less than cell (2,1) which is 0. The cell (1,3) is 0, which is less than cell (3,1) which is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the maximum of the current cell and the cell in the same column and row.\n\nWait, in the first output row, the first cell is 6, which was the maximum in its column. The second cell is 6, which was the maximum in its column. The third cell is 7, which was the maximum in its column.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nIn the second output row, the first cell is 0, which is the maximum in its column. The second cell is 5, which was the maximum in its column. The third cell is 7, which was the maximum in its column.\n\nIn the third output row, the first cell is 4, which was the maximum in its column. The second cell is 4, which was the maximum in its column. The third cell is 0, which was the maximum in its column.\n\nWait, but in the third output row, the third cell is 0. So perhaps it's the maximum of the current cell and the cell in the same column.\n\nWait, but in the third row of the first output, the third cell is 7, which was the maximum in its column.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that each output cell (i,j) is the maximum value between the input cell (i,j) and the input cell (j,i).\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nIn the first output row, the first cell is 6. The input cell (1,1) is 0, and the cell (1,1) of the input is 0. So the maximum is 0, but the output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the maximum of the current cell and the cell in the same row.\n\nWait, in the first output row, the first cell is 6, which was the maximum in its row.

Let me start by examining the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input has a grid with a lot of zeros except for some numbers. The output grid has different numbers in each row. The first row of the input is all zeros except for two 6s in the middle. The output for that row is 6, 6, 7. Hmm, interesting. So maybe the 6s are being combined into a single 7 somehow.\n\nLet me look at the second row of the input. It has 0s except for a 5 in the fourth column and a 0 in the rest. The output for that row is 0, 5, 7. Wait, why is the first element 0? Maybe there's a rule where certain columns are summed or something. But 0 and 5 and 7\u2014that doesn't immediately add up. Or perhaps it's a matter of counting something else.\n\nLooking at the third row of the input, it has 4s in positions 3 and 4. The output is 4, 4, 0. So, the sum of 4+4 is 8, which isn't 0. Maybe it's not adding. Alternatively, perhaps 4s are being reduced to 0 in some way, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nLet me consider the columns. The first column of the output seems to have 6, 0, 0. The second column is 6, 5, 0. The third column is 7, 7, 0. Wait a minute, in the output, the first three elements are 6, 6, 7\u2014so the first 6 is from the input's second row, the second 6 is from the first row, and the 7 comes from the third row. Similarly, the second column of the output is 6, 5, 7\u2014so maybe each element in the output is derived from the corresponding column in the input after applying some rule.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern in the input columns. For the first column of the output, it's 6, 0, 0. Looking at the input, the first column of the third row is 4, so perhaps it's being set to 6 if it's non-zero. Wait, but in the output, the first element is 6, the second is 0, and the third is 0. So maybe for the first column, any non-zero value is carried over, but zeros are kept as zeros. That would explain the first element being 6.\n\nFor the second column of the output, it's 6, 5, 7. The input's first row has a 0, the second row has a 0, and the third row has a 5. So perhaps the second column is the maximum of the non-zero values in that column. Let's check:\n\n- First row: 0, so max is 0.\n- Second row: 0, so max is 0.\n- Third row: 5, so max is 5. But the output is 6 in the second column. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum, but 0+0+5=5, which is not 6. Or perhaps it's the number of times a non-zero appears. For the second column:\n\n- First row: 0 \u2192 count 0\n- Second row: 0 \u2192 count 0\n- Third row: 5 \u2192 count 1 \u2192 output 1, but the output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe it's the minimum. 0, 0, 5 \u2192 minimum is 0, but output is 6. Not matching.\n\nPerhaps it's the position of the highest number. The third row's second element is 5. Maybe the highest non-zero in that column is 5, and the output is 6. That could be a possibility.\n\nWait, but the first element of the output is 6. So that might be a coincidence. Let me check other columns.\n\nFor the third column of the output: 7,7,0. The input's third column for each row:\n\n- First row: 0 \u2192 output 7? Doesn't fit.\n- Second row: 0 \u2192 output 7? Doesn't fit.\n- Third row: 9 \u2192 output 7? Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, that's puzzling. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another angle.\n\nLooking at Example 2, perhaps the rule is more involved. The input has some 6s and 0s, and the output has 6, 2, 2. Maybe the 6 is being converted into 6, and the 2s are from the 0s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule involves the number of times a non-zero appears in the row or column. For instance, in Example 1, the second row of the input has a single 6, which could correspond to the 6 in the output. The third row has two 4s, so maybe the output has two 4s. But that doesn't directly explain the rest.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the sum of the non-zero elements in the row or column. Let me check Example 1 again.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of the output is 6,6,7. The sum of the first row's non-zero elements is 0+0+6+6+6+7=25. But that doesn't seem to relate to 6,6,7. So that's probably not it.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is derived from the positions of the non-zero elements in the input. For example, the 6s in the output might correspond to the positions of the 6s in the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\n6 6 7\n\n0 5 7\n\n4 4 0\n\nSo, the 6s in the output are in the first and second rows. The 5 in the second row is in the fourth column, and the 7s are in the third row. Maybe the 6s come from the first and second rows, and the 7s come from the third row.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the output has 6,2,2. The 6 is in the first row, the 2s in the second. So maybe this rule applies to each row, taking the non-zero elements and using their positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid's elements are determined by the number of non-zero elements in each row of the input. For example, the first row has 12 zeros and two 6s, so maybe the output uses the count or some function of that.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output is 6,6,7. That's three numbers, and the input has 12 zeros except for some 6s. Maybe it's related to the sum or product of the non-zero elements in each row.\n\nFor the first row of Example 1: 0+0+0+0+0+6+6+0+0+0+0 = 12. The output is 6,6,7. 12 doesn't relate to 6 and 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the count of non-zero elements divided by the row length. For the first row, 6+6=12 non-zero, divided by 12 positions, gives 1. But the output is 6,6,7\u2014doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe each output element corresponds to a specific rule applied to each row of the input.\n\nLooking back at Example 3, the input has 0s and some 1s, 5s, 9s, and 7s. The output has 0s, 1s, 9s, and 9s. So perhaps the 1 and 9s are being converted into something else.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the first row of the output is 0,1,1. So maybe the 1s are being converted into 1s, and the 9s are being converted into 9s. But that doesn't explain the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation of the input grid based on some mathematical operation, like addition, multiplication, or bitwise operations.\n\nLooking at the input rows, some have multiple non-zero elements, some have zeros. The output seems to have non-zero elements only in certain positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a transformation of the input based on the positions of the non-zero elements. For example, each non-zero element in the input grid is being moved to a specific position in the output grid.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\n6 6 7\n\n0 5 7\n\n4 4 0\n\nSo, the 6 in the first row and second column is from the input's fourth column. The 5 is from the input's fourth row, second column. The 7 is from the input's third row, third column.\n\nWait, maybe the 6s are from the 6s in the input. So, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking the non-zero elements from each row of the input and placing them in specific positions based on some rule.\n\nBut I'm not seeing the pattern yet. Maybe I should try to find a rule that applies to all examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps each output element is the sum of the digits of the corresponding row in the input. Let's test that.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nFirst row: 0+0+0+0+0+6+6+0+0+0+0 = 12 \u2192 1+2=3. But output is 6,6,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nSecond row: 0+0+0+0+0+6+6+0+0+0+0 = 12 \u2192 3. But output is 0,5,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nThird row: 0+0+4+4+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 8 \u2192 8. But output is 4,4,0. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis doesn't seem to work.\n\nWait, maybe it's the count of non-zero elements in each row. For the first row, 6+6=12 non-zero elements. But the output is 6,6,7\u2014doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the squares of the non-zero elements. For the first row: 6\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 = 36 + 36 = 72. Output is 6,6,7\u2014doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Perhaps I need to look for a pattern in the positions of non-zero elements in the output compared to the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\n6 is in positions 1, 2, 5\nWait, the output is 6 6 7. So the first and second elements are 6, and the third is 7. The input's third row has 4,4,0, so maybe 4s are being added to 2s (from the second row) to get 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are the sum of the non-zero elements in the first row, and the 7 is the sum of the non-zero elements in the third row.\n\nFirst row: 0+0+0+0+0+6+6+0+0+0+0 = 12. 1+2=3, but output is 6.\n\nSecond row: 0+0+0+0+0+0+6+6+0+0+0=12 \u2192 3. Output is 0,5,7. Doesn't match.\n\nThird row: 4+4+0=8 \u2192 8. Output is 4,4,0. Doesn't match.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps each output element corresponds to the sum of the non-zero elements in its respective row, but the output is taking the first occurrence of a non-zero element and placing it. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the non-zero elements are 6 and 6 in positions 6 and 7. The output has 6 in positions 1 and 2, which might correspond to the first two non-zero elements. Then the 7 is in position 3, which could be the sum of the non-zero elements in the third row.\n\nLet me test this:\n\nFirst row: The first two non-zero elements are 6 and 6. Output has 6 and 6 in positions 1 and 2.\n\nThird row: The non-zero element is 4 and 4, which would sum to 8, but the output has 4 in positions 1 and 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is the sum of the non-zero elements in its respective column.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFor the first column of the output, it's 6,0,0. Sum of the first column in the input is 0 (first row) + 0 (second row) + 4 (third row) + ... + 0. So 4. But output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the sum of the non-zero elements in the row, but the output is taking the first non-zero element and placing it in the first position, followed by zeros. But in Example 1, the first row has two 6s, so the output would have 6, 6, 0, but the output is 6,6,7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the 7 in the output is the sum of the non-zero elements in the third row. The third row has 4 and 4, so 8, but the output is 7. Maybe it's a typo or I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAnother approach: look for a pattern in the output numbers based on the input grid.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput grid has 6s in the second and sixth rows. The output has 6s in the first and second rows, and a 7 in the third row.\n\nThe third row of the input has 4,4,0. The output has 4,4,0. So perhaps the 4s are being preserved.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 6,2,2. The input has 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 in the first row, which is transformed into 6,2,2. So the 6 comes from somewhere, and the 2s come from zeros.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the rule involves both rows and columns, or perhaps it's based on the positions of non-zero elements.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps each output element is the sum of the non-zero elements in its respective row, but only considering the first non-zero element and a certain number of zeros. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the first non-zero element is 6, so the output is 6,6,7. The second 6 is perhaps the count or something.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput has 0s and some 1,5,9,7s. The output has 0s,1,9,9. So perhaps the 1 and 9s are being converted into something else.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements from the input and moving them to specific positions in the output grid based on their row or column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is a transformation of the input grid where each output element is the sum of the input's elements in the corresponding row and column, but that seems too vague.\n\nAnother approach: let's consider the output grid as a result of some kind of convolution or matrix operation. But that's probably beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule involves the positions of the non-zero elements in each row. For example, in the first row of the output, the 6s are in columns 1 and 2. Maybe these columns are determined by some rule based on the input.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should consider that each output element corresponds to the number of non-zero elements in a specific position or something like that.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output has 6,6,7. The first row has 6 non-zero elements, so why is 6 in the first element? Maybe it's the count divided by something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a result of the sum of the input's elements in the same column, but shifted.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the non-zero elements in each row and placing them diagonally in the output grid. For example, in Example 1:\n\nFirst row of output: 6,6,7\n\nSecond row: 0,5,7\n\nThird row:4,4,0\n\nSo, the 6 in the first row is from the first non-zero element of the first row. The 5 from the second non-zero element of the second row. The 7 from the first non-zero of the third row.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has two non-zero elements (6 and 6). The output first two elements are 6,6. The third element is 7, which could be the sum of the non-zero elements in the third row.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFirst row of input: 0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0 \u2192 non-zero elements at positions 6,7. So output first two elements are 6,6, which matches.\n\nSecond row of input: 0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0 \u2192 same as first row. Output second element is 5, but according to this rule, it should be 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is the sum of the non-zero elements in the row, but the output takes the count or something. Alternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the number of non-zero elements in each row and placing them in the corresponding columns.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row has 12 non-zero elements, divided by 3 columns, giving 4, but the output is 6. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. Perhaps the output is a result of some mathematical operation applied to each row of the input.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps each output element is the product of the input's elements in its row and column, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the input's elements in the same row and column, but shifted.\n\nWait, perhaps the output", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are three examples provided, and I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input into the output for each case. Once I understand the rule, I can apply it to the given test input grid to predict the output.\n\nLet me start by examining Example 1 in detail. The input grid is 12 rows and 11 columns, mostly filled with zeros except for some specific numbers. The output is a grid with three rows and three columns. I'll write down the input and output to better see the patterns.\n\nInput Example 1:\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput Example 1:\nRow 1: 6 6 7\nRow 2: 0 5 7\nRow 3: 4 4 0\n\nNow, looking at the output, each row has three elements.

Maybe the rule involves the values in the last three columns of each row.\n\nLooking at Output row 1: 6, 6, 7. These numbers 6 and 7 are present in the Input rows 2, 8, etc. For Output row 1, elements 1 and 2 are 6, which are from Input rows 2, column 7 and column 8. Element 3 is 7, which is from Input row 8, column 8.\n\nFor Output row 2: 0,5,7. Element 1 is 0, which could be from Input row 1, column 1. Element 2 is 5, which is in Input row 3, column 4 and 5. Element 3 is 7, which is again from Input row 8, column 6.\n\nFor Output row 3: 4,4,0. Element 1 is 4, which is in Input row 3, column 3 and 4. Element 2 is 4, same as above. Element 3 is 0, which is from Input row 1, 2, 5, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the rule might involve the last three columns of each row. For example, in Output row 1, the last column (column 8) of each row that contributes to this output is 6, 7, and 7 (but in Output row 1, it's 6,6,7). Wait, that doesn't quite add up.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is derived by taking the last three columns of the input and applying some operation. For instance, in Output row 1, 6,6,7: 6 comes from Input row 2, column 7 and 8; 7 comes from Input row 8, column 8. So maybe 6 and 7 are the values from the last two columns of different rows contributing to the same output column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each output column is the maximum or minimum of certain values in the input. For Output row 1, columns 1, 2, 3: 6,6,7. 6 could be the maximum of some values, and 7 could be the sum or another operation.\n\nLooking at Output row 2: 0,5,7. 0 could be from the minimum of some values, and 5 and 7 from the last two columns of different rows.\n\nWait, maybe each output column is formed by taking the maximum of the last three columns across the input rows for that particular output row. For Output row 1, columns 1,2,3: 6,6,7. The maximum of 6,6,7 is 7, but the output is 7. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output column is the sum or product of certain values. For Output row 1, columns 1,2,3: 6+6+7=19, but that's not matching the output numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps each output column is the sum of the last three columns of the input rows. For Output row 1, 6+6+7=19, but the output is 7. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output element is the sum of certain positions in the input. For example, in Output row 1, 6 could be from Input row 2, column 7 plus something else. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern yet.\n\nLet me check the third output row: 4,4,0. Again, 4s and a 0. The 0 could be from the minimum of certain values, and 4s from the last two columns of different rows.\n\nWait, perhaps each output column is formed by taking the last three columns of the input, and for each output row, the elements are the last three values from the corresponding output row in the input.\n\nWait, that might not fit because the output rows have only three elements, each from different input rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of the last two columns of each input row to form the output.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to look at a different example.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput Example 2:\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput Example 2:\nRow 1: 6 2 2\nRow 2: 7 5 7\nRow 3: 3 3 3\n\nHmm, in Output row 1: 6,2,2. Let's see which rows contribute to each output column. For 6, it's from Input row 3, column 2. For 2, maybe from Input row 3, column 8 and 9, but those are 0. Or perhaps from other rows.\n\nWait, Output row 1 has 6,2,2. 6 comes from Input row 3, column 2. 2 could be from Input row 3, column 8 and 9, but those are 0. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nIn Output row 2: 7,5,7. 7 comes from Input row 3, column 9, but 9 is 0. Maybe from Input row 4, columns 5 and 6. 5 is from Input row 4, column 4. 7 from column 7 and 8.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the last two columns of each relevant row. For Output row 1: 6 is from row 3, 2 from row 3 (but 2 is present in row 3, column 9? Wait, row 3 is 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, so column 2 is 6, column 9 is 0, column 10 is 0. So 6 comes from column 2. 2 could be from another row, but in row 3, it's 0. Maybe from row 4, column 4 is 5, but output is 7.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me try to see the relationship between Input and Output for all three examples.\n\nLooking back at Example 1, the output is 3x3, and the input is 12x11. The output rows have 3 elements, each from different input rows. Maybe each output element is derived from the last three columns of the corresponding input row. For example, Output row 1: 6,6,7. The last three columns of the input rows that contribute to this output are:\n\n- For 6: Input row 2, column 7 and 8 (columns 7 and 8)\n- For another 6: Input row 2, column 7 and 8 again\n- For 7: Input row 8, column 8\n\nBut I'm not sure how that gives the output as 6,6,7.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is formed by taking the sum of the last three columns across the input rows for each output row. Let me check.\n\nFor Output row 1: 6,6,7. Sum would be 6+6+7=19, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the maximum of the last three columns. For Output row 1, the maximum of 6,6,7 is 7, but the output is 7. That fits.\n\nFor Output row 2: 0,5,7. The maximum of 0,5,7 is 7, but the output is 7. That fits.\n\nFor Output row 3: 4,4,0. The maximum is 4, but the output is 4. That fits.\n\nHmm, that seems promising. So each output row is the maximum of the last three columns of the corresponding output row's input rows.\n\nBut wait, let me check Output row 2: 0 comes from Input row 1, column 1. The last three columns are 0,0,0. So maximum is 0, which matches. The 5 is from Input row 3, column 4, which is 5, and the maximum is 5. The 7 comes from Input row 3, column 8, which is 7. So the maximum is 7, which matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, for Output row 3: 4 comes from Input row 3, column 3; 4 from Input row 3, column 4; and 0 from Input row 3, column 8. The maximum is 4, which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the rule is: for each output row, find the maximum value among the last three columns (columns 9 and 10, since indexing starts at 1) of the corresponding rows in the input that contribute to that output.\n\nWait, but looking at Output row 1: 6,6,7. Input rows contributing are row 2 (columns 7 and 8: 6 and 6) and row 8 (column 8:7). So yes, the maximum is 7.\n\nSimilarly, Output row 2: 0 is from row 1, column 1. 5 is from row 3, column 4. 7 is from row 3, column 8. The maximum is 7.\n\nOutput row 3: 4 is from row 3, column 3. 4 again from column 4. 0 from column 8. The maximum is 4.\n\nSo the rule is, for each output row, take the maximum value from the last three columns (columns 9 and 10) of the corresponding input rows that contribute to that output.\n\nNow, applying this to Example 3:\n\nInput Example 3:\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput Example 3:\nRow 1: 0 1 1\nRow 2: 1 5 2\nRow 3: 9 9 2\n\nWait, let me check Output row 1: 0,1,1. The last three columns of the corresponding input rows are:\n\n- Row 3: columns 9 and 10: 0 and 0, so maximum is 0\n- Maybe another row has 1?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each output row is derived from a different set of input rows. For example, Output row 1 is derived from rows 3, 8, 9, etc. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, each output row corresponds to a certain position in the output, which is determined by the last three columns of the input. So Output row 1 is derived from the last three columns of row 3,8,9, etc. Similarly, Output row 2 is from the last three columns of row 4,9,10, etc. Output row 3 is from the last three columns of row 5,11, etc.\n\nBut in the given Input Example 3, the output rows have three elements, each derived from different input rows. For Output row 1: 0,1,1. Let's see which input rows contribute to these values.\n\n- 0: likely from row 3, column 9.\n- 1: from row 3, column 10.\n- 1: maybe from row 8, column 8.\n\nSo, for Output row 1, the last three columns of row 3 (columns 9 and 10) are 0 and 0, which are maxed out to 0. Then, from row 8, column 8 is 5, so maybe 1 is derived from another position. Wait, perhaps each element in the output row is the maximum of the last three columns of the corresponding input rows. Let me check.\n\nFor Output row 1: 0,1,1.\n\n- 0: from row 3, column 9.\n- 1: from row 3, column 10.\n- 1: from row 8, column 8.\n\nSo, if the rule is to take the maximum of the last three columns (columns 9 and 10), then 0 is the max of 0 and 0, 1 is the max of 1 and 1, and 1 is the max of 5 (from row 8) and 0 (from other rows). But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, maybe each output column is derived from the last three columns of different input rows.\n\nFor Output row 1: 0,1,1.\n\n- 0: from row 3, column 9.\n- 1: from row 3, column 10.\n- 1: from row 8, column 8.\n\nSo, perhaps each element is the maximum of the last three columns of the corresponding input rows.

The examples provided can help me figure out what that rule is. Let me go through each example step by step.\n\nStarting with Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros and some numbers like 6, 7, 5, 4, etc. The output grid seems to have similar numbers but arranged differently. Looking at the first row of the output: 6, 6, 7. Hmm, maybe each number is coming from a specific cell in the input?\n\nLet me think about how cells in the input relate to the output. For instance, the first cell in the input is 0, and the first cell in the output is also 0. The second cell in the input is 0, and the second output cell is 6. That doesn't seem to follow a simple pattern. Maybe I need to look at the positions of the non-zero cells.\n\nIn Example 1, the first non-zero cell is at position (0,0) which is 0, but the output cell (0,0) is 6. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should look at the numbers in the output and see if they correspond to certain cells in the input, like maximum values or something.\n\nLooking at the output grid in Example 1:\n- The first row is 6, 6, 7.\n- The second row is 0, 5, 7.\n- The third row is 4, 4, 0.\n\nSo, each row in the output corresponds to a row in the input. For the first row in the output, 6, 6, 7, perhaps these are the maximum values in each column of the input's first row? Let me check the input.\n\nThe first row of the input is all zeros except for the last cell, which is 0. So the maximum in that column would be 0. But the output is 6, 6, 7. That doesn't fit. Maybe the minimum instead? The minimum of the first row would be 0, but the output is 6, 6, 7. Hmm, that still doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of certain cells. For example, in the output's first row, 6 + 6 = 12, which is close to the sum of the first row in the input, which is 0. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the specific numbers in the output. The first output row is 6, 6, 7. The second output row is 0, 5, 7. The third is 4, 4, 0. It seems like the numbers are duplicates and some are high, others are low. Maybe the output is formed by adding certain values from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output values are the maximum of some function of the input values. For example, if a cell in the input is non-zero, the output might be the maximum of its row or column.\n\nLooking at the output's first row: 6, 6, 7. Maybe these are the maximums of each column in the input's first row. But the first row has only one non-zero, which is 0, so the maximum would be 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the minimum of the row or column. The first row's minimum is 0, but the output is 6, 6, 7. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the absolute difference between certain cells in the input. For example, subtracting adjacent cells or something like that. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me look at Example 2. The input has a 9 in the 9th column, and the output has 9 in the corresponding cell. That suggests that the output might be the maximum value in the input's column. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's first row has 6,6,7. If 7 is the maximum in the 7th column of the input, that could be it. The 7th column in the input has mostly zeros except for the 9th row, which is 9. So the maximum would be 9, but the output is 7. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the maximum of the input's row. Let's check. The first row of the input is all zeros, so the max is 0. But the output is 6,6,7. No, that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the minimum of the row or column. The first row has a 0, so the min is 0. But the output is 6,6,7, which are all higher. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output rows. The first output row is 6,6,7. Maybe these are the values from the third column of the input. Let's check. The third column in the input has 0s, 0s, 0s, 4, 5, 0s, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0. The max of these would be 8, but the output is 7. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the number of non-zero cells in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the first row of the output has 6,6,7. That doesn't immediately make sense.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the output is formed by adding certain cells from the input. For example, in the first output row, 6 + 6 = 12, which is close to the sum of the first row in the input, which is 0. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the product of certain cells. 6 * 6 = 36, which is not 7.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of the first and last non-zero cell in each row. For the first output row, 6 + 6 = 12. But 7 is less than that. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the sum of each column in the input. Let's check Example 1. The first output row is 6,6,7. If these are the sums of each column, then let's see:\n\n- Column 1: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. Output is 6.\n- Column 2: Same as column 1, output 6.\n- Column 3: Sum of 0s and a 7 in the last row, so 7.\n- Column 4: Sum of 0s and a 7, so 7.\n- Column 5: Sum of 0s and a 9, so 9.\n- Column 6: Same as column 5, output 9.\n- Column 7: Sum of 0s and a 0, output 0.\n- Column 8: Same as column 7, output 0.\n- Column 9: Sum of 0s and a 0, output 0.\n- Column 10: Sum of 0s, output 0.\n\nBut the output is 6,6,7,0,7,9,9,0,0,0,0. Doesn't match exactly. The first three columns have 0,0,7 in the output, but the sample output has 6,6,7. So maybe it's not the sum.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the maximum of the column. In the first column, the maximum is 0, output is 6. No. In column 2, same as column 1. Column 3, output is 7, which is the maximum. Column 4, same as column 3. Column 5, output is 9, which is the maximum. Column 6, same as column 5. Columns 7-10 have 0, which is the minimum. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is the number of times a certain value appears in a row or column. For example, in the first row of the output, 6 appears twice and 7 once. Maybe it's the count of a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the first and last non-zero cell in each row. Let's see:\n\nFirst row of output: 6 + 7 = 13. But output is 6,6,7. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of the maximum non-zero values in each column. For example, in column 3, the maximum is 7, which is in the last row. So the output's first column is 6, but that contradicts.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the structure of the output. It's a 11x3 grid, where each column seems to have a pattern. For example, the first output row is 6,6,7. The second is 0,5,7. The third is 4,4,0.\n\nWait, maybe the output is formed by taking the minimum of each column in the input. Let's check:\n\n- Column 1: min is 0, output first cell is 6.\n- Column 2: min is 0, output second cell is 6.\n- Column 3: min is 0, output third cell is 7.\n- Column 4: min is 0, output fourth cell is 7.\n- Column 5: min is 0, output fifth cell is 9.\n- Column 6: min is 0, output sixth cell is 9.\n- Column 7: min is 0, output seventh cell is 0.\n- Column 8: min is 0, output eighth cell is 0.\n- Column 9: min is 0, output ninth cell is 0.\n- Column 10: min is 0, output tenth cell is 0.\n\nBut the output is 6,6,7,0,7,9,9,0,0,0,0. Doesn't match exactly. So maybe it's not the minimum.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the maximum value in each row. Let's see:\n\n- First row of output: 6,6,7. If these are the maxima of each row in the input, let's check.\n\nInput rows:\n- Row 1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 max 0. Output is 6. Doesn't match.\n- Row 2: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0 \u2192 max 9. Output is 6. Doesn't match.\n- Row 3: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,5,0,0 \u2192 max 9. Output is 0. Doesn't match.\n- Row 4: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0 \u2192 max 9. Output is 5. Doesn't match.\n- Row 5: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 max 0. Output is 7. Doesn't match.\n- Row 6: ... and so on. It doesn't seem to fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the output is the sum of the first and last non-zero cell in each row. Let's try that.\n\nRow 1: 0 + 0 = 0, but output is 6.\nRow 2: 9 + 0 = 9, output is 6.\nRow 3: 9 + 0 = 9, output is 0.\nRow 4: 9 + 0 = 9, output is 5.\nRow 5: 0 + 0 = 0, output is 7.\nThat doesn't align either.\n\nWait, maybe it's the difference between the first and last non-zero cell in each row. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 0 - 0 = 0, output is 6.\nRow 2: 9 - 0 = 9, output is 6.\nRow 3: 9 - 0 = 9, output is 0.\nRow 4: 9 - 0 = 9, output is 5.\nRow 5: 0 - 0 = 0, output is 7.\nThat still doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is formed by taking the absolute difference between certain cells. For example, in the first output row, 6 - 0 = 6, 6 - 0 = 6, 7 - 0 = 7. That could be a possibility. Let me see if this holds for other rows.\n\nLooking at the second output row: 0,5,7. If it's the absolute difference of certain cells, maybe 0 is from a cell in the input, and 5 and 7 are differences. But I'm not sure which cells to subtract from.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of each row's cells, but that doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is the product of certain cells, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the maximum value in each column. Let's check:\n\n- Column 1: max is 0, output is 6.\n- Column 2: max is 0, output is 6.\n- Column 3: max is 7, output is 7.\n- Column 4: max is 7, output is 7.\n- Column 5: max is 9, output is 9.\n- Column 6: max is 9, output is 9.\n- Column 7: max is 0, output is 0.\n- Column 8: max is 0, output is 0.\n- Column 9: max is 0, output is 0.\n- Column 10: max is 0, output is 0.\n\nThis matches the output's first three cells. So maybe the output is the maximum of each column in the input. Let's test with Example 2.\n\nExample 2 input has a 9 in column 9, which is the maximum, and the output has 9 in the same position. That matches. Also, the other cells seem to be the maximum of their respective columns. So this seems promising.\n\nLet's verify with Example 1. The output's first row is 6,6,7. If these are the maxima of each column in the input, let's check:\n\n- Column 1: max is 0 \u2192 output is 6. Doesn't match.\n- Column 2: max is 0 \u2192 output is 6. Doesn't match.\n- Column 3: max is 7 \u2192 output is 7. Matches.\n- Column 4: max is 7 \u2192 output is 7. Matches.\n- Column 5: max is 9 \u2192 output is 9. Doesn't match.\n- Column 6: max is 9 \u2192 output is 9. Matches.\n- Columns 7-10: max is 0 \u2192 output is 0,6,7,9,9,0. Wait, in the output, the first row is 6,6,7, but according to the maxima, it should be 0,0,7,7,9,9,0,0,0,0,0. That doesn't match.\n\nHmm, so in Example 1, the maxima don't match the output. So maybe it's not the maximum of each column, but the maximum in some other way.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the sum of each column, but let me check.\n\nIn Example 1, the sum of each column would be:\n\n- Column 1: 0 + 0 + 0 + ... + 0 = 0 \u2192 output is 6.\n- Column 2: same as column 1 \u2192 output is 6.\n- Column 3: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 7 \u2192 output is 7.\n- Column 4: same as column 3 \u2192 output is 7.\n- Column 5: 0 + 0 + 0 + ... + 0 + 9 = 9 \u2192 output is 9.\n- Column 6: same as column 5 \u2192 output is 9.\n- Columns 7-10: 0 \u2192 output is 0,6,7,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0. Wait, in the output, the first row is 6,6,7, which doesn't match the sum approach.\n\nHmm, so maybe it's not the sum of columns. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is formed by taking the maximum value in each row of the input's column.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output's first row is 6,6,7. Let's see what the maximums are in each row of the input's columns:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider that the output is the transpose of the maximum of each column.\n\nWait, in Example 1:\n\nThe max of each column is [0,0,7,7,9,9,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nThe output's first row is 6,6,7. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the output is the sum of certain cells, like the sum of the first and last non-zero in each row.\n\nLet me test that.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of the input is mostly zeros except for the last cell. So the sum would be zero. But the output is 6,6,7. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the first and last non-zero cells in each row. Let's see:\n\n- Row 1: 0 + 0 = 0 \u2192 Output is 6. Doesn't match.\n- Row 2: 9 + 0 = 9 \u2192 Output is 6. Doesn't match.\n- Row 3: 9 + 0 = 9 \u2192 Output is 0. Doesn't match.\n- Row 4: 9 + 0 = 9 \u2192 Output is 5. Doesn't match.\n- Row 5: 0 + 0 = 0 \u2192 Output is 7. Doesn't match.\n- Row 6: ... and so on.\n\nThis doesn't work either.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sum of the first and last non-zero cells in each row, but if the first and last are zeros, it's the sum of the first and last that's non-zero. For example, in row 2, the last non-zero is 9, so 9 +", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 7\n0 5 7\n4 4 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 7 5 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n6 2 2\n7 5 7\n3 3 3\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 1\n1 5 2\n9 9 2\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

There are three examples provided, and I need to analyze them to deduce the rule.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input grid has a lot of zeros except for some rows and columns filled with numbers. The output grid also has zeros and some non-zero values. I think the rule might involve counting the occurrences of a certain number or position.\n\nIn the first few rows of Example 1, there are 6s, 7, and 5s in the output. These numbers appear in different parts of the grid. Maybe each number in the output corresponds to a specific position or a certain value in the input grid.\n\nI notice that in the first row of Example 1, the output has 6 and 6, which are the same. That might mean that a particular position is always mapped to a specific value, like the last column or something. Similarly, the second row has 0, 5, 7; maybe the middle column is involved.\n\nThe third row of Example 1 has 4, 4, 0. This could indicate that the same logic applies to multiple cells, perhaps related to their positions or values.\n\nComparing Example 2 and Example 3, the rules seem consistent. The output values are a mix of zeros and specific numbers, which likely correspond to the input grid's certain elements or their positions.\n\nSo, the rule might involve the last column of the input grid. Each number in the output is derived from the last column's value, with some exceptions like the first column being replaced with zeros or remaining as is.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the rule is to take the last column of each row in the input grid. If the last column is non-zero, it becomes the output value. If it's zero, the output is zero. But wait, in Example 1, the first row of the output has two 6s, which are non-zero. That fits because the last column has 6 in those rows.\n\nIn Example 2, the first output row is 6, 2, 2. The last column has 6, 0, 0, etc., so the non-zero values are taken. Similarly, the second output row has 7, 5, 7, which are from the last column.\n\nSo, the common rule is to take the last column of the input grid and assign each value to the corresponding output position. If the last column's value is zero, the output position remains zero.

My task is to find out what the rule that transforms the input into the output is, and then apply that rule to another input table to get the corresponding output.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the input and the output. Let me look at the examples provided and see if I can spot a pattern or figure out what operation is being done.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, all zeros input gives all zeros output. That's straightforward.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, so in the input, all zeros except the first few positions, but the output has a 1 in some positions.\n\nHmm, maybe the output is related to the input in terms of 1s and 0s. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the first column, input is 0, output is 0. Second column, input is 0, output is 0. Wait, but in row 2, input is 0s except for the first five positions: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which outputs to 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nWait, that suggests that the output in example 2 is mostly the same as input, except that the first 0 becomes 0, the next four 0s become 1s, and the rest 0s stay 0.\n\nWait, that seems to be inconsistent. Let me check the fourth row:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, same as input.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to the previous outputs. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, so the output is mostly 0s except for a 4 in the 4th position. Does that correspond to something?\n\nLooking at the input in example 3, it's all 0s, except the first few positions. But in the output, it's mostly 0s, except for a 4 at position 4. Hmm, perhaps the 4s are indicating the count of 1s in the input? Or maybe something else.\n\nWait, maybe it's related to the number of 1s in the input. Let's check example 3.\n\nIn example 3, all input is 0s. So, how does it result in a 4? Maybe it's a special case.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to count the number of 1s in the input and output that number in specific positions. Let me test that.\n\nIn example 1: input has 0s, so number of 1s is 0. Output has 0s, which matches.\n\nIn example 2: input has 1s in the first four positions. So, number of 1s is 5. But in the output, the first four positions are 1s. Wait, maybe it's the number of 1s in the output.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's the reverse: the input's 1s are in the output's positions.\n\nWait, example 2: input has 1s in positions 7-11, which are the output's 1s. So that seems consistent.\n\nSimilarly, example 3: input is all 0s, so output's 4 is in the first position. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, example 4:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, same as input. So, no change.\n\nAnother example is Example 5:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput is same as input.\n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps the rule is that in the output, the positions where the input had 1s are set to some value, and the rest are 0s.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput had 1s in positions 7-11, and in output, those positions are 1s, others are 0s.\n\nSimilarly, example 3: input had 1s in position 13, and output is 1 in position 4.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe it's more complicated. Let's try to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at example 4, input is all 0s, output is all 0s. So, nothing.\n\nIn example 1, all 0s \u2192 all 0s.\n\nIn example 2, 1s in 7-11 \u2192 1s in output 7-11, others 0.\n\nIn example 3, 1 in position 13 \u2192 output 4 is 4.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each 1 in the input, the output has a corresponding 1 in the output, but the counts vary.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is a certain pattern where every 4th position has a 0, and the rest have 0s, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at example 3 output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm, so 4 is in position 9.\n\nWait, the input in example 3 was all 0s, so perhaps the rule is that the output's 9th position is a 4.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is related to the number of 1s in the input. Let me see.\n\nIn example 2, the input had 5 ones (positions 7-11), but the output only had 4 ones. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in example 2, the output is mostly 0s, except for 1s in positions 7-11. So, the number of 1s in input is 5, but output has 4.\n\nWait, maybe it's the number of 1s in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of 1s in the input minus something. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at the output of example 4.\n\nIn example 4, input is all 0s, output is all 0s. So, no change.\n\nIn example 5, same as input.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in the output, each 4th position is a 4, and others are 0s.\n\nWait, in example 2, the output is mostly 0s except for 1s in positions 7-11.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the output has a 4 in position 4, which is the 4th position.\n\nWait, but looking at example 3, that would mean the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, which matches.\n\nSo, maybe for example 3, only the 4th position is 4, others are 0.\n\nBut then, in example 2, the first four positions are 1s, which are the 1s in the input. So, maybe there's a specific rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is a bitwise operation.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the result of a transformation where each 1 in the input is replaced by 1 in the output, but in a specific pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a convolution, but looking at the output patterns, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the number of 1s in each window of the input.\n\nWait, maybe it's a sliding window of size N, where N is fixed.\n\nBut without seeing the input and output in another way, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by replacing each 1 with 1 and each 0 with 0, but also considering the number of 1s.\n\nWait, but that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a specific pattern where the 4th position has a 4, and others are 0.\n\nWait, but in example 2, the output has 1s in the first four positions, which are the input's 1s.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's time to think about the first example where all inputs are 0, output is all 0s. So, perhaps the rule is for 1s.\n\nIn example 2, the input has 1s in positions 7-11, and output has 1s in those same positions.\n\nIn example 3, the input has a 1 in position 13, and output has a 4 in position 4.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the output is the sum of the input's positions, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is the number of 1s in each window.\n\nWait, in example 2, input has 5 1s, and output has 4 1s.\n\nWait, but in example 3, input has 1 1, output has 1 1.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the count of 1s in the input, but that would be 5 in example 2 and 1 in example 3, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the rule is that in the output, each 4th position has a 4, and the rest are 0s, except for the 1s in the input.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, example 2's output has 1s in the first four positions, which are the input's 1s.\n\nIn example 3, the output has 4 in position 4, which is the same as input's 13.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that each 1 in the input is replaced by a 1 in the output's 4th position, and the rest are 0.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic and doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a specific pattern where 4s are placed in certain positions based on the input.\n\nWait, given that in example 4, input is all 0s, output is all 0s. In example 5, input is all 0s, output is all 0s. So, perhaps the rule is that when the input has 1s, the output has a 4 in the 4th position.\n\nBut in example 2, the first four positions are 1s, which are the input's 1s, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each 1 in the input, the output's corresponding 4th position is set to 1, and the rest are 0.\n\nIn example 2, input has 5 1s, so the output's 4 positions are 1s, but in example 2, the output's 4th position is 1, but the first four positions are 1s. So, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the output is 1 in the 4th position, and all other positions are 0.\n\nBut in example 3, the output's 4th position is 4, which is in the 4th position. So, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the output is a 1 in the 4th position, and the rest are 0s, unless there are 1s in the input.\n\nWait, but in example 2, the output has 1s in the first four positions, which are the input's 1s. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider that the rule is based on the number of 1s in the input. Let me see.\n\nIn example 1, input has 0s, so 0 ones. Output has 0s.\n\nIn example 2, input has 5 ones. Output has 4 ones.\n\nIn example 3, input has 1 one. Output has 1 one.\n\nIn example 4, input has 0 ones. Output has 0 ones.\n\nIn example 5, input has 0 ones. Output has 0 ones.\n\nSo, maybe the rule is that for each 1 in the input, if the input has an odd number of 1s, then the output has a 4 in the 4th position, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the number of 1s in the input, but that's inconsistent with example 2 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 1s in the input, but in example 2, the output has 4 ones instead of 5.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the sum of the input's 1s.\n\nWait, in example 2, sum is 5, output is 4. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a transformation based on the position of the 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the count of 1s in the first four positions, and the rest are 0s.\n\nIn example 2, the first four positions are 1s, so count is 4, but the output's 4th position is 1. So that would be 4 ones, but the output has only 4 ones.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, let's think about the rules leading to the outputs.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput has 1s in positions 7-11 (indices 6 to 10, assuming 0-based).\n\nOutput has 1s in the same positions (positions 7-11).\n\nSo, 5 ones.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput has 1 in position 13 (index 12).\n\nOutput has 4 in position 4 (index 3).\n\nSo, maybe it's a mapping where the first 1 in the input becomes a 4, others remain 0.\n\nWait, but in example 2, the first four positions are 1s, so perhaps the rule is that for each 1 in the input, the output's 4th position is set to 1, and others are 0.\n\nBut then, in example 2, the first four positions are 1s, so the output's 4th position is 1, and the first four positions are also 1s. That suggests that's not the case.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should try to find a general rule that can explain all the examples.\n\nLooking at the output, perhaps it's structured as follows:\n\nOutput has 0s in certain positions except where the input has 1s.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput has 1s in positions 7-11, and output has 1s in those same positions, others are 0.\n\nIn example 3:\n\nInput has a 1 in position 13, which in output is in position 4.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the rule is that for each 1 in the input, the output's 4th position is set to 1.\n\nWait, but in example 2, the output has 1s in the first four positions, which are the input's 1s. So, that's consistent.\n\nIn example 3, the input has 1 in position 13, so output's 4th position is 4.\n\nWait, so maybe it's a bit more involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the 4th position is the count of 1s in the input, but that's not consistent with the examples.\n\nExample 2: input has 5 1s, output's 4th position is 1, which is not 5.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for another approach.\n\nLet me think about the output of example 3:\n\nInput has 1 in position 13, output has 4 in position 4.\n\nWait, that's a bit of a coincidence but perhaps the rule is that the 4th position is the value of the 13th position, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the output's 4th position is 4, regardless of input.\n\nBut that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the 4th position is the sum of all 1s in the input.", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples

Let me take a look at the examples given to understand what's happening.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input and output are both 20 numbers long. The input has a bunch of 0s and a single 1. The output seems to have 0s and a 4 somewhere. Wait, maybe it's showing the differences between the input and output? Or perhaps it's a transformation where 1s indicate something.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is a 20-element array with some 4s and 1s, and the output has 0s and some 1s. It looks like the output is the input after some operation. Hmm.\n\nLet me see Example 3. The input is similar to the first one but with more 0s and 4s. The output also has more 1s and 4s. It seems like the output is modifying the input in a specific way, perhaps using bitwise operations or some kind of transformation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about how the output is derived from the input. Let's consider the first example:\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput seems to have four 0s where the input had 1s. Wait, but in the output, maybe it's the difference between the input and something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input but with certain positions filled in a specific way. Like, the first few output elements are 0s, then a bunch of 0s, then some 1s and 4s. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 4, the input and output are both 20 elements but with more varied numbers. The input has 4s, 0s, and 1s. The output seems to be a more complicated mix of 0s and 1s and 4s. It might be the result of some kind of transformation on the input.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is a row-wise operation. Like, for each row in the input, replace some elements with others. But looking at the inputs and outputs, it's not exactly clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a bitwise operation, like a lookup table. Each element in the input maps to a corresponding element in the output.\n\nWait, let's look at Example 1 again. The input is all 0s and one 1. The output is all 0s but has a 4 where the input had 1? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, no. The output in Example 1 is all 0s, but the input is mostly 0s and one 1. So maybe the function is something like subtracting 1 from the 1 in the input. But that would give 0, which matches the output. But let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 4, 0, and 1s. The output has 0s and 1s. If the 4 was considered as a 1, then perhaps it was turned into 0. But that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's a bitwise OR operation. For example, in Example 3, the input had a 1 in position 5. The output seems to have 1s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matrix where each row is transformed, and the first row in the input maps to the first row in the output, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at the output in Example 1 more carefully.\n\nInput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the 1s in the input are replaced with 0s in the output. But in the output, there are also some 4s. Maybe the function is replacing 1s with 0s and something else with 4s.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output is all 0s. So maybe the function is turning 1s into 0s and leaving 0s as is.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output has a 1. Maybe the function isn't just replacing 1s with 0s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a bitwise operation where 1 is treated as something else. Like, maybe it's a bitwise OR with another constant.\n\nWait, another way: looking at the output in Example 1: when the input has a 1, the output has a 0. But in Example 4, the output has 1s in certain positions where the input has 1s. So it's not just replacing 1s with 0s.\n\nWait, maybe it's more like the output is the input with all the non-zero elements or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a transformation where each element is set to 0 if it's 1, and some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is taking the input and creating an output where each element is the sum of the elements in the input.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 15 1s and 4 0s, total 19. Output is 0, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is multiplying each element by some factor, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output: all zeros. That suggests that the function is perhaps zeroing out the input.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output has 1s, so that can't be.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at specific transformations.\n\nLet me consider each element in the input and output to see what's happening.\n\nFor the first element in the input (0) in the output: 0.\n\nSecond element: 0.\n\n... until the 10th element, which is 1 in the input but 0 in the output.\n\nWait, but in the output, the 1s are spread out. So maybe it's not just about 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a transformation that turns 1s into 4s and 0s into 0s, but that doesn't fit the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each element in the output is the sum of the input elements or something.\n\nWait, in Example 1:\n\nInput sum: 15*1 +4*1=19. Output is 0. So sum is replaced with 0.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput has 4, 0, and 1s. Sum is 5. Output has 1, 0, 0, etc. Hmm, doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a bitwise operation where 1s become 4s, and 0s stay as 0s.\n\nIn Example1: all 1s become 0s. So perhaps 1 \u2192 0 and 4 \u2192 4.\n\nIn Example2: the input has 4,0,1. Output has 1,0,0. So 4 \u21921, 1\u21920.\n\nIn Example3: the input has 4s and 1s. Output has 0s and 4s. So maybe 1\u21924? Or 4\u21924, 1\u21920?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Example1:\n\nInput: 1 in 11,12,13,14,15 \u2192 output 0,0,0,0,0.\n\nIn Example2:\n\nInput: 4 in positions 0,10,14; 1 in position 4.\n\nOutput: 1 in position 0; 0s elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not a sum or a transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input with 1s and 4s replaced with something.\n\nLooking at Example3's input and output:\n\nInput:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput pattern matches the input pattern where 0s become 0s, 1s become 4s, 4s remain 4s. Wait, in Example 3, the input has 4s in certain positions. The output has 4s in those positions as well. So perhaps the function is replacing 0s with 0s, 4s with 4s, and 1s with 4s? No, because in Example 1, 1 becomes 0. But in Example 3, 1s are present in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is a rotation or some transformation on the positions.\n\nWait, looking back at the Output and Input correspondence:\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput: ... 1s ...\nOutput: all 0s.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput: ... 4 at position 0, 1 at 4, 0 at others.\nOutput: 1 at position 0, others 0.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput has 4s in some positions, 1s in others.\nOutput has 4s in those positions, 0s elsewhere.\n\nSo perhaps the function is taking each element in the input and replacing it with the same value if it's 4, and 0 if it's 1. But that's not what's happening because in Example 1, the output for position 15 is 0, but the input has 4 there.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a lookup table where 1 \u2192 0, 4 \u2192 4, 0 \u21920. So, the output has the same values as the input, but 1 is replaced with 0 and 4 remains 4.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 0s, which matches the input's 1s being replaced with 0s.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1s (which would be replaced with 0s), but the output has 0s in those places. The input also has 4s, which remain 4s, and 1s replaced with 0s.\n\nIn Example3, the input has 4s and 1s, and the output has 4s and 0s where the input had 1s.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each element in the input, if it is 1, output 0; if it is 4, output 4; else, output the same value.\n\nSo, the function is f(x) = x if x is 0 or 4, else 0.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nIn Example1:\n\nInput element is 1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nYes, which matches the output being all 0s.\n\nIn Example2:\n\nInput has 4 at position 0 \u2192 output 4.\n\nInput has 1 at position 4 \u2192 output 0.\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nIn Example3:\n\nInput has 4s and 1s. Output has 4s and 0s where the input had 1s.\n\nSo yes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, the function is f(x) = x if x is 0 or 4, else 0.\n\nBut wait, in the Output, the 4s remain 4s. So, yes, f(x)=x when x is 0 or 4, else 0.\n\nSo now, the task is to apply this function to each element", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the

Let me start by looking at the examples to see how the inputs map to outputs.\n\nFirst example:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm, so all zeros. That's straightforward.\n\nSecond example:\nInput:\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nWait, so the first element of the input is 4, and it becomes 0 in the output. The next six elements are 0, and they all become 1s. Then the rest are 1s. So maybe the rule is that if a 4 is present in a certain position, it gets transformed into 0; otherwise, it becomes 1.\n\nLooking at the third example:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSame as the first example. All zeros.\n\nFourth example:\nInput:\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo similar structure. The third element is 4, which becomes 0. The next six elements are 0s, which become 1s. The rest are 1s.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like whenever a 4 is in a certain position, it gets turned into 0, and all other values are turned into 1s.\n\nLooking at the fifth example:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSame as the first.\n\nSixth example:\nInput:\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0\n\nWait, so the third element is 4, which becomes 0, and the rest are 0s becoming 0 as well. So maybe the rule is that any 4 in a certain position is replaced by 0, and all other numbers are replaced by 0 as well? But in the sixth example, the output after 4 is 0, but in the output, it's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0.\n\nWait, so maybe it's that any 4 is replaced by 0, and other numbers are 0? But in the fifth example, the input is all zeros, and output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut in the third example, input is zeros, output is zeros. Hmm, maybe the rule is that whenever a 4 is present in a certain position, it's replaced with 0; otherwise, it remains as is. But in the second example, the input has a 4 in the first position, and the output has 0 in the first position. So maybe that's the rule.\n\nLet me check the third example:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo no 4s, so no transformation, same as input and output.\n\nFourth example:\nInput has a 4 in position 3, and output has 0 in position 3.\n\nFifth example:\nInput all zeros, output all zeros. So no 4s transformed into 0s.\n\nSixth example:\nInput has 4 in position 3, so output has 0 in position 3, and the rest are 0s, which remain 0s. But in the output, it's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0. So the 4 becomes 0, but the rest are 0s, which stay as 0s. So maybe it's that any 4 is replaced by 0, and other numbers remain the same.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the third example where input was zeros, output was zeros. So maybe the rule is that whenever a 4 is present in a certain position, it's replaced by 0; otherwise, it's left as is.\n\nLooking back at the first examples, the first example is all zeros, output is all zeros. Second example: input has 4 in first position, output has 0 in first position; the rest are 0 in input and 1s in output.\n\nThird example: all zeros, output all zeros.\n\nFourth example: input has 4 in position 3, output has 0 in position 3; the rest are 0s in input and 1s in output.\n\nWait, so maybe the rule is that any 4 in a certain position is replaced by 0, and all other numbers are replaced by 0 or 1?\n\nWait, no, output in the second example is all 1s, except for the first position, which is 0. So perhaps the rule is that the 4 is replaced by 0, and all other numbers are replaced by 0s.\n\nWait, but in the third example, all input is 0s, so output is 0s.\n\nIn the fourth example, input has 4 in position 3, output has 0 in position 3; the rest are 0 in input and 1 in output.\n\nIn the fifth example, same as first.\n\nIn the sixth example, input has 4 in position 3, output has 0 in position 3; the rest are 0s, which stay 0s.\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that whenever a 4 is in a certain position, it's replaced by 0; all other elements are replaced by 0.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the output is all 1s except for the first position, which is 0. So that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's that any 4 in a certain position is replaced by 0, and all other numbers are replaced by 0. But that's not matching the second example.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that the input array is replaced by a 0 in the position of the 4, and 0 in all other positions, but the rest of the positions are 0, except maybe the same as before.\n\nWait, let me think: perhaps the rule is that whenever a 4 is present in a certain position, it's replaced by 0, and all other numbers are replaced by 0. But in the second example, the only 4 is in position 1, which is replaced by 0, and the rest are 0s, but the output is all 1s except for the first position, which is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's that the 4 is replaced by 0, and all other numbers are either 0 or 1, but that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the examples again.\n\nIn the second example, the input is:\n\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo the 4 is in position 0, becomes 0. The 1s are in positions 9-15, which become 1. The rest are 0s.\n\nSo the rule might be: the 4 is replaced by 0, and all other elements are 1 or 0 as per the input.\n\nWait, but in the third example, input is all zeros, so output is all zeros.\n\nIn the fourth example, input has a 4 in position 3, so output has 0 in position 3; the rest are 0 in input and 1 in output.\n\nIn the sixth example, input has a 4 in position 3, output has 0 in position 3; the rest are 0s, which stay 0.\n\nWait, so maybe the rule is: if a 4 is present in a certain position, it's replaced by 0; otherwise, each element is replaced by 0 or 1. But in the fourth example, the input's 4 is replaced by 0, but the rest of the elements are 0 in input, and 1 in output.\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that any 4 in a certain position is replaced by 0, and all other numbers are replaced by 0 or 1 based on their value.\n\nWait, but in the fourth example, the input's 4 is in position 3, output's position 3 is 0. The input's other 1s are in positions 9-15, output's those positions are 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the 4 is replaced by 0, and all other elements are replaced by 0 or 1, but that doesn't explain why in the fourth example, the 1s in the input become 1s in the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that the 4 is replaced by 0, and all other elements are replaced by 0, but in the fourth example, the other elements were 0s, which stay 0, and 1s, which stay 1.\n\nWait, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the 4 is replaced by 0, and all other elements are replaced by 0, but in the second example, the 4 is replaced by 0, but the other elements are 0, which remain 0 in output.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about how the input is transformed into the output. Let's look at the fourth example:\n\nInput:\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 4 in position 3 becomes 0. The other 0s remain 0. So perhaps the rule is that whenever a 4 is present in a certain position, it's replaced by 0, and all other elements are left as is.\n\nBut in the second example, the 4 in position 1 becomes 0, and the other 1s become 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to see what the rule is from the examples.\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\nFirst example: All zeros, output all zeros.\n\nSecond example: 4 in position 0, output 0 in position 0; other positions 0 become 1s.\n\nThird example: All zeros, same as input and output.\n\nFourth example: 4 in position 3, output 0 in position 3; other positions 0s become 1s.\n\nFifth example: All zeros, same as input and output.\n\nSixth example: 4 in position 3, output 0 in position 3; other positions 0s remain 0, and 1s remain 1s.\n\nWait, so perhaps when a 4 is present in a certain position (like the first few positions), it's replaced by 0, and all other elements are replaced by 1s. But in the fourth example, it's position 3, and the other 1s become 1s.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that whenever a 4 is in a certain position, it's replaced by 0, and all other elements are replaced by 1s except that 0s stay 0.\n\nBut in the second example, the 4 is in position 1, which is replaced by 0, and the rest of the 1s become 1s.\n\nIn the fourth example, the 4 is replaced by 0, and the other 0s become 1s.\n\nIn the sixth example, the 4 is replaced by 0, and the other 0s remain 0, and the 1s remain 1s.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So the rule is: for a certain position, whenever it's a 4, it's replaced by 0; all other elements are replaced by 1s if their value is 1, otherwise, 0.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the 1s are in the input, and the output is 1s, so that fits.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the 4 is in position 0, and the rest of the elements are 0s, which stay 0s except for the 1s.\n\nWait, no, in the second example, the rest of the input is 0s except for the 1s in positions 9-15, which become 1s in the output. So the rule is that the 4 is replaced by 0, and all other elements are replaced by 1s.\n\nIn the fourth example, the 4 is replaced by 0, and the other 0s become 1s, but 1s become 1s.\n\nIn the sixth example, the 4 is replaced by 0, the 1s remain 1s, and the 0s remain 0s.\n\nSo, this suggests that the rule is: in a certain position, any 4 is replaced by 0; all other elements are replaced by 1 if they are 1, else 0.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the 1s are in the input, and in the output, they are 1s. So the 1s remain 1s, which suggests that in that position, 1s are 1s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: any 4 in a certain position is replaced by 0; in all other elements, elements that are 1s remain 1s, others remain 0.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the 1s are 1s. So perhaps the rule is that in that position, 4 is replaced by 0, and others are 1s if they are 1s, else 0.\n\nSo, more formally: For a certain position (maybe position 0?), whenever a 4 appears, it becomes 0. All other elements are 1 if their original value is 1, else 0.\n\nWait, but in the fourth example, the 4 is at position 3, and the other 0s become 1s, which matches.\n\nIn the sixth example, the 4 is at position 3, and the other elements are 0s and 1s, which stay the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that in a certain position, any 4 is replaced by 0, and all other elements are replaced by 1 if they are 1, else 0.\n\nBut in the second example, that would mean the 1s are replaced by 1s, which matches the output.\n\nWait, let me see: the second example's input has 4 in position 0, output has 0 there. Other elements are 0s in input and 1s in output. So, maybe that's the rule.\n\nBut let's check the fourth example: input has 4 in position 3, output has 0 there. Other elements are 0s in input, which become 0s in output, which matches.\n\nIn the sixth example: input has 4 in position 3, output has 0 there. Other elements are 0s in input, which stay 0s, and 1s in input become 1s in output.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the 1s are 1s. So perhaps the rule is: in the position where 4 is, it's replaced by 0; in all other positions, if the element is 1, it remains 1; if it's 0, it remains 0.\n\nSo the rule is: for a certain position, 4 becomes 0; others remain the same.\n\nBut how is that rule", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0

Let me start by understanding the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input is a 30x30 grid filled with 0s and 4s, and the output is another 30x30 grid that's mostly 0s except for some 4s in certain positions. The input seems to have a pattern where 4s are placed in diagonal lines, and the output also has 4s in similar positions but not in the same 3x3 squares. Hmm, wait, maybe it's about overlapping patterns or diagonals.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is this grid that's 30x30, and the output is also 30x30 with 0s and 0s in some places and 4s in others. I notice that in Output 2, there are 0s in the first row, except for some 4s in the last few rows and columns. So, maybe the rule is that certain diagonals and lines in the input result in 4s in the output, but other parts remain 0.\n\nMoving on to Example 3, the input is again mostly 0s and 4s, but the output seems to have more 4s in spots that were 0s in the input. So, perhaps when the input has 4s, the output is also 4s in those positions, and when the input has 0s, the output stays 0s. But wait, in the output, there are 0s in the input's last row, so maybe the rule is more nuanced.\n\nNow, let's look at the actual input and output grids to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the first row of Input and Output from Example 1: Input has 1s, and Output has 0s. Maybe when the input has a 1, the output doesn't have a 4, but in the output, it's 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the rule is that if the input has a 4, the output has a 4, and anything else remains 0. But in the first example, the input has 1s and 4s, and the output has 0s and 4s in certain places. Maybe it's more about overlapping patterns.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1, the output has 0s in the first row and 4s in the diagonal. So maybe when the input has 4s, the output has 4s, but other cells remain 0. But in the input of Example 1, the first row is all 1s, so it's 0s in the output. Hmm, maybe the rule is that the output is the input with 0s where the input had 1s, but that doesn't explain the 4s.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the diagonals. For instance, in Input 1, the first row is 1s, and the output is 0s. Maybe when a diagonal has a 4, the output has a 4 in the center. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Output 1, the first row is 0s. Maybe the rule is that in the first row, whenever there's a 1 in the input, the output is 0. But that doesn't hold because in Input 1, the first row is 1s, and Output is 0s, but in Output 1, the first row is 0s.\n\nWait, looking at the first row of Output 1, it's all 0s. Input 1 starts with 1s, so maybe the rule is that in the first row, if the input has a 4, the output has a 4, else 0. But in the output, the first row is all 0s, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is about diagonals. Let's see: in Input 1, the first row is 1s, so maybe when the input has a 4 on the diagonal, the output has a 4. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that in the 3x3 grids in the input, if a certain pattern exists, then the corresponding cell in the output is 4. But that's too vague.\n\nWait, maybe thinking about the examples, the outputs seem to have 4s in the positions where the diagonals in the input have 4s. For example, in the first row of Input 1, which is all 1s, the first output is all 0s. But in Output 1, the first row is all 0s, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at the second row of Output 1, it's all 4s: 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Hmm, that's 4s in the fourth position and the fifth? Or maybe that's a diagonal.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that whenever a 4 is in a position that is on a certain diagonal of the input, the output is 4, else 0. But that requires more testing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a rule that every time there's a 4 in the input, the output is a 4, but that doesn't explain the positions.\n\nWait, looking at the input and output of Example 1, perhaps the rule is that in the output, for every position that is a 4 in the input, the output is a 4, but only if the position is on a certain diagonal or in a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is about the product of the diagonals. For example, for each cell, if the sum of its row and column is even, then it's 4, else 0. But that would require more experimentation.\n\nWait, let me think about the first row of Output 1: 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nIn the first row of Input 1, all are 1s. So, if the rule is that when the sum of row and column is even, the cell is 4, but that would mean in a 3x3 grid, but I think the rule is per cell.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that each cell in the output is determined by the product of the cell's row and column in the input. If the product is even, output is 4, else 0. But in the first row, all are 1s, so that would be 0s, but in Output 1, the first row is all 0s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let me check the output of Example 1 more carefully.\n\nOutput 1:\n\n0 0

Let's see what the input and output look like.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input is a 10x20 grid where 1s are present, and the output is another 10x20 grid with 4s and 0s. Similarly, the second example shows input and output.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a transformation where, for each row, the 1s are replaced with 4s and 0s are replaced with something else. Or maybe it's some kind of thresholding.\n\nWait, let me consider the first example. The input has a lot of 1s and some 0s. The output seems to have 4s where the input had 1s and 0s elsewhere. Maybe it's replacing the 1s with 4s and 0s with 0s.\n\nBut in the examples, the output has 0s only in certain places. For instance, in the first input, the output starts with 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So it's replacing some 1s with higher numbers.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps it's a digit representation. Looking at the numbers in the output, they seem to be 0,1,4,1,1,1 etc. So perhaps it's a way to represent numbers using 0s, 1s, and 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a form of the original numbers being represented in a different way.\n\nWait, looking at the input and output, perhaps each number is being represented in a way that 1 becomes 4 and 0 remains 0. So 1 \u2192 4, 0 \u2192 0. But in the first example, the input has some 1s, and the output has 4s. So that might be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a transformation where each 1 is replaced with a 4 and 0s become something else. Or maybe it's the opposite: 4s become something, and 1s become something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a kind of encoding where higher numbers are represented as 4s and lower numbers remain as 0s or 1s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a transformation where each number is replaced by its value plus 3. For example, 0 \u2192 3, 1 \u2192 4.\n\nBut let me check the examples:\n\nIn the first example, in the last row of input, 0s are present, and in output, 0s are present. But in other rows, 1s in the input become 4s in output.\n\nWait, for example, in the input:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nand so on.\n\nThe outputs for each row are:\n\nFirst output row:\n0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, for each row, the 1s in the input are replaced with 4s in the output. 0s stay as 0s.\n\nWait, but in the first input row, all 0s, so output row is all 0s.\n\nBut in the second input row (which is all 1s), the output is 0 1 4 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So, it's 1\u21924, 0\u21920.\n\nWait, but this would suggest that the transformation is replacing 1s with 4s and 0s with 0s.\n\nBut then, looking at another example: input row 3: 0s everywhere. Output row is all 0s.\n\nInput row 4: 0s everywhere.

My task is to find a rule that transforms the input into the output. Let me start by understanding both grids.\n\nLooking at the examples given, I see that each input corresponds to an output. The first example has an input of all zeros except for a few 1s, and the output shows corresponding changes. The second example has inputs with a lot of 0s and some 0.5s, and outputs with similar patterns. The third example has a mix of 0s, 0.5s, and 1s. The fourth example is similar but with more varied numbers.\n\nI notice that in all examples, the output seems to have 0s in places where the input has 0s, and 1s or 0.5s where the input has 1s or 0.5s. That makes me think the rule might involve some kind of threshold or condition where if the input is >= some value, the output is 1, else it's 0.\n\nLooking closer, in the first input, there are 0s, but the output has 0s where the input has 0s, and 1s where the input has 1s. So maybe the rule is that if the input is 1, output is 1; else, 0. But let's check other examples.\n\nIn the second input, some entries are 0.5. The output shows 0s there as well. So maybe it's not just 1s and 0s. Wait, in the second example, the output grid has 0s where the input is 0.5. Hmm, that doesn't fit the 1-0 idea.\n\nLet me look at the third example. The input has 0s and 1s, and the output has 0s, 1s, and 0.5s. So perhaps the rule isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is based on the input having a 1 or 0.5. Let me see the outputs.\n\nIn the first sample input, the output has 0s where the input has 0s, 1s where the input has 1s, and 0.5s where the input has 0.5s.\n\nBut looking at the second sample input, which is similar but has 0.5s and 0s, the output has 0s where input has 0s, 1s where input has 1s, and 1s where input has 0.5s.\n\nIn the third sample, input has 0s, 1s, and 1s, but output has 0s, 1s, and 0.5s.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if the input is 1 or 0.5, output is 1; else, 0. But let's check.\n\nIn the first sample input, output has 0s where input has 0s, 1s where input has 1s, and 0.5s where input has 0.5s. So that fits that rule.\n\nIn the second sample input, the output has 0s where input has 0s, 1s where input has 1s, and 1s where input has 0.5s. So that also fits.\n\nIn the third sample input, the output has 0s where input has 0s, 1s where input has 1s, and 0.5s where input has 1s. So that fits too.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The third sample input has some 0.5s and 1s. The output has 0.5s where input has 1s, 0.5s where input has 0.5s, and 0s where input has 0s. So that also fits.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: if the input is 1 or 0.5, output is 1; else, 0.\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the output has 0.5s where input has 0.5s. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each cell, if the input is 1 or 0.5, output is 1; else, output is 0.\n\nBut looking back at the first sample input, the output has 0s where the input has 0s, 1s where input has 1s, and 0.5s where input has 0.5s. That fits.\n\nBut let me test with another example. Let's take the second sample input where the output has 1s where input has 1s and 0.5s where input has 0.5s. It also has 0.5s where input has 0s.\n\nYes, that fits.\n\nThird sample input: output has 0s where input has 0s, 1s where input has 1s, and 0.5s where input has 0.5s.\n\nFourth sample input: output has 0s where input has 0s, 1s where input has 1s, 0.5s where input has 0.5s, and 4s where input has 4s.\n\nWait, but 4s aren't 1 or 0.5, so output is 0. So that seems consistent.\n\nWait, in the first sample input, the output has 0.5s where input has 0.5s, correct.\n\nAnother case: in the second sample input, the output has 1s where input has 1s, 0.5s where input has 0.5s, and 0s where input has 0s. So that's consistent.\n\nThird sample input: output has 0s where input has 0s, 1s where input has 1s, 0.5s where input has 0.5s.\n\nFourth sample input: 0s where input has 0s, 1s where input has 1s, 0.5s where input has 0.5s, and 0s where input has 4s.\n\nSo, it seems that the rule is: output is 1 if the input is 1 or 0.5, else 0.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the second sample input, the output has 1s where input has 1s, 0.5s where input has 0.5s, and 0s where input has 0s.\n\nSo, if the input is 1 or 0.5, output is 1; else, 0.\n\nYes, so that's the rule I think.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each cell, if the input value is 1 or 0.5, output is 1; else, output is 0.\n\nTherefore, to transform the input to the output, each cell is replaced by 1 if the input is 1 or 0.5, else 0.\n\nSo, applying that rule to the first input example.\n\nIn the first example input, the output has 0s where input has 0s, 1s where input has 1s, and 0.5s where input has 0.5s.\n\nWhich fits the rule.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with that rule.\n\nNow, to implement this, I need to create a rule that takes the input grid and replaces each cell with 1 if the input is 1 or 0.5, else 0.\n\nSo, for each cell, the output is 1 if input is 1 or 0.5, else 0.\n\nSo, the code needs to process each cell, and for each cell, output is 1 if input is 1 or 0.5, else 0.\n\nSo, the rule is a simple conditional: output = 1 if input == 1 or input == 0.5, else 0.\n\nNow, the user provided four examples, and I think the rule holds for all of them.\n\nSo, given that, the rule is as above.\n\nTherefore, the output is built by applying this rule to each cell.\n\nNow, the next step is to create the code.\n\nLooking at the examples, the code is given as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nInput:\n\nLet me see, the first line is 21 cells, but the user's code shows the input as 21 lines each with 21 numbers. Wait, looking back, the user provided the input as:\n\nThe user provided Input lines as:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, looking at the first line, it's 21 numbers, but the way it's presented is 21 lines with 21 numbers each. So, each line is 21 numbers. So, the first line is cell 0,0 to 20,20.\n\nBut perhaps the output is in the same indices.\n\nWait, maybe the user provided the input as 21 lines each with 21 numbers, but the actual input is 21x21 grid. So, perhaps the input is an array of 21x21 grids, but the user provided only one example.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think that the first input line is a row of 21 numbers, and the output is the corresponding row of the output.\n\nSo, for the first row in input, which is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output's first row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, so in the input, the first line has 1 at positions 9,10,11,12,13,14,15. The output has 0s in those positions, and 0 elsewhere. So, that fits.\n\nSimilarly, let me check another line.\n\nFor the second line in input:\n\n0 0 0 0 ", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the

Let me look at the examples and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm, so the input has a 4 followed by another 0. In the output, both of these are 0. So maybe the rule is that any 4 in the input is replaced by 0. Let me check if that holds.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput row: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 4 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHere, the input has a 4, and the output has a 1. So again, replacing the 4 with a 1. But wait, in the first example, the input has two 4s, and both are replaced with 0. So maybe the rule is that any 4 in the input is replaced with 0.\n\nLet me test that in Example 2. The input's 4 is replaced by 1. Wait, no, in Example 2, the output's 4 is still 4. So perhaps that's not the rule.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the input has a 4 and the output also has a 4, so maybe the 4s remain 4. Hmm, that conflicts with the earlier examples.\n\nWait, in Example 1, both 4s became 0. In Example 2, the input's 4 remained a 4. In Example 3, let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 3, I see an input line where there's a 4 in the output. Let me see:\n\nInput line (from Example 3): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nWait, no, that input had all 0s and a 4 at the end, which in output became 4. So in that case, the 4 remained as 4.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for a more systematic approach.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input had a 4 at the end, but the output also had 0. So maybe the 4 is replaced by 0.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input had a 4, and the output had a 1. So maybe the 4 is replaced by 1.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. How can a 4 be both replaced by 0 and 1? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong examples. Let me look at the last example to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nIn Example 4:\n\nInput row: 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input had a 4 in the third position, and the output has a 4 in the fourth position. So here, 4 was replaced by 4. That suggests that perhaps the 4s remain as 4s, and other numbers are transformed in a different way.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input had two 4s, but both were replaced by 0s. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 4 in the input is replaced by 0, but in the 4th example, the 4 was kept as 4.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet me try to see if the rule is about the sum of the digits or something else.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput sum: 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+4+0+0+0+0+4+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 8\nOutput sum: 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 0\nSo the sum went from 8 to 0. That suggests that the rule involves some kind of inversion, like 4 becomes 0 and 0 stays 0.\n\nIn Example 4:\n\nInput: sum is 0+0+4+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 4\nOutput: sum is 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+4+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 4\nSo sum remained the same, but 4 was transformed to 4.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if the digit is a 4, it's replaced by 0, otherwise it remains the same. But in Example 1, both 4s are replaced by 0. In Example 4, the 4 remains as 4. So that's consistent.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input had a 4 at the end, and the output had a 1. So that doesn't fit. Because in Example 2, the 4 was replaced by 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me re-examine Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n4 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, the 4 was preserved, and the 0 was turned into 1. So in the input, the 0 was replaced with 1. But in the first example, the 0s were replaced with 0s.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. How can a 0 be turned into 1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the first example, the 0s were turned into 0s, but the 4s were turned into 0s. In Example 2, the input had a 4, which remained a 4, and a 0, which became 1. So that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that 4s are replaced by 0s, and 0s are replaced by 1s, except when in certain positions. But that also doesn't fit with all examples.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the possible transformation for each digit.\n\nLooking at the input and output examples, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- Replace 4 with 0.\n\n- Replace 0 with 0.\n\nWait, but then why in Example 2, the 0 becomes 1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 4 is replaced with a 0.\n\nIn Example 4:\n\nInput: 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHere, the 4 is replaced with 0, and the 0 remains 0.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput: 4 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHere, the 4 is preserved, and the 0 is turned into 1.\n\nSo this suggests that only 4s are transformed to 0s, and 0s can be transformed to 1s or remain 0s.\n\nWait, but then in the first example, both 4s are turned to 0s.\n\nSo the rule might be:\n\n- Replace any 4 in the input with 0.\n\n- 0s are replaced with 0.\n\nBut then why in Example 2, the 0 becomes 1? That contradicts this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that 4s are replaced with 0s, and 0s are replaced with 0s.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, 0 becomes 1, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that 4s are replaced with 0s, and 0s are replaced with 0s, except when the digit is 0 in the output.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input had a 1, which is a 1, so it remains 1? But the output was all zeros. Wait, no, the input had a 1, which is a 1 in the input, but in the output, it's a 1.\n\nWait, no, the input had 1's in positions 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any 1 is a 1, any 4 is replaced with 0, and any 0 is replaced with 1.\n\nBut that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find a transformation that works for all given examples.\n\nLooking at the first example:\n\nInput has 4s, and the output has all 0s. So that suggests that any 4 is replaced with 0.\n\nSecond example: input has 4, output has 4. So 4 remains 4.\n\nThird example: input has 4, output has 0.\n\nFourth example: input has 0, output has 0.\n\nFifth example: all 0s, outputs all 0s.\n\nSixth example: input has 4 and 0, outputs 4 and 0.\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that if the digit is 4, it's replaced with 0. If the digit is 0, it's replaced with 0. If the digit is 1, it's replaced with 1.\n\nBut then in the first example, the input has 4s and 1s, which are replaced with 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any 4 is replaced with 0, and any 0 is replaced with 0.\n\nWait, but that's not the case in Example 2, where 0 becomes 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is: 4s become 0s, 0s become 0s, and 1s become 1s except when the input had a 4.\n\nBut that doesn't explain anything.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that in the output, every 4 is a 0, every 0 is a 0, and every 1 is a 1.\n\nBut that can't be because in the first example, the 4 is turned into 0, but 1s are turned into 0s.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.\n\nMaybe the rule is that any 4 in the input is replaced with 0, and all 0s are replaced with 0s. But in Example 2, the 0 becomes 1, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only 4s are replaced with 0s, and 0s are replaced with 0s, but 1s are preserved.\n\nBut in Example 2, the 0 becomes 1, so that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the data and try to find a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input has a 1, which in the output is a 0. So perhaps the 1 is replaced with 0.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput row:4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row:4 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 4 is unchanged, but the 0 becomes 1.\n\nSo that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0 becomes 1 when the 4 is in a certain position, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that 4s are replaced by 0s, 0s are replaced by 0s, and 1s are replaced by 1s unless the digit is 1 and the position is such that it's 0 in the input.\n\nBut that's too vague.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about this as a substitution problem where each digit is replaced by another digit based on some rule.\n\nLooking at the first example:\n\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the only change is that the 1s in the input are replaced with 0s.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput:4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:4 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 4 is unchanged, but the 0 becomes 1.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 4 is replaced with 0.\n\nIn Example 4:\n\nInput:0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 4 is replaced with 0.\n\nIn Example 5:\n\nInput:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nNo changes.\n\nIn Example 6:\n\nInput:4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ", 0.0], ["5",

Let me see what it's about.\n\nThe problem gives four examples of input and corresponding output. My goal is to find a rule that transforms the input into the output and then apply that rule to the given test input grid to generate the output.\n\nLet me look at the examples first. There are four examples, each with an input and output pair. I'll need to analyze these to figure out the pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm, looking at this, I can try to find a pattern. Let me think about the first few rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a bunch of 0s and a single 1 in the fifth row. The output for that row is 0. So, maybe when there's a 1 in the input, the output is 0.\n\nLooking at row 2, the input is 0s except for a 1 in the sixth column. The output is 0 as well. So, same as row 5.\n\nSimilarly, in row 3, the input has 0s except for a 1 in the seventh column. The output is 0.\n\nWait, but in the output, all these rows have 0s. Is that a pattern?\n\nLooking at the output, all the rows are 0. So whenever the input has a 1, the output is 0. But wait, no, in row 1, the input is all 0s, and the output is all 0s. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, in the input, row 1 is all 0s, so the output is all 0s. Similarly, rows 2-7 are all 0s except for 1s in the respective columns, but the output for these rows are 0s. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of 1s. Let me check.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output 0.\n\nInput row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output 0.\n\nInput row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 output 0.\n\nSo, in these rows, the input has 1s in the sixth, seventh, and eighth columns respectively, but the output is 0 in all these cases.\n\nWait, but in the output, all of these rows are 0. So, perhaps when the input has any 1, the output is 0.\n\nBut then, in the input, row 1 is all 0s, so output is 0.\n\nWait, maybe the output is related to some other pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the output, it's all zeros, which is confusing because in the examples, the output is not zero.\n\nWait, no, in the examples, the output is all zeros. But that can't be right because in the input grids, there are 1s.\n\nWait, so maybe the output is always zero, regardless of the input.\n\nBut that's not what's shown. Looking at the output grids:\n\nOutput 1: All rows are 0. So, no 1s.\n\nOutput 2: All rows have 0.\n\nOutput3: All rows are 0.\n\nOutput4: All rows are 0.\n\nOutput5: All rows are 0.\n\nOutput6: All rows are 0.\n\nOutput7: All rows are 0.\n\nOutput8: All rows are 0.\n\nWait, that can't be. So, when the input has non-zero entries (like 1s), the output is 0. So, the function is f(input) = 0 if input has any 1, else output is 0.\n\nBut in the examples, the output is all zeros, regardless of the input.\n\nIs that the case?\n\nWait, in example 1, the input is:\n\n0 0 0 ... 1 0 ...\n\nSo, this input has 1s in the sixth, seventh, eighth columns, and the output is 0. Similarly, the other inputs have 1s in columns 6,7,8 respectively, and the output is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the function is that output is 0 whenever any input has a 1, else perhaps it's the input itself. But in this case, all the outputs are 0.\n\nWait, that seems too simple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum modulo something of the input.\n\nWait, in example 1, the input has a single 1. The output is 0.\n\nIf the sum is 1, mod 2 is 1, but output is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the output could be some transformation of the input that results in all zeros.\n\nLooking at the input grids, they have a specific pattern. For example, in example 1, the first few rows are all zeros, then a 1, then a bunch of 0s, then 1s, then 0s, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the function is that for each row, the output is the sum of the entries modulo something, but in the output all the sums are zero.\n\nWait, but in example 1, the inputs have 1 in certain positions. If the sum of the rows is zero, then the sum would be zero.\n\nBut in the output, all the rows are zero. So, perhaps the function is that the output is the input's sum for each row, mod 2.\n\nBut in example 1, the sum of the fifth row is 1. So 1 mod 2 is 1, but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is the input's sum for each row, mod 2, but all outputs are 0. So, the sum of each row must be even.\n\nBut in the inputs, some rows have an odd number of 1s.\n\nWait, in example1, input row 5 is [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which has 1 one, so it's odd. So the sum is 1 mod 2 is 1, but the output is 0. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum modulo 2 of the entire grid is 0, but in the examples, the sum of all rows is:\n\nFor example 1, sum of each row is 0, since each row is all 0s. So output is all 0s.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the output is all 0s.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that the output is always all 0s, regardless of the input.\n\nBut that seems odd because the examples show that.\n\nWait, looking at the examples, the output is always all 0s. So, perhaps the function is that for any grid, the output is a grid of 0s.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to make sense. Or perhaps, perhaps the function is that the output is the sum in each row, but all rows sum to zero.\n\nBut in example 1, row 5 has a single 1, so sum is 1. Output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nWait, let me look again at the examples.\n\nIn example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n0 0 0 ... 0 1 0 0 ... (sixth column)\n0 0 0 ... 0 0 1 0 ... (seventh column)\n0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 1 ... (eighth column)\n\nSo, each of these rows has exactly one 1. Then, the output is 0 for each row.\n\nSo, perhaps when any of the input has a 1, the output is 0.\n\nSo, the function is that regardless of the input, the output is all 0s.\n\nBut then why is the Output 2 having all 0s, and similarly the others?\n\nWait, no, in example 1, the output is all 0s. Similarly, in example2, all outputs are 0s.\n\nBut looking at example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nFirst, looking at the examples, there are four different input grids and corresponding output grids. My goal is to figure out the rule that transforms the input into the output. \n\nLet me start by comparing one of the examples. Let's look at the first example:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 4 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput for this input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 4 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nSo I need to find the pattern that transforms the input into the output. \n\nLet me take the first input and see what the output is. \n\nInput line 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput line 1: 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the first five zeros become 0, 1, 4, 1, 1. That seems like some kind of encoding. Let me think of how to get that from the input. \n\nLooking at the input line 2: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput line 2: 0 1 4 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm, the input line 2 has a 4 in the sixth position, and the output line 2 starts with 0 1 4 1 4 1... So perhaps the 4 in the input becomes 4 in the output? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the first input line. Input is all zeros, except for the second element (position 6) being 0. Output line is all zeros except for position 1 being 0, 4 being 1, 1 being 4, 1 being 4, and 1 being 1. Wait, that seems like the input zeros become zeros in the output, except for position 6 which is 0, position 1 which is 1, position 4 which is 4, position 1 again 4, and position 1 again 1.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Let's see the first input line is all zeros except for the fifth position being 0, sixth 0, seventh 0, eighth 0, ninth 0, tenth 0, eleventh 0, twelfth 0, thirteenth 0, fourteenth 0, fifteenth 0, sixteenth 0, seventeenth 0, eighteenth 0, nineteenth 0, twentieth 0, twenty-first 0, twenty-second 0, twenty-third 0, twenty-fourth 0.\n\nBut the output line is different. Output is all zeros except for position 1 0, position 4 1, position 1 4, position 1 1.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me try to find a way to process the input to get the output.\n\nHmm, perhaps the output is a transformation where each element is determined by the input in a certain way. Maybe it's a kind of weighted average or some kind of encoding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is being transformed into the output by taking certain positions from the input and combining them in a specific way.\n\nWait, let me think: For each output line, what do the outputs have in common?\n\nLooking at the first output line: 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, the positions where the output is non-zero are positions 1, 4, and 6 (with 1, 4, 1). Wait, no, the output line is 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 ... So, non-zero in positions 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11.\n\nWait, not sure. Maybe the output is built by some kind of code where certain positions are being set based on the input.\n\nWait, looking at the first input line, it's all zeros. So what's the output? It's 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nWait, that's a single 1 and 4 in the output for the first line. Hmm, perhaps the first non-zero element is the first position in the input, but in the output, it's 1, not 0. Wait, but the input is all zeros. So, why is the output 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 ...?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is built by expanding each position into a series of 1s, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is built by taking the first non-zero in the input and outputting a 1, then the next non-zero and outputting a 4, and so on. But in the first input line, all are zeros, so how can that be?\n\nWait, maybe the first non-zero in the input is being split. For example, in the input line, the second element is 0, but the output has 1 in the first position. So perhaps the first non-zero is being set to 1.\n\nWait, but that might not make sense. Let me think of another way.\n\nLooking at the second input line:\n\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 0 1 4 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, in the input line, the fifth position (0) becomes 0, the sixth position (4) becomes 1, the seventh (0) becomes 4, the eighth (0) becomes 1, the ninth (1) becomes 4, the tenth (4) becomes 1, eleventh (1) becomes 1, twelfth (0) becomes 0, thirteenth (0) becomes 0, fourteenth (0) becomes 0, fifteenth (0) becomes 0, sixteenth (0) becomes 0, seventeenth (0) becomes 0, eighteenth (0) becomes 0, nineteenth (0) becomes 0, twentieth (0) becomes 0.\n\nSo, the output seems to have 1s in the positions where the input has 4s, 1s in the positions where the input has 1s after the 4s, and 4s where the input has 0s. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn the second input line, the fifth element is 0, but in the output, it's 0. The sixth is 4, in", 0.0], ["5", "<|user|>Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
